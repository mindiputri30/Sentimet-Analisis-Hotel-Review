5,Room was clean and neat. Food was good and atmosphere was brilliant. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Greenery view and it helps to have a calm stay at hotel. Highly recommend for families as there are number of places to visit and children's activities during the stay in Grand Hyatt.     
4,"A fantastic resort in a great location. Beautiful ocean view room with generous bathroom and wardrobe space. Club room included breakfast and evening drinks and canapés which were generous enough to cover an evening meal but a bit hit and miss in quality. Staff were lovely, friendly and helpful. Beautiful grounds, several pool areas and lovely restaurants. Only a short walk to Bali Collection with shops, bars and restaurants. My only complaint, why have a club access only pool (a beautiful area) which is free to anyone staying? It would be a great additional privilege for people in club rooms if it was genuinely only for those people rather than being overcrowded."
5,"We really enjoyed our stay. The staff were very accommodating. We ate in several of the restaurants which had a great range of food. The buffet breakfast is the best I’ve ever had! The beds were comfortable, the rooms were nice and cool from the outside heat. The swimming pool with two slides was lots of fun. The service at the pool was great too."
5,"Excellent , Start to finish this property took care of us. staff is great, flowers everywhere. Daily religious offerings. always please and thank you. Wonderful night market on the premises. Gym was great. The property ends with a sidewalk and 2 steps beyond that is the beach. The flight from North America is brutal so make sure you stay a while once you get there. Rates are extremely reasonable.  inexpensive for everything."
5,This hotel is really amazing. We had a wonderful time with kids. The staff is very helpful and courteous. Kids enjoyed the kids club and pool area. The rooms are very spacious and with beautiful interior.
5,"Could not fault our stay, the facilities are excellent, service perfect and lots of staff were always on hand even to just guide the way to breakfast of which there were three places to eat at. Four different restaurants to eat dinner at all were fab and did take away if required."
5,It was a great experience and services and all kind of facilities were state-of-the-art. The service team were very professional and helpful.  I am looking forward to visit again in next year meeting.  Cheers.
5,"GH is a true 5 star hotel. All staff from gardeners to management above expectations. Variety of food & entertainment options and, location on a beautiful beach meant we could bunker down and truly unwind. First time in Nusa Dua and so glad we chose GH!"
1,If you don’t like BUGS in your Bed do not come to the Grand Hyatt Bali. I don’t even want to rate this hotel at the moment.   It is 11 pm right now and approximately 1.5 hour ago my daughter layed down to sleep in her bed and found bugs on the sheet. First 2 and then 5 and then they were just everywhere. On  the ground on the floor on the bed. I am so disgusted and creeped out and feel like they are crawling in my hair.  We are also travelling with my mom who is almost 80 and when we asked to move rooms there were bugs in the room as well. I’m in one of the most beautiful places in the world and sadly I just want to go home.   Apparently these bugs are called sugar ants.   Note: I also have videos of the ants moving on the bed but I can’t seem to add videos 
4,"Grand Hyatt Bali is a hotel next to the beach. There are tennis court and spa center. I booked the spa service there and the people are very friendly there. Note that my room was close to the pond and if you don't switch on the air conditioner, which generates white noise, the sounds from birds and insects could affect your sleep."

4,"I had stayed in Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua Bali hotel 27 years ago, and until now It still can keep the service and ambiance very well. Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua Bali is managed very well, hoping you can keep the good things consistently in the future. "
5,"We had a great experience, the pools and the waterslides were appreciated by our kids. Landscape was impressive. A lot of trees, flowers, small lakes. Walking distance to Bali Collection. Breakfast might include more salads and fresh vegetables."
4,The place is very beautiful and well maintained. My only qualm is that the exhaust of toilet was not working properly. I raised a complaint but nothing happened. Except that everything was great. Staff was very supportive. 
5,"Service overall was superb and were given a generous room upgrade without asking. The room was spacious, clean and well-designed. It was an older design but perfect for its use and much bigger than similarly priced more modern rooms. The club room was fantastic, food and drink very good, only a little more choice at breakfast would have made it perfect. The grounds are huge and beautiful, pool variety amazing and the service there was some of the fastest I have experienced. Food and drink was good, however, we felt the Tempanyaki was only average and a little disappointing. The Italian restaurant and bar above was great though.  Our experience was a great one and excellent value compared to other higher-end hotels in Bali. I would recommend it highly and we will return."
5,We had such a brilliant stay at the Grand Hyatt. The staff were exceptional and we could not fault them in any way. They were so helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The resort is beautiful and very well maintained. It is a large resort and enabled adults to get away from the main children's play area if you stayed in the Club Rooms which is highly recommended. There were plenty of beach chairs both around the pools and on the beach. The food was great and there were a lot of choices. We actually only left the hotel once as we did not want to leave it as everything was provided. The Grand Club was worth the additional expense for drinks during the day and cocktails and canapes from 5-7pm each day. I could not recommend this hotel enough and will definitely…

5,"The truest reflection of Balinese culture in a 5 star hotel. This second stay with my family from Australia, to celebrate the birthday weekend for my husband. This time, we stayed at Belibis Villa. It is a front beach villa, that is fully equiped with large living room, a big dining table, an office space, many daybeds (inside and on the veranda) and super spacious veranda with a green big tree, 2 sun loungers and beautiful, highly maintained garden.  This villa would be beautiful choice to stay if you are with your family with kids, the place is safe and it gives you a direct access to go to the beach, and the main pools are just 5 steps away.  What I like about this villa (and Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua) in overall is their interior design: they maintained the standard of a 5 star…"
3,"Overall it was a great experience, and good room if you travel with kids. Food options are great. Walking distance to shops.  Only bad thing is inconvenient check out rush. Even you already requested late 1pm check out, they will still call your room at 11am, and room service still knocked on your door 11.40.  Dont bother ask for extended halfday. Even you are willing to pay for half day, one of the receptionist told us please FIND OTHER HOTEL. How would you push your business to deiffrent hotel? "
2,"Be prepared to walk for at least 10 minutes to get from your room to anywhere. Check-in process is painfully long. Took over an hour to get 2 small buckets if ice delivered to our room & only 1 arrived. Pool shuts at 7pm. This was not a 5 star hotel experience. Do yourself a favour & spend your money somewhere else. We were booked in for 6 nights but ended up leaving after 3.  We moved to the Hard Rock in Kuta, which was a much better experience. "
5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali hotel staff was very talented, understanding, prompt in services, polite, humble, smiling, cheerful, friendly, co-operative and efficient.  I am once again very thankful to Ms. Khisbi Azizah (Duty Manager) for her outstanding efforts and prompt assistance.   Best Regards ."
4,Another great stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali with the best beach of Nusa Dua and the landscapes and the pools of the hotel. But the rooms are looking really tired and worn out and  in dire need of a total refresh and renovation.   The stay was made special with the treatments and service of Pak Sutrisna and Ibu Suarni from the Grand Club Lounge who tirelessly serve the guests at the lounge and still keeping the guests drinks refilled ! Hats off to the energy these two provide to the Grand Club lounge and all the guests. They go the extra mile and requested the kitchen to prepare the Balinese sambal matah when they heard that we liked it ! Special commendations for these 2 staff

4,"This is the perfect location if you want to get away and relax. The resort is located in the resort area where only visitors are at the beach. The resort looked really nice and clean. I must say,  our room did seem a little outdated and our bed was too firm for our liking.   Aside from that,  the staff was amazing!   "
5,"Fabulous hotel, everything we needed and more. Staff were exceptional and nothing was too much trouble. Highly recommend the Grand Club booking as the extras you get are worth the little extra .Please use the safe in your room . We did and had no problems. "
3,"Overall Condition and the services from room to lobby as too far to work and limited or do not know how the service is made.  No short briefing for first time guest, probably need to ask this, so receptionist could explain more about the hotel, location, direction and how many parts/areas, how to go there, etc.  "
4,"always being back to this place again and again, the maintenance of the garden are very good, the wide location of the Grand Hyatt Bali Nusa Dua without making tired to wonder around, so much to see and explore, although it's quite an old building but still make me feel always at home"
5,"  Nothing was a problem , old school Hospitality. Just a pity so many kids! We bought a package holiday for the first time  Extraordinary value, we will definitely do it again.  Nusa Dua is the only place to stay in Bali."

4,"This was my second visit to Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua.  The first one being about 10 years ago (as a couple).   As soon as I arrived, I noticed a few things that indicated to me that the resort had gone to next level capacity function, and the check in experience wasn't as personable as it was previously.   No welcome drink, but you are directed to a refreshment station if you want one.   There were rope bollards to organize the queue to check in.   I imagine these things are needed due to the high volume of people they have staying there, but it made me a tad deflated that the resort was catering to the masses now. I had booked a Club King Ocean View room and was given a room on 4th floor as I had requested, if was at all possible.  The view from my room was just amazing, could not…"
5,"Beautiful hotel with very big and perfectly maintained gardens and pools full of beautiful Balinese design features. Several dining options, we recommend the traditional show and dinning at Pasar Senggol (local performers of high level). The beach is beautiful and big (swimming is possible during high tides: sand and clear water). The staff is amazing (attentive, kind): Mrs. Suarni at the grand club lounge and Ms Sari at the breakfast in the Salsa Verde are particularly nice. We would like to thank Mr Morissher Loduwijk, the manager for effective reaction to our minor complaints. We had perfect two weeks vacations, and spent all 14 days on the hotel's grounds as it is a lot of thing to do (kids activities, water sports, sport club with sauna and private pool, club lounge and…"
5,"The pool is very interesting, specially for children. The garden and the pond is beautiful, with the duck are swimming around, so interesting. Have the traditional balinese dance perfomance too on certain day."
4,"The Grand Hyatt Bali is definitely a show stopper. When you arrive and the hotel is above the ocean and looking down upon water gardens and open air beautiful spot, it really is a sight to see. The whole area was a lot more peaceful than other areas of Bali. It was a real oasis. The property is huge. It's really a family resort. It's dated, but the grounds are absolutely spectacular. We had a club level room so we spent a lot of time in the lounge. The employees there were always so friendly and hospitable. The ocean is possibly not the best for swimming, but it's absolutely beautiful. You can go to the pools and just stroll out to the sea. It probably wasn't super packed when we were there cause we never had to fight for a lounge chair. They always had ample nice beach towels.…"

5,"We loved everything about Grand Hyatt Bali! The staff were so lovely, hotel was amazing. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you for making our holiday a beautiful memory. We can’t wait to come back."
3,"Great service, Great staff, breakfast awesome, gardens and pool area beautiful. Unfortunately hotel in need of renovation , room old, basic facilities in need of upgrade. Not 5 star as suggested. Whilst great for young families, difficult to relax around the pool  as it can get noisy. "
5,"Beautiful place to stay, friendly environment, felt safe… pools were great…cocktails were fabulous…staff were happy to assist with the guests…beaches was lovely too … also the food was delicious 😋😊😘"
5,From the time we stepped into the room we felt at ease and relaxing. The beach and amenities is just great and it is like a wrold on its own! You could stay here and not leave the resort at all! The shops at Bali collection was also handy and close. 
4,"Couple of things. The hotel is massive. If you are looking for a more intimate setting, this isnt for you. Also we found the marble shower floor very slippery. Asked for a shower mat but they didnt have any. Had to use a towel to stand on in the shower. "

5,"My first trip to Bali. Chose 2 nights Hyatt after a few research online. Also, due to its stunning beach. I informed the GR team about our 10th year anniversary and they offered very nice cake and flowers with a greeting's card upon check-in. Appreciated for that. They also suggested us to make a nice dinner to celebrate at 1 of their outlets which also a good idea. When arriving, I was really impressed with the lobby ambiance, very exotic Balinese with open air, feeling very relaxing after a long flight. Entering the room, big big surprise that they have a so-called sofa bed but a really big bed perfectly fits in the corner of the room. It's the biggest and nicest sofa bed that I've seen, really can accommodated comfortably 1 adult, perfect for my kids. My room type is only a…"
5,"Perfect holiday destination for a family. The rooms are large as are the bathrooms. The facilities are great, but most importantly it is very safe for kids. Direct beach access, easy to get around, there is a mall and hospital down the road."
5,The hotel is so family friendly.  Buffet breakfast - all kinds of food - catering from kids to adults.  The pools really catered for families and were always clean.  The friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff. Closeness of the beach.  Lots of places to take a walk.  Feeling safe in this hotel and surrounds.  Couldn't ask for a better stay.  
4,Grand Hyatt is a great place to ich amazing scenery around the pool and beach area.  It’s extremely big resort and can be very confusing to get around the area.  They are generally very accommodating and most of the crew are great.  Breakfast is a bit boring some of the places
5,"service excellnece, room clean, toilet room good, housekeeping helpfull, refrigerator not cold, breakfast far from rooms but the food is good, Lack of directions sometimes someone can get lost, overall Good"

5,"We arrived to this beautiful hotel and the requests we had asked for were met. The staff at the reception desk were so lovely and helpful. We arrived to our room. The room was a little dated but was spacious and clean and well stocked with coffee and tea. Would have liked some water and milk in the fridge on arrival but that is only a small negative. The hotel grounds are beautifully kept, there are plenty of restaurants within the hotel to choose from. The pool areas are absolutely beautiful. All the staff from the reception staff, cleaners, pool attendants, gardeners, restaurant staff were outstanding. Their friendly manner and service is one of the best we have experienced. A special mention to Salsa Verde restaurant. The food was delicious and again, the staff were…"
3,"So I stayed at this same property over 15 years ago and it has not changed much. The infrastructure is dated but clean and functional. The hotel is focused on families with kids, so basically not the ideal tranquil Bali experience we were looking for. Our check in process was delayed, which was painful after our long flight in. Pest control needs to go up a notch we had a few instances of cockroaches in out room. Even though Irfaan their guest experience manager - comp'd our transfer to our seminyak hotel, it couldn't make up for the bugs. The breakfast and Japanese restaurant were good - their other food is mediocre. Our main issue was with the BEACH- it's way too rocky and absolutely no fun. The sunrise was the only saving grace. Most staff is friendly and accommodating. Would…"
4,"The hotel is good for vacation and healing time ...with or without family...  There is quiet place, good breakfast , nice pool and friendly employee..  The hotel near the beach' but cannot swim on this area.. but is fine ... I LIKE IT  Thank You FOR Hyatt Mgt. "

5,"This resort is full of surprises and no need to leave the grounds. It just ticks all the boxes for a good stay. We loved our room, great food, many restaurants, pools and awesome gardens. All staff were just so welcoming and simply the best.  "
5,"My husband and I recently had a perfect week staying at the Grand Hyatt Bali. It was just what we needed  to relax and unwind. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, the gardens are a feast for the eyes... Stunningly beautiful, colourful and manicured. We had a lovely, big, ocean facing room, it was super comfortable and quiet being on the top floor.  We also had access to the grand club lounge where we enjoyed beautiful breakfasts and afternoon drinks and very substantial canapes. If there is one small thing that we felt could be improved it's that it would be nice to make one of the several pools child free just to give couples and singles the chance to have a peaceful dip and time around the pool.  Overall we had an amazing stay and will definitely return. "
5,"Hotel gave great experiences During stay there. Really enjoy for staycation especially for family. Unfortunately, I wan't with my family. But, I will return with my family.  Breakfast has many choices. Great"
5,"Very impressed with the layout of the hotel complex. Facilities are well maintained and very clean. Staffs are highly responsive and helpful in all requests. There are different restaurants with in the hotel complex, very choices for food"
5,"Fantastic resort with amazing facilities and staff. The grounds are beautifully kept and pools were the highlight of our trip. Great location, close to the beach and shopping complex across the road. The hotel is very big, therefore the rooms felt very far away from the pools and restaurants which meant allot of walking with small children. Best family holiday we have ever been on. "
4,This is a huge hotel and one can easily get lost in the first visit. The service is very good and there are also many activities. The room is spacious and the view is nice but it is a bit dated and so the sound proof is not too good. There are three restaurants for breakfast to choose from and several swimming pools too.

5,"I've been travelling to Bali my whole life ever since I was a little kid. This is the first time I've stayed at the Grand Hyatt and I have to say it is one of the best hotels I've stayed at in Bali. I'm definitely staying here again when I'm back in Nusa Dua. The staff at the hotel, the food, the surrounding beaches, and the traditional authentic and detailed touches to the decor and architecture makes this place such a rich experience. My husband and I haven't stopped talking about bringing our parents and wider family to stay here so they can share our wonderful experience as it caters for all different age demographics. And lastly, thank you to the staff at the Grand Club Lounge for your hospitality. We always looked forward to your breakfast and cocktail evenings. You made…"
5,"Excellent. Enjoying the spa, food, beach and pool and always love the green and earth concept offered by Grand Hyatt!.  Pasar Senggol is always be my fave!. They offered various kind of traditional foods, and mini market that sell traditional handmade jewelry is the fave place for my daughter."
5,"We Loved our stay at the Grand Hyatt. I took my Mum and Sister and we all loved our stay. The hotel, the rooms, the staff, the food and the amenities…. 10/10. We can’t wait to head back to the Grand Hyatt for our next Bali adventure "

5,"Beautiful hotel grounds, the pool areas were spectacular. Wonderful service from all Staff we dealt with. Breakfasts were easy, so many food choices, wonderful selections. Cocktails were lovely...  A great stay for family with 2 children. "

Great Value, lots of food choices, great having different areas of pools, well equip gym, beautiful beach - tidal, over the road is a shopping complex, amazing service - highly recommend, especially travelling with family "
5,Stayed for 8 nights and we loved our time there. The staff were excellent throughout all areas of the hotel. We used several of the restaurants and all were high quality. Kids enjoyed all the pools and it was nice to have other families around for them.  
5,"Fantastic property, only bested by the quality and personality of its staff.  Must stay here. I come every year for an event, and they remember my name, my kids, names, and my preferences.  amazing.  Thank you Hyatt Bali! "
5,"Club access room a little dated but clean and spacious. A big resort, spread over 4 big blocks, surrounded by lush gardens.  We were happy we chose club access as the rooms are close to the reception area, the lounge, restaurants and pools. We enjoyed the tranquility of the club pool as there were many children in the larger pool area. The club lounge is generous with drinks and a small buffet selection/canapes that changes every evening. Staff welcoming and friendly. A very happy stay!"
5,"Hotel facilities were second to none. We swam, ate lovely food, met beautiful people in the Hotel who gave us plenty of helpful info, experienced Bali at its best. Volcano walk, temple, Waterbom Park with an online ordered gazebo complete with shower! We are definitely going again."

4,"It was a family vacation and we stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel for two nights. The hotel offers plenty of activities for family with kids. The staff at the front desk briefed us about the kids club and other activities offered by the hotel which was really helpful.   The hotel has three restaurants for breakfast with good choices of cuisines. At day one, we went to Garden cafe, near the lobby area, and on the second day we went to Salsa Verde, near the beach. While Garden cafe opens till 10:30 am, we could spend more time at Salsa Verde as the restaurant provides Brunch.   The room was quiet and large enough for a family. Our room was near the lake and was not too far from the lobby which was quite convenient. We enjoyed watching the white crane, the beautiful lotus flowers and…"
5,"My wife and I stayed for seven nights. The customer service and hospitality of staff is excellent. We loved the food quality and variety at the four restuarants and the Indonesian street market themed dinner on the Saturday night. The alcoholic cocktails were a little hit and miss with quality and taste. The facilities are clean and although the resort is ageing, the rooms were nice, the beds and pillows very comfortable and the grounds beautiful. I especially liked the Grand Hyatt club for breakfast and the pool was nice. Laying on a lounge beachside late afternoon was special. We had a great stay."
5,"Well maintained resort with delicious foods and beverages and great services. I personally recommend Grand Hyatt Bali and will come back someday for holiday. Although it is the biggest resort in Bali, the cleanliness and tidiness are very well preserved."
5,"Our stay was very enjoyable. The staff were very accommodating and extremely friendly. Our family felt very welcome in every part of the hotel including the restaurants. I would highly recommend staying at this location, it would possibly be the best in Bali. "
5,"We are glad to choose GH hotel for our hotel in Bali. Foods are delicious, Staffs are friendly. You will find smile everywhere. Kids love the water slide and pool. Beach just front of the hotel. There are 4 restaurants to choose. Very convenient "

2,"This is the first full day of our four day break. We have had to change our room. Leaking air conditioning. Not really anyone's fault.  However the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. Waiting to see the manager, all day. Still waiting for our luggage to catch up with us. So sitting in our second new room of the day in wet bathers. The first new room didn't have either terrace or balcony overlooking a cafe. Second new room fine but would I come back NO.  The Club Lounge is full of children. There seems to be no management at all. The greeting at check in was being pointed towards a cold drinks fridge and an iPad to check yourself in. Not what we expected at all.  Nice coffee. "
5,"Extraordinarily beautiful view in the hotel area, like a real painting. Plus direct access to the beach, you can play or just relax on the beach. The food and drink menu also tastes delicious. Really fun."
5,"My husband and I stayed for 4 nights at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua for our 29th wedding anniversary.   It was amazing.   The staff were so lovely and couldn't do enough for us.    The rooms were clean and reasonably spacious.   Comfortable beds and pillows.   All restaurants we ate at the resort were fantastic.    The breakfast buffet at the Garden Cafe was outstanding.    Plenty of restaurants to choose from and afternoon drinks on the beach or at the rooftop Salsa Bar were relaxing.    The beach here is beautiful at high tide,  few rocks at low tide but water still lovely.    Prices for food and drink at the resort are more expensive than say somewhere like Seminyak or Uluwatu but no more expensive than you'd pay going to a local Tavern in Australia.  If your looking for a…"
5,This is a fabulous resort with every amenity. I highly recommend getting the Club Lounge access - totally worth it.  Great location to begin and end our trip to Bali. We will certainly stay here again when visiting the island. 
5,All staff of Grand Hyatt are extremely helpful and nice. all facilities within hotel also perfect for family staycation. our additional request such as additional water bottle and sajadah are followed up immediately by hotel staff. all complementary also suitable for family vacation. thank you for your hospitality during our holiday at Nusa dua

5,"Grand Hyatt Bali has done a fabulous job in landscaping, gardening, cleanliness and security. We were greeted with big smiles by the security guards at the gate and by the hotel staff all the way till we checked in our room. Ocean view was great, we were given a room with a superb view. It was so relaxing to be seated at the balcony and in the room enjoying the breeze and listening to the waves. My husband kept sleeping in the room because it was just too relaxed and comfortable.  All your needs will be well taken care of. The hotel even offered to transport the luggages to the room during check in and to the lobby before check out. Service was prompt. There is no monkey, only a cute squirrel that jumped in our balcony. Grand club access is highly recommended, you do not really…"
5,Our welcome here was fabulous and the staff very helpful and assisted us greatly especially when Singapore airlines lost all of our family luggages and we spent 2.5 hours at Bali airport asking for our luggages...finally delivered to our hotel and taken to our rooms.

There was some confusion at the start as to what was included, we learned that the offer extended to all restaurants on the property. Adults receive an entree and a main, drinks are payable. It was more than enough food and all restaurants were divine! It was extremely good value for money.  The property is vast and the gardens, little lakes with beautiful ducks and even large lizards were so lovely and well kept. The kids loved the slides and spent most of their days there. I loved the cold plunge pool and the fresh coconuts. The beach is stunning, clear waters and low tides in the afternoons. We rented bikes and rode up and down the pathway along the beach, up to…"

5,What an amazing resort and amazing holiday couldn’t have asked for more the Grand Hyatt is a truly first class holiday  destination. The restaurant choices were all superb as was the food from all of them .The introduction of a continuous buggy pick up and drop off is a very welcome idea simply due to the size of the place 
5,"Fantastic resort, great rooms and gardens with the most friendly and helpful staff we have ever come across. Please attend to your WiFi as it isn't up to scratch and add some variety to the lunch options at the pool. Overall, we have a great 2 weeks at ther Grand Hyatt."

4,"This is one of the most beautiful hotel in Bali. A very big hotel with more than 650 rooms and suites . The rooms seem to be a bit old and need refurbishing. But the views of the hotel, gardens, swimming pool ( 5 in all) are very nice. The hotel has a private beach and from our room the view of the beach and the view of Water Lily ponds with ducks roaming around looks wonderful.  We are vegetarians so our request for some veg. items was met by the hotel upon our request.  Overall it was a perfect stay at Grand Hyatt !!"
4,The hotel is one of the biggest in Bali. The rooms are very nice as are the staff. There are a lot of families there so not good for peace and quiet. Kids are allowed almost everywhere.  I would have preferred a smaller hotel but overall a very nice experience.
5,"We had a wonderful 6 nights at the Grand Hyatt with the kids. The pool and slide were a real hit. The rooms spacious and really comfy beds. Great breakfasts too! Lovely staff. It’s right beside the Bali Collection where you can eat in other restaurants, find a pharmacy(bring your own sun cream as so expensive over there) and some shops. The spa was worth a visit too. The beach is super clean and lovely loungers there to use also in and out of the shade. We left just as it was getting really busy, people were putting towels on the grass as couldn’t find sun loungers but in saying that there were always some free at other points around the pool or on the beach, which is close to the pool. Shame you can’t swim in the pools after 7pm. "
5,"Hotel is very big, great private beach area. Always staff around and ask us food/ beverage. Kids had a great time in swimming pool, so many pools too. Food in restaurants also very nice. 5 minutes to Bali collection, we all went shopping after dinner. Club swimming pool is especially very relaxing."
5,"Absolutely amazing. Will definitely be back.  Everything about the place was perfect.  Plan to come back next year . food was great, staff were very helpful, and friendly, rooms were amazing . Transfers were on time and were very friendly and helpful. The pool was awesome .Can't wait to return . "

5,"Great location for a family holiday. Pools and especially water slide was perfect for our young kids. Remember to take an inflatable ring for the slides! Great choice of restaurants and beautiful grounds. Kids club was easy to access and enjoyed by the kids. Great that Bali collective was across the road and great for massages, pampering and a bit of shopping. So nice to not be hassled to buy things by the sellers around the area too.  Would love to come back in the future "
5,"Our holidays in Grand Hyatt were amazing ! We enjoyed the pool, beach and all the activities the hotel propose (snorkelling was wonderful and the photo session was nice too) ! The restaurant are all amazing ! Food is delicious and the waiters are adorable (Buda at Ampu, Adel at the Garden Café and Wiri at the Pool) ! The employees at the reception are also very kind thank you to Ernes for the check-in ! We also had a massage at the Kriya Spa and Putri and her colleagues were so perfect ! So thank to everyone that made our holidays so nice !"
5,"Love this hotel and this is our 2nd stay here. Well kept, beautiful gardens. Escape the busyness off Kuta and stay in a great resort, heaps of sun lounges by the pool, good priced food, 2 water slides, great kids club, nice white Sandy beach.  It’s only 250k for a taxi from the airport and I’d you wish to visit Kuta to do some shopping it’s the same price in a taxi, use Bluebird as they use a metre. Staff a friendly. The Kirra Spa is first class but if you want a cheap massage there are ones along the beach for $15 an hour or maybe even cheaper.  My tip would be to bring along your own pool ring for the slide otherwise you can purchase at the resort for $25. They will blow it up for you. We had the luxury escape package and hardly spent anything as all food was included making…"
5,"Every time I go to Bali I stop by here because the rooms are quite spacious and comfortable, the food served is varied and delicious. There is a swimming pool suitable for children. The beach environment is quite spacious for guests only."
5,Very Good The hotel was really amazing. When you are syaying there you dont actually need to go out and explore. Tha staff as well is very accomodating. Overall rating I will surely go back here. They made my bali indonesia trip unforgettable.
5,"Great location for a family holiday. Pools and especially water slide was perfect for our young kids. Remember to take an inflatable ring for the slides! Great choice of restaurants and beautiful grounds. Kids club was easy to access and enjoyed by the kids. Great that Bali collective was across the road and great for massages, pampering and a bit of shopping. So nice to not be hassled to buy things by the sellers around the area too.  Would love to come back in the future "

5,We loved our stay at the Grand Hyatt. The most amazing staff were always happy and helpful. We were always greeted with a big smile. Service could not be faulted. All restaurants and food were fantastic. The swimming pool was awesome and  the gardens beautiful. Fantastic holliday.
5,"We had a fantastic stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali! Very friendly and welcoming staff, excellent food, amazing service, nice clean and large rooms. Thank you very much for giving us a great experience! With warm regards, Remi Gerkens"
5,"We spend 3 nights at the Grand Hyatt and everything was amazing ! The outside (garden, pool and beach) of the hotel are outstanding ! The room was very spacious and the bed very comfortable ! All the employees have been so kind and professional !!! We could not thank everyone personally but we remember few employees that have been amazing such as Kerti and Nike from the Watercourt, Rawhiti at the Garden Coffee and Maria from the Spa ! So thank you to all of you that have made our stay so nice and relaxing !"
5," We took a trip to Bali to relax and unwind from the stress of work.  Nusa Dua is the place for this and the Grand Hyatt was exceptional.  We purchased the Luxury Escape package all inclusive of meals.  This was brilliant, didn’t have to put your hand in your pocket for anything other than drinks.  The food was exceptional.  Breakfast was buffet style which was great.  Lunches and dinners were at the restaurants, the portions were small but more than enough and 5 stars quality.   I feel this Hotel is family oriented but as a couple we wanted quiet places, we found the Balinese pool and that was very quiet with no kids running and making noise.  We loved everything about this place we will definitely be going back, we absolutely loved it. "
5,"The Grand Hyatt experience was amazing. The entire team of staff including food and drink, reception, pool, housekeeping, management and communication staff were fantastic and would bend over backwards to assist us when needed. The restaurants offered a variety of local and international cuisines and were all top class. The grounds are immaculately kept and there were pools suitable for us 'oldies' as well as for families with young kids. We will certainly be returning!"

5,"The hotel is really good and the rooms are spacious, the facilities are complete, the service is friendly, and the surrounding views are very beautiful. Close to the beach, very comfortable and suitable for those who want to staycation."
5,Overall experience to stay in Grant Hyatt was great. Kids loved the pool and kids club. Staffs were very helpful. Swimming pool and the lobby is the best place. Private beach was very useful to spend some quite time.
5,"The grand Hyatt is a beautiful resort the pools and surroundings are exceptional, in particular the main pool and the grounds where there are beautiful gardens and ponds. The restaurants served exceptional food and the service was exceptional. Our apartment was huge with beautiful views. The rooms were a little dated but exceptional in size and cleanliness. The staff are welcoming, helpful and very friendly."
1,"We recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali, it was a very disappointing experience after only in July staying at the Hyatt Regency in Capetown South Africa.   Where everything was perfect in Capetown Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua was the most disappointing from the first night we checked in, we had booked for a garden view room, instead our outlook was over the tennis court and miles away from anywhere.  We went down and complained bitterly and were allocated a club room with no club facilities.   My friends who had recommended the hotel unknowingly to us paid for club facilities as a gift to us.    The rooms were meant to be ready the same night because we had a baby with us we said we’d wait until the morning to move.  We were assured the room would be ready after breakfast as the…"

3,"Stayed for 13 nights for much needed vacation. Hotel location perfect, grounds very  serene. Beach front large. Hotel pools varied catering for families and couples. Rooms a bit dated for a 34 year old hotel. Staff very helpful. Location of first room poor, relocation no problem following day."
5,"Grand Hyatt is what dreams are made of. Expansive coastline, the pathways by the beach can be so rejuvenating for your soul. The room we stayed was king ocean view room and overlooked beautiful pond and ocean. The resort is a destination in itself. If you are in Bali and want your memories to last a lifetime m, then this is the place worth staying in. Thank you for this rejuvenating experience"
4,"With a name like Grand Hyatt, you expect a grand, upscale property and this Nusa Dua resort is just that.     It's located on a long stretch of pristine sand so if you're a beach goer, this is idea, particularly if you prefer the shade of a palm, listening to the big waves in the distance.  Just to say there's also a large span of very accessible water to play in and plenty of loungers situated under the sun.  If you're interested in some decent shopping, it's a 5 minute walk to an outdoor mall with some of the finer shops, restaurants and spas.  Another 5 minute walk further takes you outside of this kind of 'gated' area, to great street vendors,   As to the Grand Hyatt Bali property, clearly, the landscape designers and who ever directed them, managed to create something…"
5,"Spacious, clean, quiet room with all amenities set amongst colourful tropical gardens.  Lots of activities - tennis, table tennis, swimming, beach, massages, walks, shops, guides to direct. Staff outstanding - willing, informative and so obliging. "
5,Very enjoyable stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali. Weather was perfect and the gardens and hotel in very good condition. Didn’t realise the place was so big until we got there so was a bit of a hike to breakfast and to the pool so if you have problems walking a long way let them know before booking in. Place is very close to Bali Connection Nusa Dua easy walk. So if you want a relaxing no hassle holiday stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali

5,"We have just returned from our wonderful holiday at this wonderful hotel. The gardens are fabulous and the pool superb. Yes the rooms are older but are well maintained. The bathroom had new taps and basin. Many rooms were being refurbished but with very little impact on guests. Thank you to Koulos for our speedy check in. Jordie cleaned our room and did a great job. Big shout out to Agus, Ari and Bobo for their service around the pool."
4,"Great, relaxing holiday. Everywhere was spotless, pools and beach were great. Gorgeous landscaping but hotel a little tired in places. Not all facilities were available at all times during our 2 week stay."
5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali is an exceptional resort. You are greeted with live Balinese dancers. The grounds are exquisitely landscaped with tropical flowers throughout. The staff is fantastic, friendly & very attentive. The Regency Club is better than any of the previous ones I’ve visited. The food was plentiful & delicious. The beach area is beautiful. "
5,"Excellent buffet. Rooms were clean and spacious. Very good pool outdoor facilities. Staff were helpful and courteous. Lots of families. Did not travel during height of peak season, therefore cannot judge how facilities would cope under full capacity."
5,"I recently spent 4 days here by myself after travelling here with the family in April.  It's always a relief getting out of the hustle and bustle of the other side of the island and this hotel has it all. Great resort for families, couples or those travelling solo.  Staff are extremely friendly and accommodating and always go out of their way to make your stay pleasurable.   Plenty of pools available, great for relaxing or for the kids.   Restaurants are top notch with the newly reopened Salsa Verde a hit and it was great to return to Nampu for high quality Japanese.  Superb location with easy access to Bali Collection, markets, watersports and the blowhole.  This is definitely our go to hotel when travelling here again."

5,"This was our second holiday at Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua. It totally exceeded our expectations as Bali recovers from the Covid pandemic and visitors return. But the Hyatt staff were collectively welcoming, professional and constantly helpful to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Restaurant food standard is high and the pressure on seating will be eased with the reopening of Watercourt.   We have visited Bali numerous times and stayed at a variety of hotels in many locations. But we rate Grand Hyatt as the best."
5,"We had an incredible week staying at the Grand Hyatt, exceeded our expectations and we would happily visit again! The amenities were beautiful, the staff all lovely and always willing to accomodate our needs, especially with two young children. Highly recommend!"
5,"Enjoyed the overall vibe of the resort. Calm and relaxing. Paired with the level of service the staff gave, it was a wonderful experience.   Regards to the team: Breakfast at Salsa Verde: Anita, Dewi, Thea, Eka Jaya, Sanira, Rissa, Febri, Eka Ardana, Krisna. Front Office: Yobi (Bellman), Ngurah (Reception), Bella (Reception), Ince (Operator), Candra (Concierge), Adi (Concierge), Arjuna (Buggy Driver), Pande (Buggy Driver). Housekeeping: Bapak Purwa Engineering: Pak Andi  With special thanks to Khisbyah Nur Azizah, Ni Kadek Sutami, and Endy Hermawan from the front office for the amazing hospiltality"
4,"the hotel was all and more you'd want from a huge resort. the grounds were amazing! the staff were great and everything was nice and clean!!!!! Our only hesitation was Nusa Due itself and the distance to main attractions, key hubs like Seminyak or Changu. its nice to walk out of your hotel and be straight in the action, this is not what you get in Nusa Dua.  great place for a relaxing holiday "
5,"First time in Bali and loved our stay at this property. Rooms were great, loved the pool areas and being able to walk to Bali Collection was a bonus. Plenty of options to eat and drink and highly recommend paying the extra for the Club access. All of the staff were so helpful and friendly there is nothing to really complain about. I'm always satisfied when I get what I paid for."

5,"This was our 3rd stay and we never tire of the resort's amazing gardens, architecture and decor. The room was lovely. The staff, as always were outstanding, as one expects in Bali. The restaurants were all excellent - there are also beach warungs, other resorts and village eateries. The Grand Hyatt has the best beachfront in Nusa Dua by far, the only one with lovely shady trees. We kept active with lovely long beachside walks and a cycle around the local area and into the village. we also used the lap pool, sauna etc at the gym."
5,"Loved our 8 day stay.  Our room was spacious, clean and had a stunning verandah view overlooking the ocean . Room 2344 in the East wing.  Grand club was fantastic and definitely recommend getting this.  Loved the quiet east wing pool near our room. Perfect!"
5,"We had a great time at The Grand Hyatt.The staff were exceptional  food excellent,couldn't fault it .For a complete relaxing holiday ,and Bali Collection across the road ,you didn't want for anything .Beach right on the doorstep.  "
5,"This hotel is like a botanical garden, with beautiful flowers, lakes, and landscapes.  It has direct beach access and the beach was very nice.  We had an executive suite which was bigger than my apartment in New York, with a very large living and dining area.  The club lounge was also terrific - delicious food and various choices every day for breakfast and cocktail hour/dinner.  Everyone was welcoming and staff very accommodating."
5,"Pasek has blown us away with an unmatched attentiveness, outstanding personalised service and kind, compassionate and professional representation of himself. Out of all staff we encountered during our stay, he stands out as someone who went above and beyond and made our trip extremely memorable. Pasek truly deserves a promotion! "

5,"I stayed with my family for two weeks. The hotel exceded our expectations. Our room was big and clean (standard room). Staff was super friendly, good restaurants and shops. I would recommend this hotel tofamilies who want to visit Bali."
5,Beautiful beautiful hotel with a truly taste of Bali. Beautiful landscape with lots of trees and ponds. The design is traditional and old but i absolutely loved it. Honestly when im visiting bali and thinking about staying in a 5 stars hotel i prefer this kind of hotel which embrace the balinese in every inch of their design.   When you stepped into the lobby you will see balinese dancer and balinese music welcoming you into the mood.   Hotel is huge and pretty . They have huge pool as well.  Room is old traditional design but clean and well maintenance .  Beach is also amazing. Relazing and calming . What a holiday  The whole thing is making you feel like you are walking into a romantice lalaland hahahahah im not even joking . Well at least thats how i feel . I love this area…
4,Overall stay experience with ocean view was great and comfortable. Food is good and multi national cuisine at restaurants. Accommodation was good in ambassador suite room. Lot of places in Bali to visit and local cuisine is limited. 
5,We visited Nusa Dua for a week getaway and it was everything and more than we could have hoped. A beautiful property with sprawling lush gardens and several pools. Everything you could need in one place. The club lounge was well worth the upgrade and the food at club and salsa verde was 100 percent delicious.  Shopping at the adjacent centre very expensive but good day spas that offer pick up and drop off to hotel are available and shopping in the village is reasonable.
1,"We watched good review about Grand Hyatt Bali but it was not than our expectation.  Generally, staff is so nice and helpful but most of facility is too old and dirty. Club room has not that special than normal room and anyone can use Club lounge even they don't stay club room.  Overall, don't expect 5 star hotel service .. "

4,"A good place to rest and relax; Grand Hyatt Bali is huge, rooms are bigger compared to typical hotel rooms. We got 2 rooms for 5 pax and they able to give us a connecting Deluxe Kings rooms which is very convenient for us for we have young children. Rooms are huge, bathroom combines a walk-in closet, a bathtub a separate shower area and a toilet.  Additional extra-bed in every rooms (at least in East side) is not the typical couch or pull-out but a dedicated bed in the corner of the room (very relaxing to sleep) not to mention we also have balcony.  Rooms is not out-dated, power-outlets are designed to fit all of socket type plus they have usb ports provision on the wall, the IPTV must be improved though (laggy most of the time).  Wifi works as expected, water, heater etc are…"
5,"Perfect place to stay if you are looking for great pools, beachfront, large comfortable rooms, nice views and quiet. The friendly, helpful, pleasant staff everywhere in the resort and their lovely smiles made us smile and relax to enjoy our holiday. This hotel has a lovely long stretch of beach with plenty of loungers spread out under trees on the beach so you are not crammed in next to others or you can sit around the pools. The food in every restaurant was delicious with a wide variety available. We needed a Dr (viral infection not related to Bali) and the service was amazing, super fast and easy even after hours. We would definitely recommend and visit again. Thank you to everyone at the Grand Hyatt!"
5,"We had a wonderful stay.  It’s a great facility, attentive staff, good room. We will return.  It’s a good location away from the congestion of some parts of Bali.  However, while Hyatt is fabulous, it does not give you a feel or any sense of the real Bali.  It suits us fine after travelling around Indo.  We are well travelled around Bali and Java.  Hyatt is a nice escape for us.  But, if an international hotel is all you experience such as Hyatt, you have not really seen Bali.  Bali has a lot more to offer.  "
4,Lots to do  here but difficult to  find out  about it. Large apartments  but  there is a lot of walking to get anywhere. I must have walked 700 meters to get to some  restaurants. Food  could be  dangerous at the  buffets as  generally tepid  and  sitting  there  could be  incubating  bacteria by the end of the  meal  period. Beds  abit  hard  but mattress toppers  available on request.
2,"We’ve stayed in many 5 star resorts and between the condition of the property, overcrowded facilities and average food, I would give it a hesitant 3 stars. Certainly not a luxurious experience at all."

Additional extra-bed in every rooms (at least in East side) is not the typical couch or pull-out but a dedicated bed in the corner of the room (very relaxing to sleep) not to mention we also have balcony.  Rooms is not out-dated, power-outlets are designed to fit all of socket type plus they have usb ports provision on the wall, the IPTV must be improved though (laggy most of the time).  Wifi works as expected, water, heater etc are…"
5,"Perfect place to stay if you are looking for great pools, beachfront, large comfortable rooms, nice views and quiet. The friendly, helpful, pleasant staff everywhere in the resort and their lovely smiles made us smile and relax to enjoy our holiday. This hotel has a lovely long stretch of beach with plenty of loungers spread out under trees on the beach so you are not crammed in next to others or you can sit around the pools. The food in every restaurant was delicious with a wide variety available. We needed a Dr (viral infection not related to Bali) and the service was amazing, super fast and easy even after hours. We would definitely recommend and visit again. Thank you to everyone at the Grand Hyatt!"
5,"We had a wonderful stay.  It’s a great facility, attentive staff, good room. We will return.  It’s a good location away from the congestion of some parts of Bali.  However, while Hyatt is fabulous, it does not give you a feel or any sense of the real Bali.  It suits us fine after travelling around Indo.  We are well travelled around Bali and Java.  Hyatt is a nice escape for us.  But, if an international hotel is all you experience such as Hyatt, you have not really seen Bali.  Bali has a lot more to offer.  "
4,Lots to do  here but difficult to  find out  about it. Large apartments  but  there is a lot of walking to get anywhere. I must have walked 700 meters to get to some  restaurants. Food  could be  dangerous at the  buffets as  generally tepid  and  sitting  there  could be  incubating  bacteria by the end of the  meal  period. Beds  abit  hard  but mattress toppers  available on request.
2,"We’ve stayed in many 5 star resorts and between the condition of the property, overcrowded facilities and average food, I would give it a hesitant 3 stars. Certainly not a luxurious experience at all."
1,"We had food poisoning and a very unpleasant stay. The rooms are like a motel, stagnant water smells fill the air, and the design for standard rooms is not modern or befitting for a 5 star hotel. The garden and pools are beautiful however, the F&B in one of the restaurants is average. Avoid drinking the water at all costs."
5,"The Grand Hyatt is the best hotel we have stayed at in Bali, beautifully manicured and maintained, the grounds and beach are exceptional and the pools are amazing . We ate at all the restaurants and the food was always excellent, with Nampu being the best .   We will most certainly return . "
5,We had an amazing time at this 5 star resort. Very Close to shopping and restaurants. Nice beaches within feet’s of our room. Kind and friendly staff which makes it more memorable of a vacation. Definitely be coming back here again!! 
5,Beautiful hotel and staff. Grounds are amazing.  Food very varied and delicious. The only downside is that the sea is rocky so recommend u wear some kind of water shoes. If u have those u will be fine. 
5,"Went here with my 5-year old and we all loved it!! The place, the foods, the pool were all amazing! The room was a bit far from the lobby but everything else esp. the service and staff was great.. there’s kid club where your kids can do various activities. And there’s a direct path to private beach awesome"

5,We have stayed at the grand Hyatt several times and was not disappointed this time. Even though the buildings are a little old they are still delightful and maintain some Balinese culture. The grand Hyatt provides a real Balinese experience. We will be back. 
4,"We recently spent two nights at the Nusa Dua Grand Hyatt, and had a wonderful time. The room was spacious and felt luxurious, albeit a little rundown. The attitudes of the staff made our trip one we won’t forget, they were incredibly helpful and welcoming. "
5,Lovely resort with loads of activities. Kids love it specially the pool side.  One stop place when it comes to relaxation. Really loved it.  Beach is very nice and clean with multiple water sports activities. Must STAY place when you are at Nusa Dua ;)
5,"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel as the tropical landscape was really beautiful and it was clean and very well taken care of. The staffs were friendly too, always greeting you with a smile. Rooms were nice, cosy and spacious. It was beyond my expectations. The beach was my favorite part of my stay, it was breathtakingly beautiful, the sand was clean and it’s perfect for the kids to play at. Waves were pretty calm near the shore and the sea water was so clear! The beach was well maintained and peaceful. My kids love the swing at the beach, many memories were created there. Having breakfast at the hotel was another highlight for the family. The selection of food was lovely with lots of healthy choices. The menu changes everyday so it was exciting to look forward to breakfast…"
5,"Absolutely awesome place! Would stay here again for sure when we come back! Everyone was so nice and helpful not just about the hotel but about questions about the area. Beautiful hotel grounds, very well kept up and maintained. The spa was great as well. "

5,"Really nice resort with a very friendly staff. My special thanks to Pasek working at the swiming pool area, very friendly and kind, he definitely made our stay unforgettable. The resort has a very good atmosphere, quiet and relaxed from the lobby to our room. Very good experience."
5,"I was lost my voucher in room, but they were so quick to coordinate everyone to find my voucher. Less than 20 minutes they informed me that the voucher has been found. They did semt my voucher by post straight away after they find it. I’m grateful to stay with Grand Hyatt Bali. The service in restaurant was so quick. "
5,"This may be one of the older resorts in the area, but it delivers on customer service, great pools, beautiful grounds, and excellent restaurants. The location is perfect - one of the better beaches, and the Bali Collection shopping and restaurant district is just outside the property. "
5,"We stayed at the grand Hyatt as part of the luxury escapes package. We were a group of 6 (family of 4 incl 2 children aged 8 and 5 and the 2 grandparents) and everyone in the group had a lovely time. The children mostly enjoyed the pools (including the water slide) which were really well kept. Facilities are always clean and there are staff everywhere to attend to your needs and keeping everything clean and tidy. We had lovely massages at the spa, especially after such long flights. Our children weren’t keen on going to kids club, but when we had a look, it looked like the children who went really enjoyed it, with lots of activities on offer. Gym facilities are great and you can hire bikes from the hotel. My son and I went for a short ride along the beach path, but looks like…"
5,"The grand Hyatt Bali is my home away from home as a family we love to travel to Bali. We have been there three times now and every time we stay it gets better and better. Refurbish restaurants, a new exciting disco bar. It just gets better and better every time. I love it"

4,We researched lots to find the best resort for water slides for the kids. The one long one was pretty fun but on par with why I’ve seen at a council pool in Australia. The only other small one was the worst slide I’ve ever seen. The pool closed at 7pm and you couldn’t swim at night (this may be standard in resorts). We found that the resort was physically very beautiful but overall very expensive. 
5,"Great accommodation. With so much to offer to suit all travellers, especially families. Rooms were comfortable and breakfast was delicious. Staff were very helpful throughout our entire stay. Will definitely return."
5,"The experience at Grand Hyatt Bali definetly was worth the shot! The location of the hotel is close to a superb beach, which enters a strong cleaning process in the morning by the lovely and hard working staff. There are several security check , which adds a further element of safety to the experience! I definetly recommend taking a massage at the spa! The stuff knows proper english and you can pay everywhere by card with no extra fees like it happens throughout Bali.  The foods tastes great and the hotel offers a large variety of several cuisinies from around the wrold."
2,"We stayed three nights in hotel. First day my kids were playing on the wáter slide. The worker there have to give a ""stop"" or ""go"" sign. They give a go to my daughter when her sister still on the middle of the slide. The hit each other and my 6 years old have a pretty bad hit around the eye. Five days later still blue...In that moment we went to the enfermery and they even try to charge my 60$ for a negligence of one of their workers. The Next day some staff appear on my door asking for ""my other daughter"" to give a small present and Hope she get her eye better. They even didnt know the name of my injuried daughter even if I write It in the clinic. Second day as we got small kids, my wife and me reserve the spa in different times so one can check on the kids. After my wife…"

5,Very good food and service. Staff were amazing. Breakfast had plenty choice. Very good location and lot of activities to do. Swimming Pool were cleaned and whole resort is outstanding. Gym is also good. Night Market is also there 
4,Beautiful hotel that is situated in a great location with access to Bali Collection mall and beach.  Unfortunately one of the two rooms (2130) booked had an inherent AC failure which was not resolved despite various complaints during our week long stay.
3,Rooms interior very old needs uplift of furniture and walls. In room dining menu needs to improve. Timings of the restaurants should be till 10 PM at least. In my room there was lizard and that’s not acceptable at all.
5,"The location is absolutely marvelous! The beach has a fine , delicate sand and a spectacular view towards the ocean. Concerning the working staff, i could observe a high consistency of excellenece and remarkable customer experience, which further enhanced our holiday at Grand Hyatt. The resort was also very clean."
4,try not to get the rooms close to tennis courts I think it is West village. We had room 4141...horrible for a 5 star hotel. The hotel has seen its best days and needs to be refurbished. Especially those rooms in West. It has an amazing location and good staff and nice facilities for kids but the rooms could be much better.

5,"Great ambience, fantastic facilities, extensive breakfast options, beautiful location but above all- caring, warm, helpful, extremely friendly and lovely staff! A memorable and enjoyable experience staying here and we look forward to coming back again and again 😊 "
4,This is a huge resort hotel in a beautiful setting. We had a premium room which was great and gave access to the lovely Club breakfast area. The private beach is one of the best in the area. The hotel needs a refurbishment of the installation and an improvement of the food at the pool area and some of the restaurants. Otherwise great location with a shopping centre at walking distance. Can feel a bit crowed during the day at the pool area
5,"I rarely write reviews but then you come across a place and group of people that you can't stop yourself. Grand Hyatt Bali and the people here are one such experience. If you are with family and planning to go to bali, stop looking and just come to GH Bali and thank me later. Fantastic facilities, sweet and very nice people and a guest experience which we all look for in perfect stay. Grand Hyatt just became my go to place for all my future travels to Bali."

4,A very nice place to stay and great value when using Luxury Escapes. Food was very good and they can make pizzas. Japanese restaurant was very good as was all the others. Pool is starting to need a face lift and the accommodation will need one soon as well. Cocktail are of an average level. Found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Overall very nice and relaxing holiday with heaps of nice. 
4,"Pros: - Great service from duty managers when we had complaints about the noise from a wedding that was held for a few days at Grand Hyatt  - Various swimming pools - Great atmosphere, environment, gardens, flowers etc.  - Complete breakfast, choice between different restaurants with different atmospheres.  - Resort is enormous, from the gardens, to the pool to the beach.  - Nice kids facilities (games, painting activities).  - Great service from housekeeping (one night my daughter was sick and she puked, housekeeping came immediately and renewed the sheets) and also from baggage department to collect our bags.   Cons: - Rooms are quite outdated, but it's logical since it's already an older hotel in the Nusa Dua area. A renovation of the rooms would make it more appealing.  -…"
5,"We loved the hotel, staff were exceptional, food choice was great, plenty of places to choose to sit and swim for the day, we had a ""graden view"" room which overlooked beautiful gardens, screen doors open to the balcony was an unexpected bonus.

1,"If you expect luxury 5 star experience this is not the place to go. House keeping was appalling, not enough towels and amenities provided. Lizard and ants in the room. Air condition was leaking. Even after several reminders the towels were not provided. The rooms were cleaned at 5 pm everyday. Had to eventually walk up to the reception to send someone to clean the room. Huge resort, always overbooked. Not worth the money. Keep away if celebrating special occasion as we did, there are much better and cheaper resorts than this around Nusa Dua.  "

5,"This is a great resort, which we will probably come back to again and again. We travelled as a family group of 11 - ranging in age from 2 to 69. We had a Luxury Escapes package that included meals, which we felt was good value. Note drinks are expensive - similar to what we’d pay in Australia - but that’s pretty standard for resorts.  The rooms are a little dated but that did not detract from our experience. They were more spacious than expected, the beds were comfortable, and the air con worked great. We had a ground floor room in the south village with a patio overlooking a beautiful pond with lots of wildlife - we spent lots of time out there. Next time we would probably ask for a room on the top floor, as we had a noisy family above us which impacted our sleep a little.  The…"

4,"The Hyatt hotel is beautiful. The greenery, garden, ocean, ponds on the property has a definite “wow” factor. We loved the pool and the private beach. Pools were large enough to accommodate guests. We spent three days here but wished we had spent more time. The breakfast buffet was delicious. There’s so many choices. There’s a noodle bar, hot dishes and western style cereal and pastries. The only thing that can be upgraded are the rooms. The furniture seems a bit old drab and needs to be updated. There’s also a mildew odor in the cabinets where the kettle and complimentary tea and coffee were stored. Therefore, we did not use the glasses and cups in those drawers. The other strange thing we encountered was not being able to sign things to our room. We were initially able to do…"
5,Fantastic hotel with a wonderful team providing a really relaxing holiday experience.Balinese people are wonderful at making you feel at home in their country.They are so welcoming and full of help advice and tips about Bali in general. In summary a great holiday in a magical environment 
5,"Stayed at the villa Tambligan for a family holiday, for a week.  We’ve been staying at the Grand Hyatt, since 1997, first as a couple, then over time with our growing family (of five). This last visit with two teenagers.  The villa is exceptional, own pool and direct access to the beach and private beach area. Yes the decor is probably the same it was in 1997, but still looks good.  The villa comes with a butler, the ever helpful and happy Nunie and Mahendra. They really tried to go out of their way to help us, coordinating reservations, transport etc. they made the experience that little bit more special for us.  >Beach is glorious, location and transport from Airport to hotel is easy,  >restaurants are really great, highly recommend the Teppanyaki - real theatre and great…"

Yes the decor is probably the same it was in 1997, but still looks good.  The villa comes with a butler, the ever helpful and happy Nunie and Mahendra. They really tried to go out of their way to help us, coordinating reservations, transport etc. they made the experience that little bit more special for us.  >Beach is glorious, location and transport from Airport to hotel is easy,  >restaurants are really great, highly recommend the Teppanyaki - real theatre and great…"
5,nice pool for children with 1.2m depth and slides quite fun   great kids club with many activity in it such as animal feeding and games with the staff that so friendly has 4 breakfast places. all of them are so nice
5,"Took a liberty to visit for a few days on my own; chose to stay at Grand Hyatt as I stayed in other Hyatt brand hotels before although some comments from the internet sai led the property was dated. I think overall it is a fantastic property, good location, nice sandy beach in the front, lots of activities choices (I like the surfing lesson and the Balinese pool). Staff at the spa, the grand club and in general were super attentive and helpful. Talking to some of the guests at the pool they also agreed the hotel was very nice. Definitely come back if I return to Bali."
5,"Luxurious with beautiful and large gardens, with a wonderful beach by the ocean and many swimming pools. Great and varied food and friendly service. Close to the center of attractions, shops. We recommend the Devdan Show at the theater (9 minutes from the hotel) - a great experience and experience. "
2,Grand hyatt bali is actually the first hyatt i have been to that disappointed me. The staff are either overwhelmed or just slow as everything takes quite a while. The bellhops takes almost thirty minutes if you need them and one time they did not come even after following up twice and waiting almost an hour making me just carry my luggages to the lobby myself as I needed to leave already for my commitments. The breakfast situation was also very frustrating as they assigned me a table and i went to get food (and the selection leaves much to be desired compared to all the other hyatts) only to come back to see that they gave away my table! This normally wouldn’t bother me but what was annoying was that i was standing there holding both my plates as they take over 10 minutes to…
1,I would have reviewed this resort on Google as well but they have blocked reviews and the ones there are all fake. It is not a 5 star hotel. I doesn't woth the money. The rooms are dated & smelt musty. We suspected mold & had to ask twice before a de-humidifier was brought in. The rooms really need a deep mold check & are in dire need of updates. I will never come back or recommend this place  to anyone. 
5,"We stayed in the three bedroom villa and had the most wonderful holiday! We were spoilt rotten by all the staff who literally could not do enough for us. Nothing was too much trouble from the moment we arrived. The food was delicious and all our activities and transportation was arranged for us. The accommodation was immaculate and the gardens were breathtaking, so beautiful. We would like to personally thank Nunie, Mahendra, Ary, Saputra, Jasmini, Sri and Suarta for taking such good care of us. Many thanks. We will definitely be back!"

5,"All Good, the vibe of hotel is very nice, the pool so huge & there's a water slide for kids, direct access to the beach, very closed to Bali Collection Mall, the location is very good at ITDC Nusa Dua"
5,"This latest stay surpassed expectations. Having stayed at this resort before we were expecting quality of service, this was our first experience with the Club and the level of service exceeded our expectations. From the attentiveness in the lounge to the care in the service of the room.    "
5,"Just returned from our second holiday at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua, and yet again did not disappoint.  We booked on a Luxury Escapet deal.  We had access to club lounge and pool area this time which were fantastic! No need to leave the resort at all if you don’t want to!The hotel is over 30 years old now and yes the rooms  puke probably do with a revamp but having said that they are very comfortable and kept exceptionally clean, I’d say the housekeeping here is the best around, prompt and efficient, and like all the staff always polite and cheerful. The grounds are beautifully kept, and pool areas are stunning We’ll definitely be back again’"
5,"We partnered with Luxury escapes for our stay which was all inclusive which meant we literally did not have to leave the resort, aside from exploring as all the pools and restaurants etc we of a super high quality and very attentive to our daughter that requires gluten free food at all times. Cant wait to get back there again!"
5,Love the room and hospitably. Staffs are helpful. Very relaxing enviroment. Love the private beaches and the complementary photo shoot. the rooms are large and view from the balcony is amazing. there is ducks swimming in the lake which is very relaxing and welcoming.

5,We had an amazing holiday at Grand Hyatt Bali. Travelled with 2 young kids. Staff were so friendly and always happy to help. Natural rock pools and beautiful gardens set this resort above the rest. So much space and choices for food. Right next to Bali collection. Beautiful sea breezes through the resort. We miss it already and will definitely visit again.
5,"Stayed here last year. Loved it so much we came back again this year. The staff are the friendliest, and most helpful. The suite was amazing again, though wish it was ground floor. The suites are getting a bit tired. A couple of our doors to the balcony were really hard to open, but nothing can change how we love this hotel."
5,"Absolutely amazing! Beautiful resort, great amenities and amazing food at a variety of restaurants. Lovely beach and definitely recommend borrowing some bikes from the gym and going for a ride!  The staff are excellent and always more than happy to help, especially Arta who served us in the Japanese restaurant.  My husband was sick for a few days and we called the resort clinic. The doctor came to the room to check on him and was lovely and quite thorough. This was a relief as sometimes it can be scary being unwell in a different country!  The buffet breakfast was next level and the resort is close to markets and a shopping strip called the Bali Collection.  Overall, I would definitely stay here again, it was just perfect! "
5,"Full Family satisfaction,Please where you can stay for long time in a day..swim,lazy walk,Beach walk,Swim in Beach,Food in swiming pool,Lounge activity realy good and long time to remember,For me and my family it was a short break but we want to stay more longer and specialy in the hotel,,"
5,"It has been many years in between our first and then this stay at Grand Hyatt Bail and we were not disappointed. An amazing property with great facilities to relax almost on the beach, dine in air conditioned comfort or under the stars or head to the well-fitted out gym - while being to keep in touch with work communications via consistent internet quality.   The staff make the difference - there is no one at this property who is not friendly. professional and well trained - a great team. We'll be back again."

5,"Had a stay for 2 nights and this hotel is the right places to chill with family. They have a pretty big pool, clean beach and many areas for strolling around. Starting from the entrance, the concierge and reception team are very friendly and informative. Would like to give my special thanks to ibu Ninik from the front office who greeted us upon check-in. Room is spacious, also, we got to enjoy the view of duck swimming around the pond in the morning that i'm not sure if we can found it in other hotels. Got a chance to enjoy breakfast at the grand club and we enjoyed it as well with the calming ambience."
5,"The room is good even too big if we are traveling alone. The restaurant is good and clean. The pool is good for playing, relaxing and exercising. I haven't seen if you are providing bicycle it would be much better"
5,"What a wonderful experience. The resort is spread out over a large area and divided into sections. Whilst you are encouraged to have breakfast in the restaurant closest to you, each of the restaurants provide a magnificent buffet breakfast (or al carte if you want) Each of the restaurants offer a different experience ranging from a Balinese  one, surrounded by water pools, to a more modern cafe type style. This means there was an opportunity for a different meal experience every night, and all of them were excellent. Add the marvellous service to the equation and this is a recipe for a very relaxing stay. We were there during school holidays and the pools were filled with excited and happy children (who all cleared out at 5 00 to go for dinner) but in any case , we spent a lot…"
5,"Room needed a refresh especially with more ports and universal outlets.  Other than that, they are still very comfortable.  The soul of any hotel is its staff, and the people here at Grand Hyatt Bali are simply amazing!!"
2,"The landscaping is superb, but the food quality is under rate, some of the facilities in side the room need a major upgrade, the privacy (such as the quietness must to be kept in all time after 10pm)."

5,"A beautiful place and amazing stay. Highly recommend. Rooms were clean and comfortable, aircon was excellent due to the heat of the country. Staff was super friendly. You can walk out the bottom of the resort, straight onto the beach."
2,Add activity in the beach and swimming pool for kids/adults. Examples: aerobics for adults in pool. Volleyball in beach. Provide foot balls for kids/adults. Train staff sboit halal food. Create vegetarian table in the grand club restaurants 
5,"Biased about any Hyatt hotel because it’s my preferred brand. I’ve no complaints except a few staff are slow in delivering your request, whether it’s at the restaurant or room service. I guess it’s a cultural trait because I experienced the same service in other areas of Bali, not just at this hotel.   1) Great selection of food especially for breakfast  2) Room decor isn’t modern but fitting for a beach resort  3) Various pool choices  4) Good sand in front of the beach   It’s also great for family vacations as I saw lotsa kids and the place has a daycare or nursery area for young kids. "
4,"Best hotel with super friendly staff. They were very helpful at all costs, even lost my room key but was given a new key hassle free. Got lost going into my room but was escourted safely to my room. Best sea view and awesome bar & resturant. "
4,"The landscaping is amazing with lots of water lilies and water falls.  The beach is pretty much private, big, and has lots of trees for shade if you get too hot in the sun.  Lots of pools with 1 big water slide and a baby one.  Lots of trees so you can find shady areas to relax near the pools.  Breakfast buffet doesn't have a lot of selections and not as good as Hilton or IHG.  The restaurants are very expensive.  The pool side food is good and not expensive.  The rooms' decoration look a bit aged. Lots of nearby restaurants.   "

5,"We had a great and wonderful time with our family.  The resort is quite old (opened in 1991) but not outdated.  The pools are outstanding, we tried the main pool, river pool, and balinese pool. The river pool is very nice, it feels like swimming in a real river with all the rocks.   Breakfast is terrific with many options for healthy food and drinks.  The grand lounge also offers great food with unlimited alcohol drinks.  The gym is excellent, with squash court and different swimming pool from mentioned above.  Kids club provides many fun activities,  must try for your children, surely will have great time with so much fun.   We also had so much fun at the beach. There are no rocks on the sands (unlike some other part of Nusa Dua beach).  Overall, it's great for families. Very…"
4,"We enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt. The hotel has a Balinese character throughout and the grounds are beautiful.   As my wife had booked for my 30th birthday, the hotel upgraded our room and delivered a chocolate cake - a lovely touch. The room itself was really nice. We found the staff to be friendly, welcoming and helpful.   However, throughout the hotel, we found that service could be particularly slow - which is something that surprised us for a 5-star hotel. This wasn't a major problem but it happened often enough for us to notice and comment on it.  I was also far from impressed when I tried to book a taxi from the hotel to go to the Melia Bali Hotel for dinner. Despite being the hotel next door, the staff member tried to quote us 400,000 IDR. I thought I misheard him…"
1,The staff here was very unprofessional ! The pool turned my bathing suit brown !  The room had a bad smell !  Bugs in my breakfast !  Concierge had no idea about anything!  The guy who orders you a cab was so rude ! Nothing good about this hotel find some other place to stay at … you are welcome

The rooms are well equipped with everything you need, including a glorious shower with rain drencher, a wardrobe area with ample room for luggage, a day bed, balcony or patio area, and a bed that feels like a cloud with nice squishy pillows!   The staff are what makes this property such a great overall experience, nothing was an issue, and 24hr room service was very handy, they even helped adjust the mini bar menu to suit my needs which was great. Awesome location, awesome amenities and everyone was willing to go above and beyond.  Can't wait to come back, I love Bali !!!"
4,"We loved our time at the Grand Hyatt. It ticked all the boxes of a resort holiday, the huge and expansive main pool with waterslide meant that kids were well entertained and Mum & Dad could relax poolside with a lunchtime cocktail and a book over the first few days. Just what we were looking for. The main pool gets understandably busy but there are other quiet options to retreat to when that happens. That said it wasn't all about lazing about for us and, as an active family, there were plenty of other options to keep us entertained over the course of our 10-day stay including a well-equipped gym, tennis and squash courts, beach volleyball and bike hire.  It's worth noting that the property is older and is in the process of being updated and renovated. The positive is that with…"
5,"Place was so amazing. The restaurant great and all the staff were so friendly and accommodating. The pools were lovely and gave it a very nice jungle/rainforest kind of style with all the greenery and ponds. Quite large but never felt too busy. A lot of young families were there but didn’t really bother us.   Some great features include the hot and cold pools in the fitness centre, and lots of entertainment at dinner. Squash courts costed $5 but was worth it. Also the massage was top level.   Ultimately would highly recommend. Had a great stay. "
3,"We had a lovely stay here at the Grand Hyatt with family friends, rooms are clean and spacious and grounds lovely however pool side food is one of the worst we have experienced. Breakfast was fine. However we opted to eat at other hotels for evening meal as food was very average. Please also don’t wear good bathers to this hotel as the pool turns them orange. All our bathers ruined."
4,"Great resort with beautiful beach fillled with serenity and beauty with lots of restaurants and shops inside. This resort is also in close proximity to ""Bali Collection"" l, in Nusa Dua, which has many more food outlets and shopping stores for tourists to try... lovely place and lovely people.. highly recommended.

2,"Problems with room’s maintenance, hotel is a massive maze, long walks to anything you need and lack of signage so very confusing. No happy hour and terrible cocktails( not what aussies want on holidays). No tap beer (personal). Average breakfast and never changes, the free 5-7pm food and drinks ( well you pay for it as extra) is terrible, not worth it apart for the beverages. A lot better hotels in area with better pools, happy hour and everything."
4,"The grounds of this hotel are second to none, however, the rooms are a little outdated. Service was good, but not outstanding, as would normally be the case in a 5-star resort. Excellent buffet breakfasts, but lunch and dinner average and expensive. Beach outside the resort was covered in rubbish, which was buried each day (rather than being removed) and resurfaced with the outgoing tide. Mattress was extremely hard, although after 3 requests, an overlay was provided that made the bed quite comfortable. "
5,"Provided the great Grand Hyatt experience consistent across the hotel brand. Nice pools with kids slide, fronting on to nice sandy beach albeit quite a lot of rubbish washed up. Nice to be able to walk across the road to the Bali Collection Centre where there are more restaurants and shops.  Be sure to book beforehand at the Hyatt restaurants as usually full if you just turn up. There is also a fire dancing show at sunset nearby on the headland with a water blowhole."
5,Great experience at GH Bali. The team looked after our group ( of which many are seasoned travellers so maybe even bit spoiled haha) inan excellent way. The hotel was fully booked and at full capacity with conferences but we the staff had all the time (or gave that impression) in the world to look after us and made us feel special. Highly recommended.
5,"Beautiful hotel with flawless landscaping and amenities. Pools and ocean are clean, several pools to choose from. Peaceful and relaxing atmosphere with several shops across from the hotel (American prices). Highly recommend staying here if visiting Bali, Nusa Dua area very well kept as it is mainly tourist hotels, can get a Grab (their version of Uber) if venturing out"

Beach outside the resort was covered in rubbish, which was buried each day (rather than being removed) and resurfaced with the outgoing tide. Mattress was extremely hard, although after 3 requests, an overlay was provided that made the bed quite comfortable. "
5,"Provided the great Grand Hyatt experience consistent across the hotel brand. Nice pools with kids slide, fronting on to nice sandy beach albeit quite a lot of rubbish washed up. Nice to be able to walk across the road to the Bali Collection Centre where there are more restaurants and shops.  Be sure to book beforehand at the Hyatt restaurants as usually full if you just turn up. There is also a fire dancing show at sunset nearby on the headland with a water blowhole."
5,Great experience at GH Bali. The team looked after our group ( of which many are seasoned travellers so maybe even bit spoiled haha) inan excellent way. The hotel was fully booked and at full capacity with conferences but we the staff had all the time (or gave that impression) in the world to look after us and made us feel special. Highly recommended.
5,"Beautiful hotel with flawless landscaping and amenities. Pools and ocean are clean, several pools to choose from. Peaceful and relaxing atmosphere with several shops across from the hotel (American prices). Highly recommend staying here if visiting Bali, Nusa Dua area very well kept as it is mainly tourist hotels, can get a Grab (their version of Uber) if venturing out"
5,"Our ocean view room was lovely and spaceous,  the grounds and gardens were beautiful, food was good.  All the staff we encountered were helpful and very friendly.  However it is very family orientated, so the pools were crammed, but we did find a nearly empty pool in the on site sports centre were it was quite serene but did not sell drinks or food there, only a cold water machine."
5,Very relaxing family holiday. Only downside were the pillows  Food and service were absolutely outstanding. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful at all times. It was our second stay and we would definitely stay again 
5,It was great experience. Love it. Will come back again. Staff was great. Food awesome. Location of the hotel and view from room was excellent. All the facilities was nice. Very much kids friendly and family oriented. 
2,"Hello! I had a five-day stay at Grand Hyatt Resort. This resort is very old and the staff service is average and slow. It doesn't justify the amount of money you pay because, being relatively large, they are unable to provide good service to the guests. On the day I wanted to check out, I had to wait for an hour. When they came to open the room door, there was a problem with the lock and it wouldn't open. They didn't understand English well either. It wasn't a good experience for me. Additionally, the restaurant had a small size and was relatively crowded for breakfast."
5,We had the most fantastic stay at the Grand Hyatt. The swimming pool & facilities were amazing. The beach was beautiful. The staff and their friendly service really made our stay there. I can’t wait to return one day.

3,"After staying at the Melia Nusa Dua, then in Seminyak at the Double Six we expected another wonderful week at the Grand Hyatt. Unfortunately that was not to be.  We upgraded our room to a quite ocean view well to be woken every morning before 6a.m. by noisey children surely is not acceptable.    Inclusive meals should mean just that but you are asked to pay extra for a side dish. I wouldn't recommend this resort there are plenty of other beautiful places to stay.    The spa complet Booked out and same menu day in day out. Grand Hyatt you must be able to do better.  "
5,"Top. Holidays""  Jul 8, 2023  jaap h, Zaandam, The Netherlands We have been to Bali about 12 times and can only say that Grand Hyatt Nusa dua is a very nice resort. Especially the maintenance of buildings and maintenance of green facilities very well. Furthermore, very friendly and willing staff, nothing was too much for them. Beach facilities are very good such as sun beds, service for drinks, food and also cleaning of the beach. Room was very large and was kept clean. Dinner was of good quality and affordable. Conclusion no complaints and "
4,"A very nice hotel to stay. You get beach just a few steps away from your room. My kids were happy. Breakfast is good. Please serve more meatballs in the future. For my business, Karangasem hall is great. What you need is just more rest room nearby the hall.     "
5,"An incredible pool that winds along the beachfront and loads of gorgeous gardens.   They’ve got lots of trees providing shade over water and the lounge chairs near the water. You never feel like you’re out in the open sun so you can spend as much time as you like. The larger waterslide is fantastic for kids and grown ups.   The beachfront had loads of lounge chairs all shaded by trees.   Great location just 5min walk to the mall at Bali Collection.   One of our kids had an injury and every single one of their staff went out of their way to help us out. Simon, Ninik and the team literally rescued our holiday from disaster.   All of their staff are so friendly with smiles on their faces all day long. They were very helpful and respectful.  It is a huge resort with lots to do and…"
4,"Loved the breakfast and the grand club lounge happy hour. The menu changes daily so we had so much variety. Kids club was more catered to younger kids so my 11 yo and 9 yo didn’t use it, which was disappointing. The pool slide and rock formations were awesome. , as were all the perfect looking frangipani trees across the resort. Should have been told with the paid activities from the daily activities that we have to book a day ahead. Grand Hyatt made up for it though for its beauty, fab facilities and wonderful club lounge experience."

5,My wife and I had a great 1 week experience. We were so impressed with all the staff and noticed what felt like an honest care for us. The gardens and beach in the Hyatt and also around Nusa Dua are kept at an incredibly high standard which far exceeds anything we have ever seen in Bali. The food and room were of a high standard. The Hyatt is more expensive than most other resorts but we will choose to stay here next time we return

4,"We are currently in the middle of a large family holiday (8 adults and 5 kids) at Grand Hyatt Bali....whilst the property is a little dated, it's still really nice! spacious rooms, amazing river pool for the kids with a water slide and nicely situated right on the beach. What makes this resort extra special is the hospitality provided by the staff....especially Yulina who supervises the front desk. She has been amazing and has gone out of her way to make sure we are comfortable (e.g. we had an early morning flight and arrived to the hotel at 8am and even thought they were at full occupancy, she was able to arrange a temporary room for us until our room was ready in the afternoon)  We still have 3 days to go and we are already looking forward to our next trip here."
4,"Compared to other areas of Bali the lack of traffic on the streets outside the hotel was a highlight making it extremely easy to get a taxi if you needed not like the noise and the 1/2 hour ++ wait in Kuta.  This is a large beachfront hotel with beautiful ponds, gardens etc but it is often a long walk to get to and from your room.  The number of restaurants available did overcome the distance problem unless you wanted to have breakfast in peak time and may have to keep walking to find a restaurant with space.  We found the food and drinks to be reasonably priced, but the menu between them was a little too similar for a lengthy stay, wish there was blackboard specials or a little more variety between the restaurants.  There are many restaurants in the Bali Collection just across…"
5,"Great getaway, popular with families with kids. If you don’t like lots of kids around you then this may not be the place for a quiet holiday. The best part is the gym. Olympic bars and weights, Smith machine and an assortment of cable machines, dumb bells, leg presses etc. plus the usual aerobic training equipment. Also a hot and cold spa."
4,"The Grand Hyatt is a beautiful resort, great location on a beautiful stretch of beach with lovely views. The staff go out of their way to be helpful and are all so friendly. The only downside is this resort is only suited for families with children, traveling as a couple celebrating our anniversary it was not ideal, large loud family groups, hoards of screaming kids constantly day & night! In the evening after dinner there is nothing to do, the only bar (Salsa) was closed for renovations which was very disappointing. Other neighboring resorts had multiple bars and entertainment venues nearly all on the front overlooking the beach/sea, at the Grand Hyatt there was nowhere to sit and have a drink in the evening apart from the boring lobby bar. We did use the ‘adults only’ pool but…"

If you're wanting a romantic holiday for adults, this might not be the best place for you, as very noisy and kids take over the pool.  Beach amazing and most adults tend to use the beach area.  Great beach path which is good for walking or running.  This area is very hotel/resort orientated. so good for relaxed holiday, but not if you want to party.  "
4,"Beautiful resort in Nusa Dua fantastic for families or couples, great selection of restaurants on site or a short walk across the road to the Bali collection for the best coffee at Dua Kafe.

Staff and service were excellent, five onsite restaurants to choose from, and many more options across the road in Bali Collection complex. Some reviews say resort is tired, on the contrary we thought hotel was well maintained and had amazing facilities, grounds and feeling. Nusa Dua location was nice and more quiet for family stay; you might not choose it if you’re younger or want more night life. We would stay again happily."

Overall we enjoyed the gardens and all the outdoor activities so much. We had free photo sessions but could not do it due to very strict timeline. Such a shame, I wished for more flexibility and more available slots. "
5,"I am staying at present at the Grand Hyatt.  I just want to give those who have booked with Luxury Escapes the heads up.  Book your complimentary i hour  massage, as soon as you arrive!  I arrived Thursday night, walked down to book for next week,(today is Saturday) and the earliest available spot is next Friday, I fly out Thursday, so I will miss out.  I was so looking forward to it!"
5,"From start to finish we enjoyed our stay. The staff could not do enough for us,always friendly and wanting to please. The grounds are huge( 40 acres) and are superb,well established and tidy. Our room ( king ) was spacious,clean and well serviced. Always clean linen for our 10 day stay. Plenty of food choices from the resteraunts with attentive service. Check in and check out seamless. The beach is amazing and not crowded. There are some lovely quiet corners if you want to keep away from the children . We shall be back next year! The only thing missing is perhaps a more informal bar but it did not detract from our stay. We wanted peace and luxury which we did receive 😊. Well done!"
4,Stayed in a suite in the North Village and just loved the room. Very spacious with everything you could possibly need for a more than comfortable stay. All service staff were excellent as were most of the facilities. Beautiful clean white towels delivered every day with ample supply of still bottled water. The service from check in to check out was just superb. 
5,"The Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua is a sensational hotel and we will be back. Our basic room was anything but and our garden view was beautiful. The room was spacious, well appointed and impeccably clean. Although the hotel has 600 rooms it never felt crowded due to the resort’s acres of beautifully  landscaped gardens, multiple pools and restaurants and the easy access to the lovely beach. The real highlight however is the staff who are universally smiling, genuinely helpful and friendly. The only area for improvement would be in terms of the food quality from the pool bar and Balinese restaurant. Overall we loved it!"

Our room ( king ) was spacious,clean and well serviced. Always clean linen for our 10 day stay. Plenty of food choices from the resteraunts with attentive service. Check in and check out seamless. The beach is amazing and not crowded. There are some lovely quiet corners if you want to keep away from the children . We shall be back next year! The only thing missing is perhaps a more informal bar but it did not detract from our stay. We wanted peace and luxury which we did receive 😊. Well done!"
4,Stayed in a suite in the North Village and just loved the room. Very spacious with everything you could possibly need for a more than comfortable stay. All service staff were excellent as were most of the facilities. Beautiful clean white towels delivered every day with ample supply of still bottled water. The service from check in to check out was just superb. 
5,"The Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua is a sensational hotel and we will be back. Our basic room was anything but and our garden view was beautiful. The room was spacious, well appointed and impeccably clean. Although the hotel has 600 rooms it never felt crowded due to the resort’s acres of beautifully  landscaped gardens, multiple pools and restaurants and the easy access to the lovely beach. The real highlight however is the staff who are universally smiling, genuinely helpful and friendly. The only area for improvement would be in terms of the food quality from the pool bar and Balinese restaurant. Overall we loved it!"
3,"Update the beds- they were terrible even after switching rooms.  We also should been offered more than one free breakfast for this.  Most hotels in Bali already offer complimentary breakfast.  Also, there is not place to just get coffee in morning:  the rooms are older and need updating.  Nescafe packets won’t cut it for. 5 star, but realizing 5 star in Bali may not meet 5 star western standards.  The beach was best part and the restaurant options.  It is full of Australian families, which is fine we as a couple were still able to enjoy.  The beach offers a massive amount of quiet space.  I would stay here again if rooms and beds get upgrade.  Being from US, we can get same experience in Hawaii.  There is no culture in Nusa Dua.  We went here after 2 weeks experiencing all of…"
4,The hotel and pools were beautiful and breakfast buffet was amazing! I stayed here for a music festival and could not have asked for a better location.  Our room was always cleaned perfectly however due to the enormous size of the hotel grounds it was quite a far distance to the pool from our room but we loved our stay regardless!
1,"My worst experience in Bali and Hyatt hotel. There were many mistakes done by the team and after giving feedback for many times, nothing is done by the Guest Experience Manager (Morissher Loduwijk) and his team. I have checked out for 2 weeks and my points and qualifying nights are not credited. I have stayed in many Hyatt properties globally but I will never return to this particular one. They took 30 minutes to get my invoice ready during checkout, asked me to checkout when it is not the time yet. Even more hilarious, they messaged me yesterday that my room is ready to check in when I don't have a reservation."
5,"Wonderful gardens, top-notch staff, done in traditional style of Balinese water palaces, which is just stunning.  Reasonable gym with a really nice adults only pool, if you aren't travelling with kids.  Lots of other nice pool areas if bringing along the littlies.  We always come back to this place."
3,"Disappointing. Having stayed there several times over the last 10 years, the service, food and facilities have significantly dropped in quality. Major communication issues, with hotel failing to provide advance notification of music festival affecting hotel guests with loud music till 11pm and restaurant closure of Salsa Verde. We experienced issues with food quality, regular run out of pool towels having to wait 30 mins or more each time, and food service issues at both Garden Cafe and Watergarden. On a good note, the service and food at the Japanese Restaurant Nampu was very good. The facilities especially rooms need an update. Sadly no longer a 5 star resort in my opinion."

4,"My wife and I finished our honeymoon with a week at the Grand Hyatt Bali. It was big and Grand, very friendly and clean... wonderful settings regardless if by the pool, at the beach or having a meal or cocktail later in the evening... one improvement would be to to have an area of the pool to be adults only (child free zone). Wonderful having ability to order food and drinks while in the pool. "
5,"Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua was truly a grand experience. It’s an older hotel, spread over a massive space, right on the beach, in a “gated” area of Nusa Dua. The entrance and lobby are grand scale and immaculate. The grounds, gardens and various koi ponds were beautifully kept. There are 5-6 different restaurants offering western options, along with Balinese fare. The Grand Club breakfast buffet was our personal favourite, in a stunning setting among the koi ponds. All staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, a special shout out to Urip in the Grand Bar, Augus in the Watercourt and “Friday” in the Garden Cafe. Suksma 🙏  I travelled with my elderly grandmother and we look forward to returning as soon as we can."
5,All staff were helpful kind and friendly.  Especially staff in the breakfast restaurant in the west village!  Suka was so beautiful.  Breakfast was a 10/10 every morning. So much choice and omelettes were made fresh in front of you. 
3,Staff could have been more helpful and better trained. Overpriced for what it was. Very long time to check in on a quiet afternoon. Would have been good to have a better explanation of facilities and induction material in the room.
5,"Our whole family loved our stay at grand Hyatt Bali. Breakfast spread was amazing, best kids club, pool and beach were nice, and staff was super accommodating. Thanks for such a wonderful stay, you will not regret staying here. "

5,"We recently returned from a 10-day vacation at the. Bali  Grand Hyatt. where we have been. going to this hotel. many times over a period of 20 years. The hotel on this occasion was probably as good as  gets  and the staff could not have been more helpful, amazing As very senior experienced travellers. we could not recommend it any more highly. A little disappointed to learn that two of its major restaurants were undergoing renovations. So Restaurant Choice was limited on this occasion.  Senior couples seeking. a quiet time should avoid school holidays. "
5,"The Hyatt although on the rather pricey side of accommodation rates in Bali is in a great location and staff went over and above to make our stay memorable. Breakfast was excellent and drinks reasonably priced. The only negative we found, was that the TV did not broadcast any of the sports channels that are available.  We found a nearby sports bar in another hotel resort, that we would go to so that we could watch the French Open which was on at the time we were in Bali.  This is a shame, as you would expect a hotel of this calibre to provide a streaming service."
4,"Great location across from some shops and near a Cafe strip. Right on beach which is very clean. Clean hotel, beautiful gardens. Pool is so nice! Staff were all friendly and went above and beyond. Buffet breakfast was delicious with many vegetarian options also. Wait staff Krisna and Ardana were excellent."
2,I am staying at this property with my family (including 10 adults and 3 kids) for the past 3 days and I would like to summarise our experience as absolutely abysmal. Since the time we checked in until now one or the other problem has troubled us. My brother rooms WC backed up on our first night and his bathroom was in a horrible state. The staff is not upto the standards of Hyatt  This size of the property is so big that they don't have enough staff to take care of the guests. I have just asked for a spare room key as I lost mine and it's really late and they sent 1 after 1 hr which didn't work. I don't know whether the staff is not equipped with the right kid of skills or just overworked. Stay here only if it's a free stay!! 
5,"The most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed in!! The staff were so friendly and accomodating, breakfast buffet had a wide range and the beach nearby was very peaceful. Also loved the pool area and the room was huge. Definitely coming back! :)"

4,Booked ocean view room 4 months ago. Got suite instead. It is bigger room with living room. But that’s not i wanted.  Next time should keep what customer wants. Not sell the room to higher price to different customers
3,"Clean and tidy hotel, great staff and plenty of restaurants to choose from. Room service was unacceptable though, over 90+ minute wait so we decided to cancel the order and go to sleep hungry. Breakfast buffet is worth it, but still not nice to go to bed hungry."
5,"One of the best hotel in Bali i believe. My  impression starts from the spacious room, even from the lowest type. This hotel also have a private beach. Some hotels also provide so, but Grand Hyatts private beach is one of the cozziest and cleanest beach. Next we try to have a dinner here and the foods are all delicious. Even qe can request a classical music to get along. Staying 2 nights with toddlers in Grand Hyatt is not an issue. Many activities with my kid.Grand Hyatt's kids club as well as the 3 different pools save parents day to make kids busy. The staffs are super friendly and helpfull.   If there is a thing to improve, i guess Grand Hyatt can provide a nearby toilets for pools and beach areas. They have a toilet but it is like we need to walk a bit further to reach.. …"
5,"This was our second visit to the Grand Hyatt Bali,… let me start by saying the staff at this resort are just so friendly , charming and helpful, probably the best we’ve ever encountered. Testament to this is the fact we met staff that have been there since the resort opened 30 odd years ago. We truely enjoyed chatting and laughing with them immensely.   The place is huge, with immaculate gardens that are lovingly cared for, it’s a pleasure just to walk around.  In some aspects, the Grand Hyatt is showing her age ; the beds need upgrading to 5 star standard, they are very firm ( that may suit some guests though ) and they are getting creaky. The entertainment systems in rooms definitely need renewing . In saying that, the overall charm of the property isnt affected by these…"
4,"Stayed here for two nights to kickstart our Bali trip, very big sprawling resort. However, its in dire need of room renovation. Staff attention was good. Nice breakfast. The mattress was really bad, pillow and duvet was lumpy. "

5,"We loved our 9 night Luxury Escapes holiday- fantastic value for money. The room was big and very clean. The staff were all lovely and friendly. Breakfast, lunch and dinner was included. You could eat lunch and dinner from 3 restaurants plus over the weekend a fourth restaurant was open. The menus were extensive and different at each venue. We did not have time to try all we wanted too. The quality of food was amazing- everything is made from scratch including the ice cream.  It was great to sit in the shade under the trees on the beach and around the pool is plenty of shade. The Bali Collection mall is directly opposite the resort.  We will very happily return again. Thank you to all the staff and to Luxury Escapes."
5,An amazing property despite some renovation ongoing. Good range of breakfast with international selection and excellent club lounge facilities. Helpful staff which gives good advice about nearby recreational options 
4,"The Grand Hyatt delivers on customer service and is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. However the whole property feels dated and old, it really needs an upgrade. Rooms are quite small as well. "
5,"2nd time at the resort after coming with the family a few years ago. In better condition this time. Breakfast is first class, rooms are comfortable and in good order. The grounds are massive and kept beautiful. Check in and check out was effortless. Coming back for sure"
5,"We deeply miss strolling on the nice beach and catching the breeze. Love the view from our spacious room and the care and help rendered to us throughout our stay with our 20-month old toddler. Grand Hyatt hires the best ppl, all hotel staff we met were friendly, considerate and helpful. Highly recommended for those with young children. "

Having stayed at over 20 different properties in Bali past 20 years I recommend Grand Hyatt Bali the most because of its staff would like to shout out auntie Suami and Sutrisna who have looked after us many times like family Thankyou everyone"
5,"Whilst every aspect of our stay from the wonderful suite to the comprehensive food and beverage and to the authentic warmth and attention we received from the Hotel teams far exceeded our expectations I need to call out the incredible experience/interactions with the Club Lounge team and in particular Anggi, Tri and Eka who anticipated our every requirement throughout our 10 day stay. We will definitely be back and looking to introduce additional family members and friends to this wonderful property."
5,"Spectacular lobby, beautiful gardens/water features/pathways to the rooms and amenities, and extensive pools. There were further additions being made to the pool areas while we were there, so I can only imagine that it will be even better than it already was. The pools were also just steps to the private beach. Please note that you may do quite a bit of walking to get from the lobby to your room; frankly, I did not mind that since it was a good way to walk off breakfast.  The food at the Garden Café for breakfast is diverse and delicious. Lots of opportunities to try the local cuisine. There was also plenty of Western food for the less adventurous.

2,The hotel facilities are great - big bedrooms which is perfect for young families. Pool and garden areas are so well kept and the property is huge. Food and beverages however are very average - menu is limited and the drinks are watered down. If you're looking for the true Balinese experience do not go here!
5,"Beautiful hotel in great location. Deserves its’ 5 stars for spacious rooms with lovely views - our garden view room overlooked a large water garden and had good privacy, too. The housekeeping is spotless and immaculately maintained. Staff here are absolutely fabulous- super friendly and helpful and it feels like they really enjoy their work.  A short golf buggy ride takes you to the local shopping area “The Bali Collection” with several known stores eg surfwear, Polo Ralph Lauren etc plus a mini department store with lots of clothing, sportswear, homewares, souvenirs, spas, dining etc. The Garden Cafe serves western, local and international dishes and the breakfast buffet is one of the best I’ve experienced anywhere.

We also loved the breakfast, so baby friendly. And the staffs are very friendly, fast response, and helpful. Definitely will come back with more days to stay. Thank you!"
5,"Family of 3, we had a WONDERFUL experience at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. Definitely recommend for kids!!  King bed SO comfortable Room cleaned EVERY morning beautifully  Staff super friendly and efficient  Lovely room facing Balinese Pool  AMAZING POOLS  AMAZING food and cocktails  BEAUTIFUL grounds and beach front  Kids Club was fantastic service !  Toddler room was great too, daughter loved it!  -We didn’t include breakfast which is big mistake as it is sooo expensive. They need bigger venue for breakfast as each time it is super busy. -Tv didn’t work properly, so for daughter was frustrating.  "

King bed SO comfortable Room cleaned EVERY morning beautifully  Staff super friendly and efficient  Lovely room facing Balinese Pool  AMAZING POOLS  AMAZING food and cocktails  BEAUTIFUL grounds and beach front  Kids Club was fantastic service !  Toddler room was great too, daughter loved it!  -We didn’t include breakfast which is big mistake as it is sooo expensive. They need bigger venue for breakfast as each time it is super busy. -Tv didn’t work properly, so for daughter was frustrating.  "
5,"Had best time at Grand Hyatt. Kids had very good time at the pool, and great ambience. Staff are very friendly . Very good place to stay for 3 nights and night foods stalls next to the beach is a very good experience"
5,"We stayed for training and the room was very clean, the breakfast was tasty, the staff was very warm, overall the food was super! I would come basck with my family to enjoy the resort. Thank you Grand Hyatt Bali"
5,"The resort was stunning! Our room was very spacious and the staff did amazing at keeping it clean. The hotel provided still water every day to the room and we did not get sick at all.   My daughter has various food allergies and she is anaphylactic to some of them. The staff members at all the restaurants special mention to the Garden Cafe went above and beyond to cater for her. They had new equipment and confirmed her allergies before every meal.  But most importantly, everyone in Bali was very polite and friendly. We had the best time! Is a very family oriented resort! The beach was beautiful and private.  We would love to go back in the soon future!"
3,"Food choices were limited, Indonesian food poor and generally Luke warm servings. We have stayed at the Legian, Samaya and many other Bali resorts, worst food here.  Ordered coffee at breakfast, had to ask for it three times before we got it. The table next to us had the same complaint. At the club breakfast area."
5,Stayed here for 4 days pre solar eclipse tour. Very nice luxurious accommodations.  Secure area with nearby shopping.  Great beach.  Staff is very accommodating and professional.  Rained so we’re not in the pool area. Partial under construction at the time of our visit but looked inviting 
5,"30 years since last trip to Nusa Dua and Grand Hyatt will ensure we are back next year. Excellent hotel with courteous friendly staff, good food and during ""dry season"" not to busy - but perfect weather. Good choices at various breakfast spots, specialty Teppanyaki restaurant was good (albeit a bit pricey) and across the road from resort is ""Bali collection"" of shops/ bars / restaurants. Resort is well maintained, with plenty of helpful staff, and Nusa Dua area has plenty of security personnel for safety.."

5,Gorgeous grounds.  Beautiful japanese-style bridges.  Amazing water features and Lilly ponds everywhere.  Beat beach--soft white powdery sand and thick mangrove trees that provides great shade and wonderful breezes from the ocean.  Best of all was the customer-focused staff that seemed so delighted to make every aspect of our stay.  Upgrade your room!  Well worth the investment!
5,"We stayed at Grand Hyatt with our two children, 5 & 8. It was perfect for us. The two different slides kept them happy for hours at a time and they also loved feeding the bunnies at kids club. It was a peaceful place and we were blown away by the beautiful grounds and also the beach out the front."
5,The place is quite huge with amazing pools. Some of them are suitable for small kids as well. The ambience is also wonderful. One flip side of such a large resort  is that any service to the room is a little slow. The buffet breakfast spread is also quite huge. 
5,Great place if your after a family vacation. The resort and beaches is well kept by great friendly staff who will go out there way to assist.  We stayed at the Ocean view room which had a great King sized bed.  The room is a little dated and I wouldn't use the daybed. On the outside is over looking the sea however as there is a public path way there are many guests passing so NO privacy.
5,"Blissful stay as always! Warm & welcoming staff, tending to & pre-empting all our needs. Special call out to Ari, Sutrisna, Urip & Miliana in the Grand Club. Perfect location on the beach + many pools, several restaurant choices, and things to do for all ages. Kriya Spa is heavenly (Kartini - amazing therapist). Have been a regular guest for over 20yrs."

4,"Very beautiful and big property directly on the beach. Be prepared to walk—have comfortable shoes. However, they provide transport from the lobby depending on the village you’re in. Walking is better! "
3,"This is I don’t know how many stays at this property and 3 in the previous 6 months. Nothing changes and feedback falls on deaf ears.   I’m tired of booking a King Room only to find out again and again it’s 2 single beds pushed together, not even held together by a zip. Just pushed together and dressed.   The Grand Club has turned into a cafe with management allowing children to run wild. You promote this as an executive area full of children.   I have communicated my feeling on prior visits and have been ignored.   I have given you enough chances and there are too many choices now just to skip Hyatt on my next visit.   It’s a pity the owning company can’t invest the revenue back into the property, nothing has changed and it’s now becoming a very tired property including ill…"
5,"We felt very welcomed by the staff all throughout the resort.   We loved the pool area it was  such a beautiful setting , surrounded by lush shady trees and overlooking the sparkling beach with white sands and blue waters. The very friendly and professional staff - in particular Pari , Wiria , Angga and Adi were amazing , going above and beyond to ensure we had an enjoyable and relaxing time.   We also enjoyed many meals at the Watercourt restaurant and hospitality of all the friendly staff - thank you Krisna and Wahu   Can’t wait to go back again !"
5,"Great place for vacation with your kids. Great place for rest, doin nothing, just calm and hear beach waves. This hotels has a large variety of facilities and also pool. You just feel like stay next of water-park. Your kids will love this."
5,"I have never had such a excellent hotel before, where just everything has been excellent. Great campus and architecture, large variation of activities and services and many restaurants with different food. "

5,"Our package was an ""all inclusive "" basis, and  we had no regrets!. Our stay from start to finish was superb ... From the grounds of the hotel , it's environ, the friendly / courteous and warm staff to the food  / drinks and cleanliness of the hotel was amazing !. It will be an understatement to  say the staff worked tirelessly to ensure that we had a fabulous experience.  They went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was memorable  I will definitely be back !!!!! Much love to the team ❤️ ❤️"
3,"The gardens and pools are what make the hotel. The rest is very average.  Our room wasn't ready until 25 minutes after check-in time and it was dirty! There was dust all around the tiled skirting board in the toilet and bathroom, there were toothpaste splatters on the bathroom mirror and tissue box and the mirrors were all smeared. I had to ask them to come and clean the room again. We returned to our room as he finished mopping and i was please to see it had been cleaned until I looked around and saw they hadn't cleaned any of the things I'd told them were dirty. Clearly the young cleaning staff have a routine and don't clean anything else, which is why it had weeks of dust build up on it. I cleaned it myself.  I booked for a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 children. The room was…"
5,"So fabulous to take the holiday which we planned pre-COVID. Grand Hyatt Bali is like returning to family❤️.  Gardens are gorgeous, rooms are good and staff make you feel welcome. The restaurants on site suit our requirements but we look forward to Salsa Verde reopening too  "
3,Limited restaurants open to use vouchers. Iwould avoid voucher deals. Staff were exceptionally friendly and responsive.Rooms were slightly dated. Great garden views. Very large resort to navigate.we found there were 4 to 5 pools of wich all but the main pool was attracting use.

3,"Overall very good. Grounds are amazing, staff are amazing, restaurants were great except choice of wines was limited. I think the hotel could really benefit from a high end steakhouse or steak and seafood.  I found mysel craving a decent steak while I was there. Hotel needs work on the small stuff like a socket for the kettle “close to” the tea and coffee stand, needs USB ports either side of bed, hooks for bathrobe and should consider golf buggies for the elderly. The property is vast, and can be challenging walk if your of a certain age. "
4,"We just stayed a week at the Grand Hyatt - the pool is fantastic, our 4 year old daughter absolutely loved the pools and slides. The gardens and grounds are really beautiful and our room - Delux Ocean View room - was great. The downfall, unfortunately, is the food. By day 3, we were sick of the poolside menu which is really limited. The room service menu is also quite short. But it was the quality of the food that was not up to mark... We paid for an all-inclusive deal, and didn't eat elsewhere, so really felt the repetitiveness of the food and so wished it was better - if the food was great, we'd be back for sure!"
4,The resort is beautiful and has a very balinese atmosphere. Staff always friendly and smiling. We loved the pools and beachfront. They also have rooms were kids can play when is too hot outside. Recommend!
5,"First time in Bali, enjoyed a Club Executive Suite at Grand Hyatt and the Suite, Hotel, Staff and facilities were first class!!    Suite, Food, Facilities, space, location, and attentive staff are virtually perfect if you want a getaway 'with the lot'!!  We'll be finding a way to go back as soon as we can!! "

5,"My first stay at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. I have a toddler and my elderly parents with me. This hotel is safe for both small kids and elderly parents.  The garden and the ground is well kept and beautiful with a lot of trees that keep us cool from the hot sun.  The pools are big, so many of them, so it was never crowded with people in one spot. The room is comfortable, a but outdated but clean and feels like home. The restaurants are great too. They have 4  restaurants for breakfast  so we tried different restaurant each day (my fav one is the Waterfront). Staff are very pleasant, polite, attentive. Also, Bali Collection is just in front of the hotel. We definitely will be back to Grand Hyatt."
3,"Overall beautiful property, wonderful landscaping, great people. We stayed in a club room, and loved the room, afternoon drinks and service. The big downfall for us was the fact that club pool was occupied by very young and very loud kids all the time, which ruined the whole experience. Management allows it, but, since the pool is small, it feels very wrong. "
5,"Beautiful resorts with good service and of course good food! No matter you came for business trip, you may experiences different vibe with clean beach to give more relaxing after meeting agenda. And with great food served, it was perfect!"
2,"Booked this in august last year for a week in Club. The day we arrived the club was closed for the week, no one advised us of this, their makeshift alternative was terrible, as loyal Hyatt members we felt so let down, we moved to the The Laguna just down the road, it was superb."
5,"Fantastic time at the Grand Hyatt , our room was great and staff were very friendly. The food was perfect and the menu was very diverse.  Cleanness of the whole hotel was excellent. The beach was great along with the pool."

4,"The hotel is in a lovely part of Bali - somewhat secluded with access to a broad stretch of beach that is well maintained and regularly checked and cleaned. The hotel grounds are beautiful with some great facilities, plenty of areas to relax around the pools that are well catered to by friendly staff. There's good food and if you want something different there is a shopping complex just across the road with massage, gift shopping and lots of restaurants. The only downside for me is the rooms and room decor is tired. Some of the amenities don't work and there's a lot of inconsistency with tv size, reception quality if that's important to you.  Internet wireless worked reasonably well throughout our stay (1 week). The staff are lovely, always friendly and attentive. Would I go…"
3,"This is a very large, expansive hotel & with that brings many guests & many staff. This makes for an impersonal service holiday.  We booked a club room many months before our stay & 2 days prior to arrival we were informed the club would be closed during our stay. The Club, the Italian Restaurant & Bar were all closed during our stay.  The room was small.  The chemicals used in the pool made our bathers & goggles discolor."
5,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 8 nights and loved every moment of our holiday!  My 7-year old daughter loved the pools, especially the rocky pool. We used the kids club a couple of times - the activities were interesting and staff - very friendly. The beach was nice too - the low tide in the afternoon is a good time to explore the rock pools.  Our room was in the North village - very convenient to all the amenities. The resort is huge and is so beautiful - the gardens, the ponds are well maintained.  The food quality is really good, although lunch and dinner menus are essentially the same. All staff are very friendly, helpful and make the guests feel at home.  We are looking forward to returning to this wonderful resort again."
4,This resort is excellent for both young and older family.  It has a lot of to do thing to do for the kids and older adults.   The con side of my first experience was the cleanliness of the room is below my expectation.   It has also luck of other customer necessity.
5,"Great resort to go with the family. It has four restaurants to choose from, excellent pool for adults and kids, kids club, shows, a spa, small market, photo studio and excellent food. Also close by there is a shopping centre. "

4,"Old hotel but  beautiful. Huge property so you rarely feel crowded. It’s like staying inside a botanical garden. Staff were extremely friend with special mention to Mr Ari (pool restaurant manager). The only downside to the experience is that the room smells old and musty (we think its coming from the old fabric in the daybed). I think it needs some deep cleaning. Otherwise, no other complaints."
3,"Food and beverage was great, service was great but the maintenance on the pools was pour. They really need to put some time into the pools to make sure they are safe for everyone. Myself, my daughter and a little boy all had cuts from the pool surface or broken tiles. It is not good enough & needs to be seriously looked at. 8 stitches on holiday from a resort pool - No excuses. "
4,"Fantastic Location. However the beach in front of the hotel was not very clean. There was plenty of debris, used plastic bottles, bags, etc swept in by the tides from the river close by. Grand Hyatt should pay more attention to cleaning the beach front as this is a main attraction for guest like me and my family and could ruin an otherwise great holiday experience "
5,"1   Very nice five star hotel. All the facilities are old  but management was   very good and superb.  Ambience is very nice. Design of the hotel is traditional. Staff is also very helpful and friendly  espexially Eni  manager was  so kind  and  excellent They are always ready to offer service and support.  Food is also very nice, the quality of the food is excellent and everyone will enjoy it.  there  are  so  many  restaurant  in  the  hotel ( balinese ,japanese  ,international  etc )  They are also ready to serve you customized food if requested. All 4 swimming pools are well maintained.  Even one of them has a long slide facility.  was  so  funny  If I come to Bali again, I will definitely stay here again.  thanks    "
4,"Stayed for 2 nights on May 2023, the staffs are all friendly and helpful. Great facilities inside the hotel area. We also got complimented photo and video services from Bojue Photo. The Breakfast foods are great!"

5,"We only spent a week here but they made us feel like valued customers from day 1, from the gardener to the pool staff, everyone took the time to acknowledge you as you moved about this stunning resort.  Yes the rooms are a little dated and there was some construction going on but they are working on that discreetly and it didn't detract from our stay at all.  A number of restaurants were avail to choose from with different offerings, the pool just went on forever with lots of separate oases dotted here and there, and although at 75% Occupancy while we were there it felt more like 50%. It was not crowded at all. The Grand Club concept was well worth it, with a special area for club members to chill and dine extras included - definitely consider this. The facilities had everything…"
2,"We've booked 2 nights at Grand Hyatt Hotel , we are a family of 5, and we booked 2 ocean view rooms. At check in receptionist tells us , that ocean view are full , not available for us. But why? we are traveling from Italy, we've managed our trip by the agency, and we have a receipt of 2 ocean view rooms booked. why they didn't hold them for us? we sill dont know .  However, they give us an upgrade room : 1 suite for 3 and 1 ocean view. The problem was that the suite is arrange for 2 person and if we didn't call 2-3 time reception desk no one comes to arrange the third bed for us.  Once the housekeeper came, he tried to arrange the 3rd bed on the sofa with a mattress of maximum 7 cm, we had a little argument and he arrange a bed in the middle of the living room without any kind…"
5,Wowzers!!! This property is exceptional. We stayed for a special occasion and staff and hotel were excellent. The hotel is enormous and has beautiful rooms and grounds. The rooms were clean and the food was delicious.Would definitely stay again! 
4,This was our second stay at Grand Hyatt Bali. Overall the resort is amazing beautiful gardens and fantastic pools . The location is great as well situated right on the beach in Nusa Dua . This resort is ideal for families with kids . The Grand club staff are very friendly and accommodating  the grand Club itself is a little sanctuary nestled in this huge resort.Only 1 thing has changed since our last visit and that is the food options. There great pool side restaurant was being renovated. Which was not a issue the issue was that the replacement for this was a tent with 4 hot food options near the beach that never changed during our entire 5 days there. Also you would think if you close your Italian restaurant for renovations you would substitute the other food options that would…
3,We had giant cockroaches in room. Ants in the bed. Toilet was blocked gad to call maintenance and they worked on it fir hour to unblock . Toilet leaked all on bathroom floor. Restaurants were good so is the pool area and beach. Overall was average considering high class resort…
5,"We only spent a week here but they made us feel like valued customers from day 1, from the gardener to the pool staff, everyone took the time to acknowledge you as you moved about this stunning resort.  Yes the rooms are a little dated and there was some construction going on but they are working on that discreetly and it didn't detract from our stay at all.  A number of restaurants were avail to choose from with different offerings, the pool just went on forever with lots of separate oases dotted here and there, and although at 75% Occupancy while we were there it felt more like 50%. It was not crowded at all. The Grand Club concept was well worth it, with a special area for club members to chill and dine extras included - definitely consider this. The facilities had everything…"
2,"We've booked 2 nights at Grand Hyatt Hotel , we are a family of 5, and we booked 2 ocean view rooms. At check in receptionist tells us , that ocean view are full , not available for us. But why? we are traveling from Italy, we've managed our trip by the agency, and we have a receipt of 2 ocean view rooms booked. why they didn't hold them for us? we sill dont know .  However, they give us an upgrade room : 1 suite for 3 and 1 ocean view. The problem was that the suite is arrange for 2 person and if we didn't call 2-3 time reception desk no one comes to arrange the third bed for us.

5,"We had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali with our two young children who were delighted throughout our trip. The hotel is situated in a peaceful area and offers a range of well-maintained facilities. Our spacious room comfortably accommodated two adults and two children and was impeccably clean. The professional staff provided excellent service, and we enjoyed a hassle-free trip to the Ulutua temple to see the Ketcha dance. We ended our trip with a two-night stay in Ubud, and we believe this was a great decision. We highly recommend the Grand Hyatt Bali to family travelers looking for a relaxing and luxurious experience at reasonable rates"
5,The Grand Hyatt Hotel in Bali is a very pleasant surprise.  It is spaciously  positioned in a magnificent garden of 41 acres in all.  Showcasing  Balinese architecture and sculpture.  The hotel accommodation is well appointed within the gardens and very comfortable.  There are many different dining options to choose from in the Resort and we enjoyed our dining experiences.  The Resort is on the shoreline and we went down to the Beach Shack each afternoon to enjoy the ocean breeze coming in over the IndianOcean.  We have had a memorable holiday here and will return with certainty.
5,"I really enjoyed my Luxury Escapes package - room and food were great! Staff were warm and helpful. Could ask for extra bottled water no problems. I had the burramundi at Garden Cafe twice, it was So Good. Nusa Dua was welcome escape from the bustle of the rest of Bali, but far from usual attractions like Ubud. Bali collection shopping is just across the road, but not a place to get bargain prices. Did catch covid on last day though, but from venturing outside the hotel! No Bali belly from ice or food in the hotel itself."
5,Terrific resort with beautiful grounds and spacious rooms. The resort was well maintained and had plenty of food options. Pity the Italian restaurant was closed during our stay. perfect beach front location and excellent morning walks in the area. 
5,"The staff, the gardens and the rooms are all delightful.  Love this resort and the peaceful beauty of the Grand Club is not matched anywhere else in Nusa Dua.  Kriya Spa is gorgeous and the treatments excellent.  Definitely will go again."

5,Exelent Resort Would like to visit again if I get a chance.I visited almost all the four restuarants their service was par exelent.Food was great.Specialy the service at Daily bar was great.At Daily bar one of the srever Dayubi was very swift service and always smiling.God bless her
5,We are here now on a Luxury Escapes deal and we are having the best time.  Our room 3447 is so clean and quite large with a lovely view over a well manicured Balinese inspired garden.  Very quiet and tranquil  sipping bubbles on the terrace.  Norman Sutarsa...well he cannot be praised enough for making sure we have everything we need in the room.  Right down to ice delivered promptly at 5pm each day for balcony drinks and organised flowers to make us feel special.  The food is plentiful delicious and generous.  So many choices and thank goodness there is an awesome gym.  Every member of the team here is exceptional helpful thoughtful kind friendly smiles always and everywhere.

5,"Our one week stay at the Grand Hyatt was exceptional on every level - superior service, food quality and facilities across the entire resort.   Beautiful Nusa Dua location - picture-postcard beach with plenty of shady trees for lounging and an inviting expanse of pristine blue water.   We had buffet breakfast at the Grand Club overlooking green gardens and pond with bird life, ducks and koi fish, even the occasional visit from a large water dragon with an appetite for bacon. The service was attentive, friendly and professional - every morning.   We had lunch and dinner mostly at the Garden Cafe where the diverse menu offers great options for both casual dining and something a bit more. There’s Indonesian favourites like Gado-gado and chicken satays, and a range of Italian pasta…"
5,"This hotel is one of the favorites for hotels in Bali. They have so many pools: main pool, grand club pool, Balinese feature pool. It is very convenience for swimming and sun bathing. Also the breakfast experience is very enjoyable for my family. The food variations and taste is very good. 1 thing need to consider is vehicle parking to be more closer to the hotel lobby. Room is also very enjoyable and convenience, thank you so much that they upgrade my room to the executive suite, which is very spacious and comfortable. Anyway, me and my family have a very enjoyable and unforgettable experience staying at Grand Hyatt Bali. Thank you so much for all the staffs and managements of Grand Hyatt Bali..."

5,"The best resort with the best facility and super friendly staffs in ITDC area.  They offer great price, especially if you’re Hyatt member during high season compared to thr other 5 stars resort.   You’ll have 5 different places for breakfast during your stay and a wide variety of food and beverages on those places, so you don’t have to worry about queuing for breakfast."
5,"My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt at Nusa Dusa. we had the best  experience. The food was excellent with a variety to chose from, the staff  were very helpful and answered  always with a smile on their face and there was nothing that was a task for  them. The room was clean, ample and with a beautiful  view of the ocean. We cannot find anything that is at fault. Will recommend to anyone whom is planning their trip to Bali oh and I forgot the gardens were amazing to look at and brought peace and serenity. "
4,"Huge resort in the Nusa Dua hotel zone. Staff is really good, service is splendid and well kept grounds. The property is old, however maintained okay. We stayed in a club room with club access - They really make an effort to give you everything and if you wanted you could satisfy your hunger and surely thirst here. And wen entering the room we were met with a personalized letter describing club offerings etc. The resort is really big, and is inside this gated Nusa Dua zone together with all the other resorts - Some would say too polished others like it."
5,"The resort situated in a very good location, beautiful beach views and a lot activities. Massive pool area with lots of kids activities and friendly staffs, the kids loved the place.  One thing had to say the resort is too big, had to walk really long distances in between places, hard for kids growing out of pram but not able to walk for really long distance. And the resort is not Asian friendly,  if you got western face, all good, if you got Asian look, don’t chose it!"
5,"it s getting hot start from even 8am, we spent most our time in the pool.  Thanks for the fruit in the room, this is the first time I try salak the snake fruit.  Also hyatt is very close to the two island (nusa dua)."

I would definitely come back as this was the best resort I have stayed at in six visits to Bali. The Garden Cafe's staff were all amazing, as was Krishna at the Watercourt. "
4,"Beautiful resort with native trees and wild animals  Staff is absolutely amazing from reception, housekeeping, kids club and waitresses. Breakfast was fantastic however lunch and dinner a bit repetitive after a few days "
5,"A luxury hotel with a true Balinese ambience feel throughout the resort. Catered for the whole family with the choice of restaurants, pools to lounge at and places to explore nearby such as the Bali Collection shopping precinct. All the staff were genuinely helpful and friendly. We hope to book again in the future."
5,"We have been staying at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua since 1992. This visit we stayed in an executive suite in the South Village which I highly recommend.  The staff at the hotel are personable, efficient and helpful. Make sure you have the afternoon tea, it is fantastic."
5,"A memorable & extraordinary experience, the stuff dreamy family holidays are made of! Impeccable customer service from the entire team. Special mention to Wahyu, Tria, Muylan, Ari, Mudita, Agung, Agus , Adi & Wijaya. Spacious rooms meant there was  plenty of room for everyone, while the kids clubs, restaurants and pools are all at your fingertips. A Balinese massage from the expert therapists at the Kriya Spa is a must. Filled with a wonderful array of experiences ranging from a beach bonfire experience to Hi Tea & a weekly list of fun activities for guests. Peaceful, pampering, cool but unpretentious: Grand Hyatt Bali is the essence of what a tropical Balinese paradise should be . "

2,"The property is huge, the grounds & lobby are well maintained & outstanding. Some pros: - Nice pool areas; friendly servers, albeit extremely slow service. - We had a king club suite & an interconnecting twin room in the east village. The rooms were large & very well appointment with everything we needed. But, see cons below. - The Grand Club was excellent; the staff was kind & attentive. The food during the breakfast & the drinks/snacks during the happy hour were very good. - The dinner staff the Garden Cafe restaurant were very kind; they even made my little one pasts well after they had closed.

1,"I have stayed in many Hyatt and other luxury hotels around the world, including this one for ou honeymoon some  25 years ago. Then, it was faultless, but sadly it is now nothing but a decaying husk of the hotel we remembered. Sadly, in anticipation of the fine dining we experienced previously, I made the mistake of booking full board, possibly the worst decision I have ever made for a holiday. Every restaurant on the site (those that are open) offers the same very average food choice. The exact same menu at lunch and diner time. So, staying 14 nights that equates to 28 meal choices from a menu that I would struggle to make 2 satisfactory meal choices from. The food quality is churned out 2/3 star quality, but on reflection, that probably ties in very well with the current…"
5,Super clean resort and room. Room had  2 queen beds plus a day bed that could sleep one adult or 2 children.  Upgraded to an ocean view room and well worth it. Exemplary food and service. Stayed  for 7 nights and could’ve stayed 7 more. Will be back xxx
4,"The Grand Hyatt is a luxury hotel and you realise that from the moment you arrive, where a team of people are ready to open doors, take your bags and even bang a welcome gong for you. The staff are absolutely delightful and every single one of them greets you  whenever you encounter them.  We stayed in a room in the North Village with a "" garden view"", The garden was actually a pond full of lilies and wildlife, including two monitor lizards who could be seen basking on rocks or swimming across the pond.   The Room The room was spacious and spotless. We did have an issue with the shower being blocked when we arrived which led to the bathroom being flooded a couple of times before it was fixed, but other than that we had no problems.

5,"Stayed for a week with 3 kids. Good range of dining options, Lunch from 11.30 and dinner from 5.30 which helps with tired, hungry kids, although service /food could be slow at times. We had a suite with interconnecting twin room which was lovely for space and had a lounge and dining table. Abit dated, not ultra modern. Kids loved the waterslide and beautiful beach. Kids club has a great range of activities and the gorgeous bunnies were a hit with our kids. Kids club staff were fantastic and very friendly. Huge resort with lovely grounds.   "
4,"After almost 3 years of pandemic, lots of hotels and resort were struggling, some managed to keep it intact and well-maintained. Grand Hyatt is definitely one of the one successfully maintained.

5,"This resort is well established, it knows what it is doing and has been doing it well for a while. It is a pleasure to walk amongst the old growth trees to the many facilities. The staff are a real pleasure and the food is great! There is a dedicated kids club with lots of caring staff to look after the kids. The older style rooms are large and comfortable but you can hear other guests easily, especially if the are on the other side of the adjoining door.  "

5,This hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff are amazing. It is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed at. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Bali and look forward to returning soon!
4,"We came on a luxury escapes deal which is a great value package with all meals included, cocktails and spa massage. It is clear that the hotel is starting to date especially with 3 years of COVID so I understand there some shortfalls in the upkeep of rooms (lack of ventilation in bathroom which made the room quite humid, room and decor is starting to date and some creaky furniture). However, the staff really try hard to make your stay pleasant - they provide exceptional service, always greet and help you, good food and plenty of options with the holiday package. It is great venue for families but if you like a bit of extra luxury, personalised service and attention to every detail then you need to pay a bit more for the exclusive resorts."
1,"Possibly the worst hotel experience I have ever had. We should have known there was going to be issues when we checked in and a gentleman was arguing with the reception staff about the quality of the room.  As we walked to the room, there was another lady who was yelling at the bell boy to get the front desk staff to her room because her room was unacceptable.  The hotel was completely booked out, which meant there was no room around the pool for anybody unless you got to the pool at 8 am.  The staff at the pool was slow, and we had to go and ask them for drinks and food rather than them offering it to us that you would expect in a five star hotel.

5,"Beautiful surroundings, great food and just the friendliest and helpful of staff. We were here for a holiday and loved our entire 8 nights. Could have easily stayed longer. Conveniently located across the road from Bali Collection shopping village. A must stay. "
5,This hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff are amazing. It is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed at. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Bali and look forward to returning soon!
4,"We came on a luxury escapes deal which is a great value package with all meals included, cocktails and spa massage. It is clear that the hotel is starting to date especially with 3 years of COVID so I understand there some shortfalls in the upkeep of rooms (lack of ventilation in bathroom which made the room quite humid, room and decor is starting to date and some creaky furniture). However, the staff really try hard to make your stay pleasant - they provide exceptional service, always greet and help you, good food and plenty of options with the holiday package. It is great venue for families but if you like a bit of extra luxury, personalised service and attention to every detail then you need to pay a bit more for the exclusive resorts."
1,"Possibly the worst hotel experience I have ever had. We should have known there was going to be issues when we checked in and a gentleman was arguing with the reception staff about the quality of the room.  As we walked to the room, there was another lady who was yelling at the bell boy to get the front desk staff to her room because her room was unacceptable.  The hotel was completely booked out, which meant there was no room around the pool for anybody unless you got to the pool at 8 am.  The staff at the pool was slow, and we had to go and ask them for drinks and food rather than them offering it to us that you would expect in a five star hotel.  I ventured down for breakfast, and again was most disappointed with most of the food that should’ve been warm, was cold .  Needless…"
5,"Absolutely amazing.... upon our arrival, we were greeted by such warm, lovely staff on reception.  The grounds were absolutely stunning, my husband and I were wowed upon first impressions and they did not stop there.  Our room was stunning, private, clean, spacious, welcoming with a fresh pot of flowers.  The comfort of the bed did not disappoint, beautiful views of a  peaceful lake filled with fish and gorgeous, colourful flowers - just could not fault a single aspect.  The staff too, were amazing.  Highly accommodating, friendly, polite, keen and willing to please.  In particular, I would personally like to thank Surya, Neza, Wahyu P. for treating us with the utmost respect and affability.  Each and every member of staff within the hotel displayed a high level of training…"
5,The Grand Hyatt is the ideal location for a family vacation right on the beach with an excellent swimming pool. The facilities and food options are outstanding and the staff are absolutely amazing. The perfect place to unwind and relax.
4,"Loved the place overall.  The staff are so friendly, the facilities are clean, the pool area is fantastic (our kids loved it!), my only very small wish is that I wish they would sell cider.  I don’t drink beer, and having cider choices (e.g. Magners, Bulmers, Strongbow etc.) would have made this a perfect 5 star place for me.   I’m sure that Bali is missing a trick not selling ciders in more places, lots of people don’t drink beer…."
5,"Excellent facilities, good selection of restaurants and wide variety of activities. The hotel staff were very friendly. Enjoyed the Club Lounge, the gym and all of the pools. Sampled food from all restaurants. location in Nusa Dua is great."
4,"Beautiful hotel. Staff are warm and friendly, but the service is  VERY slow in the restaurants and bars. The pool bar staff are the exception and move at a faster pace, and the food and service at Nampu was excellent Food has been delicious at all restaurants. There is a good selection at the buffet breakfast, although it gets a bit chaotic. Coffees can take 30 minutes to arrive, so order as soon as you sit down. Portion sizes at Garden cafe are a good size, however, they come out as they are ready. One night we had one person on entree, another on main and another finishing dessert!. When we visited Veranda Lounge, a cocktail can take 20 minutes to arrive, despite it being almost empty. Speed of service is the only thing I can fault. Despite this, we had a lovely stay."

4,"The place is in a separate secluded area from the city. So forget ay chance of seeing night markets etc.  This is ideal for a kids' vacation with lot of kids activities and pool and restaurants.  They were not so organized on sharing resort activity info, so be proactive in seeking it out. "
1,Please think twice about this hotel beach is all but closed due to government works .Hotel going through major renovation constant noise that you cant escape.Food every day cold even after asking for it to be replaced still cold .Please look else where as the works will be going for quite a few more months  
2,"Currently staying at the Grand Hyatt and I must say that the service is the most disappointing we have experienced in Bali in the 10 visits we have made here.   We paid extra for the Club access and it’s been the worst that Bali has to offer! Breakfast here is chaos with a wait of 15 - 45 minutes to be asked if you would like a coffee, 5 deeps queue for eggs to be cooked.  This is our final night here and we have just arrived at the club lounge to be told that there are no tables  and that we have to hang around like hobos waiting for service. Disgusting!!   10 visits to Bali and we have always stayed the Conrad, this is the first time at the Grand Hyatt and if this is 5 star then the Conrad must be 8 stars because I wouldn’t class this any higher than 3 star.   A suggestion for…"
5,Just got home after a ten night stay. Absolutely loved every minute of our stay. Went with our 4 year old would definitely recommend!!  Staff were amazing and the grounds are beautiful. Good selection of restaurants even with one closed. First time in Bali & loved this resort. 
5,"As expected, Grand Hyatt Bali is a wonderful resort. Even with the construction at the beach and the restaurant, Salsa Verde, the attentive of the staff more than makes up for it. Rooms are nice n big albeit a little dated. However, the amenities and the house keeping are top notch! "

The pool areas were amazing perfect for relaxing surrounded by lovely gardens.  Excellent service from all Pool Bar staff . A special mention and gratitude to Pariyatna (Pari) for the attentive service. Going out of his way to make sure   we were  happy and taken care of. Suksma🙏 Several restaurants  that served wonderful food and plenty of options. Our favourite was Garden Cafe for the pleasant atmosphere ,great food and service. Suni and all staff members were amazing and helpful. Thank you for looking after us and catering for my dietary needs. Gluten free options.  For quick shopping  Bali…"
5,"40 acres of mature landscaped gardens and water features around four accommodation wings, restaurants, spa and other guest services. We had a grand king suite in the club wing, close to the club lounge serving breakfast, evening drinks and nibbles and all day refreshments. Surrounded by water pools with huge gold fish and water birds, the lounge is a relaxing place to sit and chat or rest. Breakfast also served in the Garden Cafe restaurant, and breakfast choices/quality very good. Nampu Japanese restaurant and Watercourt Indonesian restaurants were our favourites. Several swimming pools to choose from, and play areas for kids. Our suite was spacious, with very comfy bed. This older hotel is being lovingly maintained, and Italian restaurant Salsa Verde was closed for upgrade.…"
3,"The Grand Hyatt is massive and probably excellent for families. But the resort is showing it’s age, the beds are uncomfortable and hard, room service is limited and poor and having clear maintenance occurring outside from 8.40 to 10pm was not great after a long haul flight. "
5,"It's a huge 5-star property!! We had an amazing stay at the hotel. Our room was huge with a lotus pond and birds chirping in the morning. The hotel entrance is a big surprise!!! One gets greeted by vast ocean. The surroundings are so peaceful that one can hear waves early in the morning and nights. Beach is pristine clean, and one can see the surface. The hotel has a huge swimming pool and caters to all age groups. For morning walkers, the hotel and nusa dua offer a lot of spaces. A huge thanks to F&B team for accommodating our request for boxed breakfast early in the morning. The breakfast spread is delicious, healthy, and yummy. The housekeeping guys are highly responsive to the needs. Overall, it was a wonderful stay!!! We would recommend anytime."
5,"My family and i had an amazing time at grand Hyatt, my children enjoyed all day at the pool with the slides and my husband and i had the most relaxing time, definitely coming back! We had access to the special aperitif room included in our price, that was the icing on the cake!"

5,"This Hotel is truly excellent. From the  Location with it's beautiful beach and well laid out gardens  It is heavenly. What makes this place extra special is the staff, each and every one of them are brilliant. Especially  Nadia. Kevin, Adi and Kartika (hope I've spelt it right)  If you are planning to visit. You have to try the beef burgers at the pool bar. Not to be missed.  Herself when to the fitness centre and found the staff very helpful and friendly and the classes were excellent.  I would highly recommend the omelette for breakfast  Amazing. The rooms are big and bright, lots of space and and the guys that do the housekeeping do a great job. So yes I would have no worries about returning to this Hotel "
3,"We have been staying at the GHB over many years, we love the style and location. For this trip we booked a Club Deluxe room. Unfortunately our room, whilst well located for pools and the Club, was so old and ordinary. It’s probably the most underwhelming room we have ever stayed in during our many stays at the hotel. On the plus side the food and service in the Club was brilliant. All F&B outlets that were open were good. We particularly loved the Watercourt restaurant which served Indonesian dishes. If you’re around the pool the GadoGado salad was so tasty and filling, good value for the price. Our family was also staying and loved the kids club and kids pool. The gym is outstanding, the best of any hotel we’ve stayed at. Staff overall friendly and helpful. "
5,From the first contact we found the staff extremely pleasant and helpful. The rooms were very clean and well maintained. The choice of several restaurants gave variety for dining and the meals were delicious. The pool and beach are clean and again well maintained. We had a really nice holiday and would certainly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay again.
5,"A great way to get a ""taste"" of Bali with typical Grand Hyatt comfort.  Situated in Nusa Dua, a relaxed, clean and safe environment not too far away from the hussle of downtown Legian, Ubud and Seminyak if you felt like adventuring.  Resort was what you would expect from Grand Hyatt, although rather large. Rooms were spacious and well maintained. Attention to detail and customer service was great.  While there was some renovation to restuarants during our stay we still had choice and great meals.  Pool was vast and plenty of space while the beach is clean and free from any hassle."
5,"This resort is Outstanding . Absolutely beautiful surrounds. Staff amazing. The beach is very beautiful and water clean and good to swim in.Make sure you visit Bali Collection across the road, plenty of shops, restaurants and massages available "

Pasar Sengol was a magical experience for our family.  Wilma at Camp Hyatt is a five-star employee, and I am convinced she is not getting paid half as much as she deserves... she always goes the extra distance and makes my daughter feel safe and happy.

5,"When I wrote this review, just finished our holiday staying at grand hyatt nusa dua and apurva kempinski nusa dua.  I could easily tell that grand hyatt nusa dua bested almost all aspect from other hotel.  The pool. There is always lifeguard at the slide. There is also staff scattered around all the pool. Make me easier to order something to drink or eat.  The food and drink. The taste are fantastic, the portion are generous, the price are reasonable for 5 star hotel. Nasi bali set at watercourt are fantastic. The dinner experice at nampu japanese restaurant also nice.  The staff. All the staff are helpfull, always smile, always greet us whenever see us. Even the senior older looking staff are know how to interact to my 6 and 5 years old son.  Definetly will come back again  "
5,"We had an amazing stay at Grand Hyatt for four nights during Nyepi. We booked a Nyepi package which was discounted and also included dinner on Nyepi. The property is huge and it had something for everyone including my two year old who could visit the Toddler play area and she loved her time in the toddler pool which featured a waterfall. The beach was clean and perfect for young kids during low tide. Right across from the property is Bali Collection which had several shops and restaurants. Everyone was really nice and it was indeed a relaxing holiday, would love to come back."
5,"We went here during Nyepi Holiday and it was superb happy and well done, start check in very smooth, we got an upgrade to the club room and access, thank you for that, although we know the rooms is full during that. The hotel is big, and the pool with the slide and cave were very nice, check out on club lounge also very smooth without any hassle. We surely will come back in the next future. "
2,"The room I booked was the grand king deluxe.  Unfortunately, our king bed was made of two twins put together which was extremely disappointing and uncomfortable.  Our room was less than par and did not meet our expectations.  This hotel was located in the 5 star resort and base on room condition itself was clearly not.  "

1,On our final day at Grand Hyatt my laptop was dropped and broken by a member of the housekeeping staff. I immediately reported it and I was reassured that an investigation would occur within 24 hours and I would receive an email the next day. Of course days went by with zero outreach from Grand Hyatt or their management. I finally sent an email to them (as it is nearly impossible to get through by telephone) and I received a reply several days later that they had conducted their “investigation” and found that their staff had not damaged my laptop. No explanation of how my laptop went from in perfect condition to very clearly being dropped while we were in Ubud for the day.   I sent follow up emails and attempted to contact them via phone and have received no reply. I’m…
1,"After check-in, we had to change our rooms twice because they smelt of mould (unclean AC filters) This process required us to speak to 8 different people and took up our afternoon.   There was no complimentary drinks or anything offered, or even an apology, we were made to feel it was our fault.  There is loud renovations happening on a large restaurant close to the main pool.  This they never revealed to us this was happening when we booked.    On our last day, we discovered (by chance) that this day was the start of Nyepi/Ramadan.  This mean roads would be closed throughout the island for the festival and most people (drivers) would not be working.  This sent us into a panic about how we would get to the airport for our 11pm flight.   We decided to leave early and get a hotel…"
3,Beware Salsa verde restaurant is closed for renovations. There’s only one restaurant that can be open for every day. Therefore the menu becomes very mundane. Another restaurant is open one day a week. The buffet and show is only on Saturday night. We had Luxury Escape vouchers and was very limiting. 
5,"My first stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali was thirty years ago, and to this day it remains the highest quality resort on the island. From beginning to end, everything is first class. I was there with my brother and it was his first trip to southeast Asia. He had the best travel experience of his life, and he has traveled throughout the world. I would recommend this property to anyone."
5,I will be booking again there. I will recommend hotel to family & friends  The area was perfect & felt safe & secure there. The food was excellent and no upset Bali tummies. Prices were reasonable and staff very friendly. No issues

5,"We spent six nights in the executive club suite at the Grand Hyatt at Nusa  Dua. We are very spoiled by all staff in the lounge, particularly Urip, , Suarni & sherwani. Although it wouldn’t matter if I knew their names as everyone there was exceptionally kind and generous looking after my dad, who is 87 and myself. We absolutely loved it. I haven’t been there for over 20 years and will definitely be back. We came on Luxury Escape and I look forward to doing that again!!"
5,Great beach and wonderful staff. The check in and check out was very efficient. Rooms were clean and services was very prompt. The business meeting rooms were well maintained and dinner organized food was excellent 
5,I could write so many amazing things about this hotel! I’ll keep it short.  The staff are exceptional. Any staff will go above and beyond to make you happy. We traveled with two kids and not one staff would ever walk by without saying hi to our girls or asking how are day was.  The pools are perfect. So many places to lounge and the water slides are a blast.  We had a suite and it was huge! Two bathrooms and a great layout for families. We enjoyed the balcony often.  I highly recommend this resort! 
5,"Enjoyed 9 nights of luxury at the Hyatt Nusa Dua.  The facilities were excellent and we were pleasantly surprised by the extensive gym facilities.  Enjoyed several massages and treatments at the Kriya spa.  The club lounge was excellent value, food options were extensive and tasty.  "

Although it wouldn’t matter if I knew their names as everyone there was exceptionally kind and generous looking after my dad, who is 87 and myself. We absolutely loved it. I haven’t been there for over 20 years and will definitely be back. We came on Luxury Escape and I look forward to doing that again!!"
5,Great beach and wonderful staff. The check in and check out was very efficient. Rooms were clean and services was very prompt. The business meeting rooms were well maintained and dinner organized food was excellent 
5,I could write so many amazing things about this hotel! I’ll keep it short.  The staff are exceptional. Any staff will go above and beyond to make you happy. We traveled with two kids and not one staff would ever walk by without saying hi to our girls or asking how are day was.  The pools are perfect. So many places to lounge and the water slides are a blast.  We had a suite and it was huge! Two bathrooms and a great layout for families. We enjoyed the balcony often.  I highly recommend this resort! 
5,"Enjoyed 9 nights of luxury at the Hyatt Nusa Dua.  The facilities were excellent and we were pleasantly surprised by the extensive gym facilities.  Enjoyed several massages and treatments at the Kriya spa.  The club lounge was excellent value, food options were extensive and tasty.  "
5,"On our first trip to Bali we close the GH as we have stayed in other Hyatts around the world. Bali did not disappoint. The staff were just wonderful: polite, gentle, caring, smiling - they made the holiday for us.  Sure, there are a few things that could be brought up to date but if you want glitz and chrome try another hotel. If you want friendly service, comfortable beds and impeccable housekeeping, then look no further that this hotel.  The downside for us was the shortage of restaurants available. One was being renovated and on other nights they were booked for private conferences which were happening at the hotel. Such a pity."
5,"I want to keep this very simple. We stayed 5 nights, upgraded to Grand Club, king size garden room. We haven't regretted one moment. The staff are all, and I mean all, polite, cheerful and so so helpful. A very special mention to Suarni in the Club lounge. She is so hard working and polite. She feels like a friend. Thanks Grand Hyatt, for everything."
5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali is such a great place to stay in Bali. From the service to the food to the pool to the beach to the gardens around the hotel, it really feels like you are somewhere special. Great for kids also with the kids club, water slide and other activities. A big shout out to one of the staff members Toya who always make our trip extra special"
4,Beautiful hotel. Great for kids. Huge territory. Big rooms. Awsome service. Slightely overpriced for the in hotel service. I'll be comming back. Love it.  Nice environment near beach service was great  One of the best hotels in Bali! Excellent location and excellent service! Impressive welcome to the hotel. Large private beach
5,"During our 3rd day of amazing stay at Grand Hyatt Bali we had a thought, let’s have a look if there’s any bad reviews about this hotel. I was surprised what I read…. I’ll tell you what, I think I might stop reading reviews from now before we go anywhere,  as bad reviews about this hotel must be done either by sick people 😅 or competitors.   The hotel is absolutely stunning! The pools, the room, restaurants - the lot. Staff always helpful and very polite and smiley. I can’t fault one thing about his hotel, we loved every minute spent there. The location is amazing (comparing to other hotels we stayed in Bali)  Paying a bit extra for a club was a good thing which I read about on trip advisor previous reviews. For a little extra than just B&b you have happy hour for drinks as well…"

5,"My husband and I just finished a week at the Grand Hyatt Bali. This is a beautiful, sprawling resort with lots of nice pools and a terrific white sand beach.  As Hyatt Globalist members, we were welcomed at the entrance and led to an air-conditioned reception area. It was a super luxurious start to our stay.  We loved the service at the Grand Hyatt. Several employees greeted me by name around the property!  Our status gave us a large room with a huge bathroom in a special part of the hotel. This area had its own peaceful pool (kids allowed). It was a few steps outside of our patio.  We also had access to the lounge with our status. This meant a lovely open-air breakfast (til 10:30A) and cocktails from 5-7p. Lots of finger food and crudite available and we made it a meal most…"
3,We took 2 rooms with club access. Happy with the room size although  looks quite old. When I read reviews before my trip a lot of people seem to compliment the food. I find the food in this hotel rather average. Most of the staff are lovely. Kids had a great time at the beach and pool and even took surfing lessons. What I find odd is that they don’t provide water at the poolside. We had to purchase a bottle of water. From past experience 5 star hotels usually provide water at the poolside.
5,"Everything about Grand Hyatt Bali is excellent! My husband and I stayed for 7 nights and the hotel and staff exceeded our expectations on all aspects especially daily breakfast! Would strongly recommend it if you're after a superb holiday, we'll be back."
4,"Just had a grand time at the Grand Hyatt!  The site is sprawling with many gardens and varied pools, one including a fun water slide. The roaming ducks were enjoyable to watch from our ocean view balcony too.  The gym was first class and the opportunity to hire bikes a great break from eating and lounging by the pools.  The room, although large, lacked items I would think necessary these days, eg usb ports, coffee machine and chrome cast TV but was comfortable non the less.  Although not all restaurants were open, the choice of food was great and with the Bali Collection shopping centre across the road we weren’t lacking for options.   The highlight of the stay has to be the staff who were all so lovely and welcoming. From the reception staff to pool staff, restaurant to grounds…"
2,"It’s off peak season, so understandably the hotel is completing some maintenance. However this really impacted our stay. We stayed for 8 nights and on a fair few nights we only had 2 restaurants to choose from to eat throughout the day. We didn’t know this until the day. All of the signs around the hotel advise the restaurants are open everyday. This is not true and periodically they close for multiple days. When asking the reception why it was closed they would just advise that it was only open Wednesday-Sunday, like we should have known that?   There is loud construction by the pool too and the slide is closed half the time. If you ask them to open it they will do so for about 20 minutes then close it again.  Overall pretty disappointing experience if you have the luxury…"

5,"Just spent 7 days at Grand Hyatt Bali and have to say it was fantastic, the hotel, the staff, the food and  the amenities were excellent. Would highly recommend this beautiful hotel and we will be back for sure."
5,The view when we first arrived at the resort was absolute paradise! Traditional Balinese dancers greeted us in the lobby were there is a spectacular view of the beach and sky just beyond the garden foliage. Restaurants and bar with a very nice view of the manicured grounds and beach. Staff are really nice and lovely. Overall our stay at the Grand Hyatt Hotel Resort was an experience of a lifetime. You have to go there and enjoy the experience in person. I will miss it and the friends I made there at international restaurant and the great staff members who made our stay a pleasure.
5,Stay one night during our short vacation to Bali island. The property has been around for sometimes but their maintenance was good and the room and property was clean. Good breakfast and it was perfect stayed for us. Would definitely recommend to stay here
2,"Stayed 2 night at Grand Hyatt Bali. We weren't very impressed with this Grand Hyatt thinking we have checked in to the wrong hotel. We have been to many Grand Hyatt and Park Hyatt, this one is really a let down.  Please allow me to start with a positive elements of the hotel.  The Garden & Landscape in Grand Hyatt Bali is very nice, matured, manicured lawn and many ponds and streams with wildlife abounds in this manmade habitats.   There are many pools as well in this resort. A landscape pool with slides, an Adult only pool at the Gym area, a Balinese pool and a Grand Club pool catered to Club stayers only.  There are many deck chairs available throughout the resort. You will sure to find your favourite spot within the resort.  The Service is very typical Hyatt standard and it…"

4,"We were there for our kick off meeting last week.  The customer service experience is excellent.   On day 1 upon check in, we were almost past the lunch hours in the WaterCourt Cafe.  The duty manager told us not to worry.  He had informed his team to extend the lunch hours for us.    While waiting for our food, a waiter volunteered himself to take group picture for us.   Experienced similar good customer service in other cafes (eg Garden Cafe)  throughout the entire week of stay in Grand Hyatt Bali.   Thanks so much. If the sound proofing in the hotel room can be further enhanced, I will give a 5 star in my next visit should the customer service standard maintains  - Eric from Singapore"
5,"First time back in Bali after covid and it was sad to see the effects it had on the island. One thing that hadn't changed was the Grand Hyatt and fantastic service and facilities it always offers, particularly the Grand Club. We had a wonderful stay and our thanks to Urip and the rest of his team."
5,"We stayed in Grand Hyatt Bali with our Family and we were amazed by warm welcome of their staff on each area.Friendly and very helpful.Great Food and presentation,Clean Room and Bathroom.Hotel facilities and lots of activities you can do.Beautiful swimming pool near the beautiful beach.We had amazing help from Front Staff Ode Dwipayana,with his help to decide which room suite us as a family and thankfully with his amazing knowledge and professionalism made our stay memorable.Thank you"
5,"This was our second time staying at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. The use of open spaces and greenery together with the friendly and helpful staff make this our favourite hotel there. We stayed in the Club area and could not fault the service.  If you're in the Club lounge, look out for Jessica and Suarni  (hope the spelling is right) who are always welcoming and always helpful. Assistant Manager Sutrisna is a fantastic guy who seems to be everywhere at once with a personal greeting for every guest.  The teams at Housekeeping, reception, and concierge were all great. We were in Bali for a relaxing time and the hotel (and staff) made this happen for us."
5,"As a retired couple, we have stayed at the GH Nusa Dua several times and always book a club room as we enjoy a less crowded hotel wing and the high service level offered in the Grand Cafe including the separate pool for Club wing. Having had an illness recently I felt I could relax and recover at the hotel, which I did.  The beach area is also one of the best in Nusa Dua sheltered by the headland. The hotel is an older hotel but exceptionally maintained, no long walks to restaurants, pools or beach. Food is great and breakfasts in the Cafe offer a wide variety of quality options as its the evening drinks in the Cafe. We are looking forward to our next stay in July / August."

5,It’s all about luxury and you will enjoy! Grand Hyatt is a must stay if you are visiting Bali. Amazing hospitality and property. You will enjoy the calmness and services offered. Nice big swimming pool’s and the beach side ocean view room will make your soul happy.
5,"We have just had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt on a LE package for 8 days in an Ocean view room. The LE package which gave us full board and an evening drink was really great value. As for the hotel we were very impressed with our room, the beautiful grounds and gardens, the massive pool and the restaurants. Unfortunately the Italian restaurant was closed for renovation but we ate at all of the other three. Teppanyaki at the Nampu was a particular standout. We will certainly return."
5,"We had a great time in Hyatt, staff very friendly and helpful, breakfast ,lunch,dinner amazing, we had free breakfast , lunch and dinner everyday we stay Hyatt  Room very big and very clean  We had private swimming pool but little boring that why we spend Time and enjoy with peoples another swimming pool . Will be back soon"
5,We stayed in Grand Hyatt for ten days with a kid. Swimming pool was great. Staff members were nice and kind. Especially housekeeping staff was the highlight. They went extra miles such as adding a bedding to the day sofa. One down side of this hotel is hard to get out of the hotel. I wish there is a shuttle service.
5,"Great facilities, restaurants and staff.  I’ve stayed or visited all the hotels beach side in nusa Dua and this one is the best. Beach front access and boat to nusa Dua reefs right there.  Gym has squat rack, free weights also to 60 lb dumbbells, cable machine, various machines and a smith machine.  Usual cardio treadmills and steppers etc.  kids will love the pools. Awesome gardens and vegetation management - serene.  No plastic bottles - all glass refills.  Well done Hyatt!!!!"

Nice swimming pools and water slides, kids loved it. Staffs were welcoming, attentive and helpful. Gym was spacious, clean and in very good condition. There were enough activities in the resort to keep us and kids entertained. Breakfast was nice, offer lots of choices. Garden Cafe and Watercourt serve ample portions of delicious food. Nampu on the other hand was a bit below average in terms of the food portions and food quality."
5,"Having spent 4 nights in Singapore we flew to Bali to the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua . Landed in the evening in the rain . 15 min car ride to hotel . Check in was quick , room was ready and our luggage put in room . Escorted to room so we didn’t get lost .  Had a drink in the lobby to end the evening.  Got lost walking back but not a problem soon found out and asked the way . Following day was cloudy , humid and warm . Breakfast great , nothing to fault . Staff so friendly and helpful. Plenty of everything and an extensive selection of food . Had a great wander around . Yes a large resort but that’s good . Plenty of walking and exploring the grounds , lots of greenery , ponds , plants . Great beach .  Was worried about getting an upset stomach here in Bali , but was just cautious…"

5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali is located in the guard-gated Nusa Dua resort area of Bali. I am a Globalist member, used point redemption for 4-nights and received compliment upgrade to a Grand Suite.

Separate bath and shower, with 2 sinks. We were in the North tower and our 2 adjoining balconies had the view of a huge koi pond.  Bottles of drinking water were given and replenished daily.

3,Stayed for 1 week.  3rd time we have stayed at nusa dua but first time at grand hyatt.  Let me first start with the biggest disappointment. The breakfast. Utterly let down. Smallest buffet spread i have seen in a 5 star hotel let alone one with 500+ rooms. Rooms are old school on the dated side but that ok.  The only thing that was a positive is the staff and the pool. One of the restuarunts Salsa verde closed for renovations. Not sure if this makes a difference. A bit disappointed.

3,"Hotel and staff are great. Restaurant offer is substandard for a hotel like this. From menu options to ingredients, these do not track the expectation the hotel and the restaurants set. This is with exception of Watercourt."
3,I found the Grand Hyatt to be overpriced and expensive. Breakfast Buffett was poor standard. Overall not a great experience. Bali holiday at Australia prices. The staff were friendly. No mini bar offered 
5,"Beautiful, large resort in Nusa Dua about 20 mins from the airport. We booked a suite and it was huge, with a canopy bed. Beds and pillows were extremely comfortable, and service was excellent. If you have club access, you can have breakfast at any of the restaurants. Highly recommend their Saturday night balinese buffet and performance at Punggol, the outdoor restaurant/ampitheater. The kids club is open and the 1st 2 hrs are complimentary. Some vendors will approach you when you’re on the beach but they’re mostly nice and not super pushy. We had a great stay."
4,"Was great experience in our stay , only issue was the insects in the room. Bar fridge was empty and I visited other hotels and bar fridge always filled with drinks and other things, hotel staff was very friendly and helpful , only improvement should be pickup and drop off from the airport should be provided and do something on insects in the room."
5,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 night during a 2 week vacation in Bali.  What a great experience this stay was for us.  As a Hyatt Globalist, we used a suite upgrade and we're offered a Grand Suite King on the 4th floor of the North Building.  This location was perfect for access to the Grand Club Lounge breakfast and afternoon drinks and snack time.  We also had a slight ocean view from our room.  The suite had a reading nook and a large balcony overlooking the gardens.  The Grand Club pool was perfect for us as we prefer a quieter pool experience.   The beach was close by and so much fun as you can walk out quite a distance during low tide and still only be in waist deep water.  The Grand Club Lounge breakfast food was well above average for a buffet style meal and the service…"

5,"Beautiful, large resort in Nusa Dua about 20 mins from the airport. We booked a suite and it was huge, with a canopy bed. Beds and pillows were extremely comfortable, and service was excellent. If you have club access, you can have breakfast at any of the restaurants. Highly recommend their Saturday night balinese buffet and performance at Punggol, the outdoor restaurant/ampitheater. The kids club is open and the 1st 2 hrs are complimentary. Some vendors will approach you when you’re on the beach but they’re mostly nice and not super pushy. We had a great stay."
4,"Was great experience in our stay , only issue was the insects in the room. Bar fridge was empty and I visited other hotels and bar fridge always filled with drinks and other things, hotel staff was very friendly and helpful , only improvement should be pickup and drop off from the airport should be provided and do something on insects in the room."
5,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 night during a 2 week vacation in Bali.  What a great experience this stay was for us.  As a Hyatt Globalist, we used a suite upgrade and we're offered a Grand Suite King on the 4th floor of the North Building.  This location was perfect for access to the Grand Club Lounge breakfast and afternoon drinks and snack time.  We also had a slight ocean view from our room.  The suite had a reading nook and a large balcony overlooking the gardens.  The Grand Club pool was perfect for us as we prefer a quieter pool experience.   The beach was close by and so much fun as you can walk out quite a distance during low tide and still only be in waist deep water.  The Grand Club Lounge breakfast food was well above average for a buffet style meal and the service…"
5,Amazing property. Super huge property that has everything inside the compound. Relaxing place would be in the beach. A highly recommended place for family vacation for a week. Kudos to all team of breakfast and an amazing food from the restaurants.
5,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt (19/11/2022 - 26/11/2022) in the Family Interconnecting Rooms (grand rooms).  Normally we stay at another large all inclusive resort in Tanjung Benoa however thought we would mix it up and try the Grand Hyatt. We were not disappointed and had an amazing trip. The rooms were comfortable and spacious. The pool was HUGE and countless hours were spent lounging poolside whilst the kids played. Surya Merta from the Pool Bar took great care of us whilst we were there ensuring we had plenty to eat and drink. He is a great asset to the resort. All staff were extremely kind, from the young chap checking us in on arrival, through to the FnB staff and house keeping. We will definitely return to the Grand Hyatt for a future Bali holiday."
3,"We are a family of 6 with 4 teenagers and stayed at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua for 7 days. There is good and bad with this hotel. The good - lovely staff who are very polite and accommodating, large resort with beautiful grounds, 4 restaurants (one was closed for renovations while we were there however), beach front position, clean beach (unlike other areas of Bali such as Seminyak or Legian which were full of washed up plastics), large resort pools and very safe and secure like a private gated estate. There is also lovely shade trees on the beach and around the pools if you want to get out of the sun.  The bad - money talks loudest in Bali. We booked our accommodation 8 months ago and all was confirmed. A few days before our departure however Grand Hyatt contacted us to say our…"
4,Biggest hotel I ever stay I think. Pool are good enjoy it. Beach is beautiful. Rooms are large size bathrooms are perfect. Breakfast was poor not much choose. Lobby and restaurant was very welcoming.  Reception must show all hotels.you meh gat lost.
4,"We stayed for a week over the Christmas / New Year period and had a fantastic time! The hotel is absolutely enormous and we thought the facilities were great - The pools were amazing, we chose a different spot every day and our son loved it. Waterslides were good for the older kids.   The grounds are also beautifully landscaped with plenty of grass spaces for kids to run around, and the beach in front of the hotel is beautifully maintained - It was the nicest and cleanest of all the beaches we saw during our trip to Bali.  We ate at the hotel quite a bit and most of the restaurants were quite good - Garden Cafe was our favourite for both service and the food. Room service was tasty but menu a bit limited. Pool and beach bar service was good on certain days, and lacking staffing…"

2,Hotel seemed understaffed compared to number of guests. Did not get our rooms well beyond check in time of 3pm. Other people in our party got rooms at 6pm. Hand towels not in room. Had to remind twice before we got them. Some other requests were not answered until after several reminders. Far below expectations from the Hyatt. Will not stay again here.
5,"Perfect holiday in hyatt nusa dua, the service, huge pool, great breaksfast everything is good and also clean and amazing private beach.. we will back again of course.. hyatt nusa dua is the first choice for us if we visit bali"
5,"Customer service is great. Hotel staff are all super friendly. Hotel facility is top of the chart, even though some of the rooms need some rehabilitation. Kids love the pool and beach. We booked a garden view room, but got a ocean view one instead. We couldn’t be happier. "
4,"I really enjoyed staying here as the grounds are stunning and spacious, the location is excellent and it has a wide range of facilities for children. However if you a really looking for 5 star experience with all the bells and whistles then this is not the place. The property is getting tired with things breaking here and there and the rooms could use a referb, but on the plus side, at least they are spacious. Service was very erratic and even disorganized at times, but all staff were friendly and gave their best effort during the busy peak season. In the end we had a great stay. The club lounge really added a lot of value and would like to thank the staff there for their hard work even though they missed and messed up quite a few orders lol.   "
1,"Room service response was terrible, we waited 2 hours for room service to deliver pizza and that is if you are lucky to get someone on the phone. The cleaning staff always forgot something e.g towels, water, paper, bath kit etc. Hotel was understaffed so you have to chase them around if you need something especially around the pool"

4,"Overall our stay was very comfortable, staff were very welcoming and responsive. Resort facilities were excellent and great for kids especially the private beach, pools and kids club. Restaurant food was good especially the Indonesian food but limited options for vegans and food was not labelled as vegetarian or vegan although staff were courteous in advising us appropriately. I think there should be more vegetarian and vegan options. E.g. at the verandah bar, they should have had vegan cakes and pastries. Even when we requested for this in advance, staff told us it was not possible. Room was very clean but the fridge and safety locker were not working and staff did not attend to it when we requested them to fix it. In saying all this, overall we really enjoyed this trip and…"
4,"Big spacious room (with Club access, paid extra), good local & intl food, great hotel facilities, fab beach with direct access, good e-concierge and travel desk. Strictly “no” glass policy around the pool shld be implemented. Ie., draft Bintang served in plastic glass. Staff always helpful and nothing is ever too much to ask, albeit few minor service issues can be improved. The World is short staffed - a big thank you to all the staff showing up everyday, rain or shine, to give us a warm smile and make our holiday a memorable one. We are certainly coming back! Terimakasi!"
3,"The property was nice as it was strategically located in Nusa Dua, Bali. Given that it is a five-star establishment, some of the amenities and the establishment itself would need a refreshment/revamping in my opinion. The staff was nice and friendly, and the resort works well for a young family experience"
5,"We had high expectations for our stay and this place didn't let us down. We loved it overall and would highly recommend this hotel to anybody, who is looking for a luxury resort for relaxation. We had a grand access and the room with open sea view. It is definitely worth of extra investment. Japanese restaurant was our favorite and we enjoyed having a Teppanyaki there during the new years eve.   "
3,"Hotel is outdated, rooms need a update. Capacity restaurants and sunbeds is not enough. You need to patient when ordering a cup of tea at breakfast or a drink on the beach. We arrived at 14.00h and had to wait until 17.00h for our rooms. After a 24hrs trip this is a very unpleasant surprise."

3,"We have stayed in other resorts previously in Nusa Dua including on this trip. There is a reason this is a category 1 Hyatt hotel (ie the lowest). The chain has given up on the hotel. While I have sympathy that this is a huge hotel with massive grounds needing many staff to run (plus the pandemic), unfortunately the hotel is past its used by date and the poorly trained staff make it worse. Ambivalence and going through the motions would be the best way to describe staff.  Pros: - huge grounds - good location for Bali collection  - decent beach for young kids  Cons: - room not ready until 6pm - ironically, next day telling me I couldn't have an extra hour (despite Hyatt elite status) because another guest was checking in early  - staff refusing to put in a roller bed in the…"
1,"We arrived at night and stepped in broken glass on the bathroom plus a lot of other stuff. Bad cleaning. No coffee or tea, lots of ants on the terasse, no bathrobes, hardly any water coming out of the shower, and everything just very worn out all over the hotel.  Beach chairs were old and crooked, loooooong wait for drinks at the beach, because everything had to be fetched at the pool bar.  We only stayed two nights so wouldn’t want to change rooms, but when we complained, after a long time, they offered us free breakfast. 15 min before the buffet closed down. And we couldn’t even take it the next day instead as ‘it was today we had the problem, and it would be fixed for tomorrow’ I have never experienced such inflexible service, and we are extremely disappointed in such a large…"
5,"We had a 5 night stay with our two older teens. The staff made sure that our rooms were adjacent to each other; the rooms were immaculate and spacious with very comfortable beds. The hotel gardens are absolutely beautiful and one of the reasibs that we chose this hotel. It exceeded our expectations. Every single member of staff is friendly and welcoming, ensuring thst we felt comfortable and safe the entire time. We would recommend this for a peaceful, relaxing holiday. "
1,"Although a nice standard of room and fairly good grounds the lack of staff, organisation between them has really spoiled it. The phone from the room for room service, ice or even just to ask a question has automatically gone to hold music 100% of the time. Not once being answered until you wait a while. Ordering food and drinks by the pool was a very slow and frustrating experience. Just trying to get a kids portable bed setup that they offered/suggested the day before was a half day journey and was quite simply chaotic with multiple calls, each person having no idea about it and different people ringing to see if it was done and hours later the doorbell rings saying there here to preppare  the bed that was already done and had my child sleeping on it. After the 8 previous…"
2,I had written a bad report on GH Bali just last week and need to emphasize more on this property as it's very very disappointing being such a beautiful property having such a wonderful space and child friendly we have had problems from check in up to checkout - it's unbelievably bad !!! On another note today the checkout line was 30 mins wait and people having kids were getting annoyed as kids crying and running around  Our checkout was unbelievable as we got print out of other people's invoice not ours to pay thanks god we were alert and demanded for our rooms invoices  There are trees so so low in height that so many taller people coming out of the pool were banging their heads  I hope that the GM of grand Hyatt could pay some attention to what's happening in the hotel and the…

3,"This resort should NOT be a 5 star resort rating. Rooms are due for renovations. The wardrobe is so old.  The staff and service are definitely not a 5 star, could pass 2 or 3 star. They need proper training.  Food is ok. The pool needs major cleaning.  Kids club is great. All the ladies minding the kids were lovely. The private beach is amazing. "
5,Very nice hotel around sanur area. Will definitely coming back. Good interior. Huge room and also very good Restaurant . I will recommend to my family in Sydney to stay here when they visit Bali next month 
4,"We enjoyed our stay. Our room wasn't available until about 5pm, though, and we weren't advised that it would take this long to prepare the room. On checkout, we asked for someone to take our luggage to the front, but they didn't show up so we took the bags ourselves. Everything else about the resort is magnificent. Just don't expect 5-star treatment here."
5,"Stayed at the Tamblingan Villa at the Grand Hyatt for a family Christmas gathering. We have stayed at this Hyatt on a number of previous occasions. As always, the staff were the stand-out feature - always extremely helpful. The range of dining options is impressive and we love using The on-site squash courts. "
5,"Last December, it was our first time staying at the Grand Club Room Grand Hyatt. Everything is very good.  although not a new hotel, but the maintenance is very good. They have a day bed sofa which is enough to be used as a bed for the child. We really like the Club Room facilities provided.  Outdoor lounge facilities and afternoon cocktails with good taste of food.  We also like the swimming pool Club Room which is not big but very comfortable.  Mr. Urip and Ms. Vinny in the Club Lounge is very friendly and very helpful.  We really like the atmosphere of this very spacious hotel with many choices of swimming pools and restaurants inside. Keep always maintain comfort and cleanliness. We really want to come back to stay at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua."

5,Great location . Great service.  Lovely food and overall stay experience. The club benefits make it even better. So would recommend for travellers looking for a relaxing and satisfying holiday experience in a natural environment.  Worth it!
2,"Very very underwhelming so far. Checked in today, or at least tried to. Arrived at 11am and room promised by 1pm….430pm and we were still waiting for our rooms.  Finally got our two interconnecting room as we are travelling with three kids (in West Wing….code name for far reaches of the moon 10 minutes walk from main restaurants and pools). We requested multiple times ground floor over grass so the kids could run around but they put us in kids rooms over a mosquito lake which is unsafe for our kids to go outside on the balcony for fear of falling in.  One of the kids bedrooms had not had one of the beds made up so we requested it be done at 430pm. It is now 830pm and still waiting with the four year old climbing up the wall after our 4am flight.  Would love to contact reception…"
3,"We stayed here for 5 nights with family, at the Ambassador Suite + connecting room. The room itself is GREAT - double showers, HUGE bathtub, large living/dining room, spacious balcony. But that's as far as a positive review goes.   Service is average if not poor. We encountered issues at the check-in. To hopefully address these hiccups at the beginning of our stay, I contacted the Communications Office Whatsapp channel (where the response rate for restaurant reservations have consistently been slow if not followed up on at all) but I didn't hear back anyone for duration of our stay.  There's generally a lack of care from the staff. We showed up to a spa appointment 45 minutes early hoping to use the spa facilities, but were told that the saunas and jacuzzis were actually back at…"
2,"There are lots of faults that we have found in this hotel property, as compared to years ago ! we generally expected GH Bali to be the same or even better than years ago but unfortunately we found this hotel to be one of the worst experiences we had in resorts.. Long waits for all restaurants for breakfast Room service between 30/45mins waiting time  Toilet amenities are very poor  Rooms are good and clean  Staff are very polite though some of them cannot resolve your problems in the hotel"
4,"Though this is an old hotel but all of the condition is superbly well maintained and the staff are very experienced, friendly and warm heartedly caring.. just mind that the hotel indeed occupies a quite large area.. be ready to walk around a bit.."

5,"A memorable stay at this fabulous resort.  We thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance, the food, accomodation but foremost the excellent interactions with very friendly and helpful staff.  Febyan Arum, the guest experience team leader, is an absolute standout.  Brilliant and extremely helpful.  We praise Febyan for her excellent insights about places to visit and other welcome suggestions."
4,"Great room, good food, staff are very friendly. Hotel area is very huge, very recommended to have dinner at the hotel because they perform Balinese dance show, beautiful and clean beach. The staffs are very friendly and helpfull. "
3,"PROS  Lovely old resort with gorgeous grounds, in a central location and within walking distance to shops. Five great swimming pools. The staff are attentive and do a very good job. The food is quite good and well-priced. Cleanliness of the rooms is of a good standard.  CONS The beds are quite hard and probably amongst the worst hotel beds we have ever slept in. The 'Club Lounge' is just an open area restaurant with no cooling. For us, this was a huge disappointment because we like to escape the hot midday sun by reading or having coffee in a cool Lounge. The Club Lounge also has very dirty/sticky, bacteria laden place mats on tables that seem never to be cleaned. It would be better to not have place mats at all, if they are not regularly cleaned."
3,"The Grand Hyatt is lovely - but a very loud night club/resort has set up next door and is very, VERY loud and operates very, VERY late. The staff are very helpful - we needed a doctor (for conjunctivitus) and the on site medical centre was a great relief."

3,"PROS  Lovely old resort with gorgeous grounds, in a central location and within walking distance to shops. Five great swimming pools. The staff are attentive and do a very good job. The food is quite good and well-priced. Cleanliness of the rooms is of a good standard.  CONS The beds are quite hard and probably amongst the worst hotel beds we have ever slept in. The 'Club Lounge' is just an open area restaurant with no cooling. For us, this was a huge disappointment because we like to escape the hot midday sun by reading or having coffee in a cool Lounge. The Club Lounge also has very dirty/sticky, bacteria laden place mats on tables that seem never to be cleaned. It would be better to not have place mats at all, if they are not regularly cleaned."
3,"The Grand Hyatt is lovely - but a very loud night club/resort has set up next door and is very, VERY loud and operates very, VERY late. The staff are very helpful - we needed a doctor (for conjunctivitus) and the on site medical centre was a great relief."
4,Stay at Grand Hyatt was pleasant and facilities were good albeit certain parts of the hotel looked old. Refurbishment required. Room was clean but TV not working properly. Food at the restaurants were great. Beach was beautiful and quiet.
1,Poor hospitality the staff at the property is super arrogant and non helpful i am staying at this property for the past 2 days and the worst experience I’ve ever had at Hyatt group property  we were sitting by the pool and I asked for the most basic thing “ DRNKING WATER” and staff replied laughing at my face that we don’t serve water. Surprisingly for group as renowned as Hyatt HOSPITALITY and COURTEOUSY are the basic things a guest expects.
2,"We went to Bali for a Holiday as a family. Before we stayed at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua, we stayed at Hyatt Regency Sanur. What a total opposite experience we had between the two hotels!!! I chose to move to this hotel on the 7th day of our stay in Bali because my friend highly recommended it. She stayed there as a family, numerous times, and always had a memorable time there. We booked the Grand Room as we thought the standard room was good enough for us to sleep for 3 nights. When we got to the room, my daughter was excited because there was a day bed on the side and she could sleep there by herself, but later we found there were many ants around the day bed. We also found ants around the sink in the bathroom. The furniture smelled and were actually old. So, I told them about the…"
5,"What a great stay!  a suitable place for honeymoon, spending time with my beloved one  Thank you for giving a sweet impression with a special surprise. Do appreciated for all of staff, we felt like we were at home. Outstanding service from the staff  ( Special thanks to Mr Ode  and Sutarsa for our Lovely suite al, delicious food ( Club lounge is Chill ) Thanks pak Sutrisna , ibu Suarni the ambience of the hotel make us wants to stay longger. will coming back ."
5,"Perfectly situated - pristine and undisturbed private beach, 5 awesome restaurants and bars catering to diverse needs with different but equally alluring ambiance, 4 beautiful pools, excellent service and very comfortable and luxurious accommodations. The Bali Collection Centre is just across the road, which is another big plus. "

5,"The hotel property is beautiful and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We loved the variety of pools. We had access to the executive lounge which offers a great tranquil setting for breakfast and evening drinks. It is a secluded resort, like others in Nusa Dua, so you have to take a taxi to outside restaurants or shops, although they have several on site. Rooms were comfortable. Do not leave any food out on your table because it will be covered with tiny ants.  One strange thing was early morning the water on the beach receded so far that you could walk out over 100 meters on dry land where the same area was available to swim by early afternoon. We spent our time in the pools instead."
3,"The rooms are clean and neat. In room wifi sometomes may not stable. There are many shops, as well as a money changer office of a national bank. Breakfast variety need to be improved. Hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful."
5,An outstanding hotel! The food in all the restaurants was superb!  The beach was amazing and the rooms and pool area was always very clean. Nothing was ever too much trouble for the staff. They were extremely welcoming and helpful. A special mention for Aui who always served us at breakfast at the Garden Cafe with a lovely smile and hot cappuccino! Odi and Bagas from Salsa Verde were brilliant and always made sure my husband and I were happy with our drinks and meal. In fact all staff at the hotel were exceptional as was the service! This was our second visit to this hotel and the experience was even better than the first! We hope to return to this hotel next year as we enjoyed it so much! Thank you to all the staff for a wonderful holiday!
4,staff are very attentive and friendly.Kids like the swimming pool very much.kids club program also well planned.breakfast and dinner at club lunges are very nice also.will consider to stay again in futher
5,Really nice resort. It’s like a huge garden. Very suitable for family with kids. It has several pools and some with water slides. We tried all the restaurants at the hotel. Everyone was impressive.  All the staff were so friendly and helpful.  The spa was really nice too. The only thing can improve is the bathroom. Bathroom is a bit small to my liking. Some renovation would be ideal.

5,Second time at this hotel.Its even better now. The staff are a major asset in particularly in the restraints and poolside.You are always met with a happy smile. The hotel is on a large acreage.So bit of a walk though good exercise. Food in restaurants was lovely and well priced. A lovely large beach area with plenty of space and loungers.You are never crowded. breakfast is lovely and service is amazing. Shall be returning.
5,"By far the best service from friendly welcoming staff who absolutely go out of their way to ensure your stay is the best regardless of the reason you are there.    Was blown away by how welcome you are made to feel and the genuineness of the staff when they are able to provide that service for you.  The room sizes are large compared to similar room types in other hotels which only enhances you feeling at home.  We are so impressed, we booked again for 3 weeks, just a few days after our last stay! "
4,"The staff are helpful and friendly, the hotel is large, clean and beautiful. The design to enjoy the hotel is so good, you have window and large balcony. I love waterfalls and lotus lily there. The restaurant next to the pool also good."
5,"Love the smiles, love the services, love the warmth, love the staffs. It was my first time coming to Bali and came for a course I signed up with another party. I was amazed by the building structure and view when I first stepped in Grand Hyatt. All the plants and landscape are well maintained and staffs were sooooo nice as they always great you with their smiles. I will be back for sure!"
5,"nothing to add, covered all my conscious and unconscious expectations, beautiful nature/gardens across the entire premises including lobby, service by staff beyond expectations, food overwhelming, pleasant, pleasant and pleasant"

3,"It was troublesome to extend my stay. The sales person tried to rip me off. But eventually I got the best price. Then the receptionist did not do proper linking with my original stay duration. Hence I got locked out of my room. And also lack of connectivity between front desk system with restaurant system, disable my membership discount to be applied automatically. Even the restaurant manager denied my discount several times, when I was actually eligible. I had to get angry to get the discount applied properly. This is a ridiculous thing to happen in a world wide 5 star hotel. There was also an event at a next door hotel, which caused a very loud noise at night time, even until 12 AM midnight, for several days. I asked the hotel to take action and call the police if needed. But…"
5,"Another wonderful stay. The hotel and gardens are breathtaking. The service in all ares is flawless, helpful and friendly staff everywhere you go. The gym was perfect for us, fully equipped and helpful staff there. The food is excellent and we dined at all restaurants. The rooms were very clean and tidy, and very comfortable, bravo to housekeeping! Special thanks to SUARNI (club Lounge) Dika (Club Lounge) and NEFRI (Nampu) who all delivered service from the heart, were attentive, super friendly and so kind. There are so many team members to thank as every single one of them was exceptional. This hotel and the staff are very special, we can highly recommend for an escape to paradise. "

5,One gets best value for money. Once inside you don’t need to go anywhere else in Bali. I will like to come here more offen. Food is excellent and variety is large. Hyatt is very beautiful and one loves spending time 
5,"I am Globalist member and travel a lot but somehow Grand Hyatt Bali stood above all the properties I visited with number one reson being its exceptional customer service before n during stay and ultimate breakfast, Indonesia and western food.  I was contacted by Hardi one of their specialist concierge agent days before my travel and he took care of all my needs from transportation, rooms or any other concerns. Since I was travelling with small child I had very specific questions but he prompted addressed them perfectly.  The property is amazing similar to Grand Hyatt Kauai if you ever have visited but Bali is cheaper compared to Hawaii plus culture and food is much better. There is amazing nice clear beach along the property you can enjoy with your kids or urself with all kinds…"
5,The Grand Hyatt had everything you needed but also was close to other places to get out and about. The staff were amazing and the facilities were excellent. Great holiday for families with kids. Beach front room was excellent- close to the beach for access and a short stroll to the pool.
5,I strongly recommend the Grand Hyatt Bali. Their strength is the warmth and service provided by their staff. Breakfast is terrific and the pools very inviting. The access to a very long beach with a lovely pathway is great allowing enjoyment of the views. 
5,"Spectacular property built in traditional balinese style. Ponds with beautiful lotus found all across the hotel. It’s a massive property with spotless pools and clean rooms. Staff goes over and above to make you feel special and welcome. Complains and feedback is listened genuinely and appropriate action is taken to rectify. Morrisher, Ody, Feby, Vebi, Bridget and all the staff made us feel super special and took real good care of us.   Resort has private beach in great setting. They even set us up for a nice romantic dinner on the beach. Exceptional stay."

5,"I have have been staying at the Grand Hyatt Bali at least once a year since 1997, and it never fails to please. The facility is beautiful, and although not new, it has been regularly upgraded and updated, and is truly one of the most beautiful hotels in the world.  The staff is unfailingly kind and helpful, and the facilities are terrific.  There are many choices now in Nusa Dua, but the Grand Hyatt Bali provides a lovely, classy (in a low-key way) visit.  You can't go wrong by choosing this hotel. I would recommend it to anyone who asks..  "
5,"We were recently here for our family holiday. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff very friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The location of the hotel is great for getting out for walks or day trips. Food at restaurants was very good we were surprised by the quality. I’m vegetarian though so after a week it became a bit repetitive, I wished there were a few more options. Great for families! We will visit again. "
5,"My wife and I returned for our fourth stay at this property and our first since Bali reopened to international tourists following Covid. All restaurants were open and the Hyatt Club lounge was operational. The hotel staff were super friendly as has always been our experience here. We arrived straight after the G20 was held in Nusa Dua and it wasn't very busy. As a Hyatt Globalist, the hotel upgraded us to a lovely suite where we could look out our window to a picturesque lagoon. Both the club lounge and the Club pool area were <50m from our room. We spent a week dividing it time between the pool, the beach and some of Bali's wonderful restaurants. For anyone planning a stay here, we would highly recommend it. One thing to note is the nearby Bali Collection mall has only about…"
4,"Nothing bad to say about my stay besides that the room was ok, but not in perfect state. Staff was very friendly, shower was good , bed was great…. Hotel Is huge whichever something you must like. It was not that busy now but I wonder what it would be when fully booked. "

It seems the hotel was well maintained during the quiet covid period as well ensuring the property is in good shape. "

5,"Agung, along with his colleagues, are the friendliest FOH I’ve met in all my travels. Always has the most welcoming smile on his face and on hand to help with all your needs. Needless to say, my stay here has been wonderful and made even more so with the friendly staff. "
5,"We had an absolutely amazing family holiday at the Grand Hyatt Bali.  The facilities were all excellent and they had a great range of restaurants on site which made our stay really easy especially considering we were travelling with our young children.  The pools and beach were absolutely perfect for the family too.  We also recieved wonderful service from the team in the Grand Club.  The manager, Urip Ariawan was a kind and attentive host and his team always offered us wonderful service and friendly smiles!  Thank you so much Urip for taking care of us so well!"
4,"There's a reason that President  Biden stayed here last week.  Its unimaginably beautiful with a generally hi level of service.  Nice fitness club/pool/beach.   Our buffet breakfast was included and was good. Problems involved getting our drinks from the hostess (day 1 = 10 minutes for OJ, day 2 our drinks never arrived. ) The OJ at the buffet was watery.  But the food was excellent!   Also,  there seemed to be a lot of confusion on confirming that our breakfast was included both days when we left, including calls to the front desk.  Day 2 we left after 10 minutes and told them to bill us if not included.  You'd think they would know how to do this.   All 3 ellipticals were not broken  day one, but by day 2, 2 of them were fixed. But as i said it was an excellent fitness club. …"

Our room was clean and spacious, my only complaint there was the closet inside the bathroom. This was a little difficult for two girlfriends because we couldn't be in/out of the closet getting ready while the other was showering. the bathroom did have a nice soaking tub and the toilet had a separate door. The property is huge so if you want to be closer to the lobby, request the West tower. The beach here is unbeatable, warm, calm and very shallow, you could walk out forever. There are many pool options for all ages although we never did figure out how to access the elusive adult-only pool.…"
5,Best Resort with high tier customer service!! I couldn’t ask for anything better then what I’ve received. Definitely giving the whole staff an A+ especially Ninik. One thing i forgot to mention is the food and drinks. Also an A+
5,"Everything about this resort and our stay was perfect!  So much to do in this huge property, but each experience feels like it's just for us.  Staff were very accommodating to our personal needs.  Between the hotel and the Bali Collection shopping center next door, we never left the area for 4 amazing days!"
5,"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali during the G20 Summit and added a day to enjoy the facilities. It is a beautiful property on the beach, with multiple swimming pools, restaurants and many unique tropical gardens. Great staff throughout with special compliments to Hardi Sidarta at the front desk who helped with transportation and was very pro-active throughout my stay. A superb property and a place that you should stay while in beautiful  Bali."
5,"After staying in many resorts in Nusa Dua area, this really surprise me for quality service, rooms and facilities.  The hotel has a Balinese design very well put togheter, making you feel really in Bali. Most impressive is the beauty of the gardens, a santuary for birds. Around 30 years build property only could relay in a very compromise team workers, some had tells me work in the site since opened. The rooms are big comfortable, updated and with balcony's. From italian cusine to japanese restaurant, shopping mall inside to huge piscina and beach area, wellness center that was  big and modern and tennis court.  With soo much to do in inside the property was perfect to just stay relax , entertain and get away from trafic roads and busy Bali at the time. Sure we came back."

5,"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali during the G20 Summit and added a day to enjoy the facilities. It is a beautiful property on the beach, with multiple swimming pools, restaurants and many unique tropical gardens. Great staff throughout with special compliments to Hardi Sidarta at the front desk who helped with transportation and was very pro-active throughout my stay. A superb property and a place that you should stay while in beautiful  Bali."
5,"After staying in many resorts in Nusa Dua area, this really surprise me for quality service, rooms and facilities.  The hotel has a Balinese design very well put togheter, making you feel really in Bali. Most impressive is the beauty of the gardens, a santuary for birds. Around 30 years build property only could relay in a very compromise team workers, some had tells me work in the site since opened. The rooms are big comfortable, updated and with balcony's. From italian cusine to japanese restaurant, shopping mall inside to huge piscina and beach area, wellness center that was  big and modern and tennis court.  With soo much to do in inside the property was perfect to just stay relax , entertain and get away from trafic roads and busy Bali at the time. Sure we came back."
5,"It was the first time, my wife and I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua, Bali. We have family living in Bali, who recommended we stay  at the Grand Hyatt, whilst we visited them. And what an excellent recommendation it was!  The Hotel is set in the most beautiful & picturesque of grounds, in the style of traditional Balinese water temples. The grounds are immaculately maintained & present an opportunity to take a relaxing walk to explore every part of the hotel.  There are photo opportunities everywhere!   The accommodation is also well maintained & we were lucky enough to experience the Grand Club facilities, which made our stay extra special. We have never experienced such a consistently high level of hospitality back in the UK. Each & every member of staff engaged us…"
5,"After the Covid-19 lockdown, my family and I were able to visit Bali again and booked Grand Hyatt Bali starting November 6. We did not realize this area is the center of the G20 meeting. In a way being part of G20 history is exciting but also not the best for a relaxing vacation. Security is all around the area with horse patrol on the beach, armed soldiers, a warship nearby, armored military vehicles, and special police all over. I was at the beach café for breakfast and tried to get away from a bee and said the wrong word, “KILL .. the bee”, three special police turned around and looked at me.  This is the largest resort I have visited. There are 4 separate villages. The whole area looks like a tropical rainforest with ponds, fish, trees, and birds. I even saw a lizard that…"
5,Stayed 4 nights at Grand Hyatt.  stunning grounds that are kept immaculate by the staff. Beautiful ponds filled with lotus flowers. Breakfast had a good choice to suit all tastes and we enjoyed the Street food inspired evening restaurant and entertainment. (think it’s only on twice a week) Bali Collection across the street is still rebuilding since covid but Nusa restaurant had great burgers and cocktails for a reasonable price. We hired a driver/guide and did a tour of waterfalls and temples for a day away from lounging around a pool. all in all a fantastic beach front hotel with beautiful grounds and pools.
5,"We stayed for 9 nights and the service was excellent. All staffs were friendly and some even remembered and greeted us by our names. Well done!  Rooms appear dated but we were not bothered as we spent most of our time by the pool, spa and a couple of days of sightseeing. Bed was comfortable, daily supply of bottled water and housekeeping was good. We ordered room service a couple of times. Fast delivery in less than 30 mins and food and drinks are well covered.  We took ala carte breakfast daily and staffs were attentive to even remember our previous days orders. We also dined at Salsa Verde a couple of evenings, entertained by 3 talented musicians going round the tables and playing music to our request. Dinner at Pasar Senggol was amazing with dance performances. Love the…"
5,"The place is insanely beautiful, so many interesting facilities, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. You can stay here all day and won’t get bored at all. Definitely recommend everyone to stay here."

5,Had a wonderful Stay Lovely Hotel staff were so Friendly and Helpful. Food was delicious and restaurants on the ground so tastey and good choice to cater for everyone  place was lovely and clean and well kept 
2,"The hotel is very old and not maintained well. While the food quality is good, the beach is beautiful and the staff works hard to give a good experience, the hotel is riddled with bugs and the condition of the rooms are terrible. For the price, you will be better off staying elsewhere."
5,"As our time here comes to an end we wish magically we could stay an extra two weeks. As a Melbournian the challenges of the last three years have been sweetened by our time here. The staff, Reka and Sukerti to name a few have been exceptional and have gone beyond the usual service one is accustomed to receiving at a Hotel like the Grand Hyatt. All restaurants we had the pleasure of eating in provided nice quality food. We were greeted with such genuine hospitality one can’t help being charmed by the Balinese culture each time we visit. I have no hesitation in recommending the jewel in the crown of Bali right here. I am sure any future visitor will be genuinely touched by the warmth and hospitality we have received all while flawlessly managing R20 and G20 around us. …"
5,"2nd stay at Nusa Dua and the hotel, location and service were all great again.  The staff are always helpful and not too formal - just nice and friendly.  It would be good if they didn't have to wear masks, but maybe not all guests agree with that.  The Club deal is fantastic and the gym one of the best.  "
5,"It’s is a beautiful hotel to holiday in due to its amazing location, fabulous inclusions but more importantly the incredible staff that make this an exceptional experience. It’s an oasis away from the usual hustle and bustle of other towns like Seminyak and Kuta  "

1,"We bought a Qantas deal with lots of extras in April , on points. Last week we were emailed that the hotel had cancelled our booking because of the G20. Interestingly our friends, who paid, have not been cancelled. We were offered Sanur but we have a party of 10 in Nusa Dua. Our friends cancelled their reservation. Both couples have lost money and we have had to use a lot more points to get accommodation nearby. Apparently the Hyatt doesn’t honour guests when others can pay more or are more important. Not happy!"
4,"We had an amazing time at the Grand Hyatt. We stayed through Luxury Escapes. The rooms are a little old and dated but we found we spent ALL our time outside. The pools and beach are stunning and our 3 children loved every minute. We used the sports facilities such as tennis, cycling, squash and on the one rainy day it was lovely to relax at the lobby bar with drinks and cake while the kids went to the Kids Club (which they really loved and begged to go to every day!). Food was faultless. Service was impecable and friendly. The guys at the Pool Bar were brilliant - in particular Wirian who was so helpful, friendly and  welcoming to us and the kids. Overall a wonderful stay and we really hope to be able to stay again."
3,"I think for a Grand Hyatt property, this hotel has some improvement opportunities especially if you are a Hyatt member and have experienced the best of what Hyatt can offer. My experience summed up in the title of my review. Thanks for reading!"
4,"Before I arrived here, I'm pessimistic because all of my colleagues said this is an old establishment, so I didn't expect much.  When I arrive at the lobby, I'm still not convinced. But all started to change when I see the resorts, and how well maintained this establishment is despite the age. And when I entered the room: Boom! I'm impressed, not to mentioned we had balcony viewing the lake. Too bad I'm on the first floor, not the third or the fourth.  During the dinner, I was taken aback by the brisket, it's so juicy and tender. Felt like heaven in my mouth.  But there's two things bothered me during my stay: 1. The toilet on 3111 can't flush properly. I need to flush twice then wait another minutes or so to fully flushed my dump. This is a major red flag for 5 star…"
2,The hotel has a prime location on the beach in Nusa Dua however the hotel did not have enough staff this maybe down to the Indonesian goverment only recently opening up Bali after the covid pandemic however the hotel has become very tired looking and the rooms require updating/rennovated.

2,Wife had to get emergency medical care after severe diarrhea for 4 days.  Bathroom smelled like sewer.  Had to request assistance 3 times before getting service.  Repairman came after 5 hours and fixed electric problem that was causing vent reflux in bathroom blowing exhaust from other toilets into ours.   
5,The Grand Hyatt Bali did everything in their power to make sure my wife and I had a perfect vacation. We were thrilled from the first day to the last and overwhelmed by the hospitality of all the staff and the dedication to make our honeymoon unique and unforgettable. 
4,"Our stay was pleasant and enjoyed every minute we spent there.  I would like to bring to your notice, following points; 1) Bathroom door was not closing. Reported to front desk, but no action taken. 2) King bed was squeaking bad, even for mild rolls. It was uncomfortable. 3) TV and receiver remote was not working.  4) Mini bar was empty..... why??"

5,"We loved our stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali in Nusa Dua. We recently stayed at a premium suite with connecting twin bed rooms and the accommodation was excellent. The room was beautiful with balconies overlooking a pond filled with blooming lotus flowers. We enjoyed sitting here after a day of swimming watching the rain. Made Dwipayana at the front desk made us feel so welcomed upon check-in and even offered to assist with dinner reservations without us having to ask. We also loved the expedited check-in process as globalist members and we’re impressed with the offerings and staff at the club lounge. Everyone we interacted with was very warm, friendly and thoughtful. I also highly recommend dinner at Pasar Senggol. The variety of Indonesian food offerings was wonderful and our…"

4,"I stayed at the GH 15 years ago and little has changed in that time. That's something of a double-edged sword as the grounds of this hotel take some beating and are truly breath-taking .The rooms could do with freshening up to be honest, although having said that everything worked and they've done a good job at maintaining them. We stayed room-only but opted for the breakfast on a couple of mornings. Much as i'd remembered, the range of hot items is a little sparse compared with other 5 star hotels in this part of the world, but there's no denying the quality is there and if you're a fan of pastries you won't feel short-changed as they are fresh and delicious .We also opted for the Pasor Sengall evening dance and buffet. It was an excellent spread with unlimited satay, rendang…"
5,"A 5-star property, with excellent food, service and facilities. We thoroughly enjoyed the lagoon pool with waterslide and spent many afternoons lunching at the pool. The Japanese restaurant (only open limited nights) offered world class sushi and Japanese dishes and so we ate there twice. The service is attentive and friendly. The service extends to the beach which is quiet and picturesque."
2,"Had to change rooms TWICE, first due to the CLEANLINESS, very dusty and overall had looked run down, second due to broken items, fixtures and fittings and Brown tap water! The Duty Manager Eni was very helpful and did push to upgrade us but unfortunately it had already left a bad taste.  Breakfast didn't have enough variety unfortunately considering it was buffet style breakfast. We visited a few of the restaurants at the hotel, the Japanese, Italian and Indonesian. Very mediocre yet exceptionally high priced. Didnt find the food value for money and as a result wandered to nearby restaurants for lunch and dinner. There was the same entertainment each night at the Indonesian restaurant and the same live band playing the same songs every night. Again, spent our time venturing out…"
4,"At each end of the Grand Hyatt's beach path, there is a gate.  But once inside those gates, there's barely a reason to leave if you have decided to have the easiest, least authentic experience of another country you can have.  That was what we wanted with our 4 and 6 year old children.  The pool.  I have never seen a pool like it: it has tunnels, bridges, 2 waterslides (1 big and 1 small) and endless space.  There is quick, good poolside bar service with $11AUD cocktails (as of Sep, 2022), and pretty good food.  There were 2 other pools that we didnt even get to in our 7 night stay.  The kids club runs some great events and some passable ones.  The ""learn to swim like a mermaid"" was the best one by far.  However, if you want an ""adventure kids club"", i think you need to go…"

Room is overlooking the lagoon and very relaxing atmosphere. The club lounge is big and has plenty of offerings during cocktail hours. It is surrounded by the lagoon which is nice. However, it is humid especially during the day as it is an open air area and no airconditioning. The kids loves the main pool, I enjoyed the quite and exclusive club pool. The beach also just a walk away and its fairly clean and not so many people. Breakfast at the restaurant is nice, a bit crowded but they manage well. Food selection is extensive and quality food. The resort area is big and very nice atmosphere throughout. Will stay here…"
3,"Hyatt hotels need improvement so they are not understaffed, so that they respond more quickly and care more about guests. This is understandable because after the pandemic in Bali, but hotel management must immediately improve to restore Hyatt hospitality standards."
3,"Room:  My room was nice but there were serious drainage issues. First my shower wouldn't drain and flooded the bathroom then when they fixed it I started getting REALLY foul smells from it. It was really bad. Luckily I was there for a conference and just used the room to sleep n shower.   Many other conference goers didn't have a positive experience. I heard issues around mosquitoes and room cleanliness.   Feedback:  The GM (Morissher Loduwijk) sent me an email asking me for my feedback. I wanted to explain my circumstances but he didn't bother to reply to my email or have a member of staff look into it.   With lots of other options in Nusa Dua, I'd consider the Westin, St Regis, Ritz Carlton, Laguna or other properties as an alternative."
5,"Stayed a week in the Hyatt Bali. Was a great place for families. Had a young child with us and she loved the pools. We took the option of the Club access and the breakfast was good. It's an American breaksfast with an egg station, bacon, sausages, (No beans though). Plus there was pastries, pancakes, Pho and the usual yoghurts, cereal etc. In the evening there was canapes and beer/wine.   The best part of the stay was the service at the pool bar. The food was good, not over priced and our main pool bar waiter Surya was outstanding. So polite, so attentive, always smiling. He is a very good ambassador for the Hyatt brand.  We would return and hopefully meet Surya again :)"

3,"Stayed 3 nights at this property with a large group of friends for an event. In short they stay was a disappointment and there are better options to choose from. I would go so far and state, that the only Grand about the Hyatt is the size of the property.  It is in need of a serious refurbishment of the interiors to be par with like minded properties, rooms look old and outdated.  On the positive note the beach is very nice and so are the large landscaped areas.  Most of staff in F&B areas are struggling to understand English, assume the re-hiring after pandemic lock down is a challenge.  Most annoying points where run down AC not working as per modern standards, hot & cold taps not mixing temperature properly etc.  Will I return, no, got better options to choose from."
3,"As part of an International group of likeminded business people, we held an event at Grand Hyatt Bali over the last 4 days. I was not impressed, I have used Hyatt many times but this is definitely well below average and I cannot recommend this unless you are willing to settle for less than quality. Staff are nice but not very helpful, AC controls are falling apart, condensate is dripping and it just seems like they are not ready to provide any quality service. Resturants allowed for zero inspiration and as such, eat outside"
3,"This hotel has stood still since it opened in April 1991. I first stayed here probably a year after it opened and again about 15 years ago.  Today when I walked in the reception are has not been updated, the tiles on the wall and sculpture as of day one.  Then to the room, I started in a King Club Deluxe, better than a Club room with that old fashioned day bed of no use.  The using points 10,000 a Premium Suite,Club Executive Suite King. both rooms have not had anything done to them in some 30+ years, even the curtains are the same and all the wood features are identical back in the day.  This is a sad affair when you are paying average US$220 for room and US$380 both ++ of 21% taxes  Now the worst of the worst, they sell both rooms as ""King"" or ""Twin"" a King is actually 2…"
5,"We have just returned from a 5 day, 4 night stay at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. Words cannot express what a magical time my we had staying at this wonderful hotel. My son and I were treated like royalty by the amazing staff from check in to check out. I felt truly relaxed for the first time in months...no doubt due to the serenity of the magnificent gardens and water features that cover this whole expanse of the grounds. I think what made our stay truly special was staying in the club access rooms (we had room 2133) which gave us access to the club lounge for breakfast, cocktails from 5-7pm and all day refreshments. The rooms themselves were big, comfortable and wel equipped..the bed was super firm and comfortable and we both slept like logs during our stay. It may not be the…"
2,"Bad staff and lazy staff, they didnt want deliver my goods to my room , cant late check out, slippery bathroom, some electricity device broken, breakfast not to good and didnt give flexibility for ""breakfast time"" "
3,"Stayed 3 nights at this property with a large group of friends for an event. In short they stay was a disappointment and there are better options to choose from. I would go so far and state, that the only Grand about the Hyatt is the size of the property.  It is in need of a serious refurbishment of the interiors to be par with like minded properties, rooms look old and outdated.  On the positive note the beach is very nice and so are the large landscaped areas.  Most of staff in F&B areas are struggling to understand English, assume the re-hiring after pandemic lock down is a challenge.  Most annoying points where run down AC not working as per modern standards, hot & cold taps not mixing temperature properly etc.  Will I return, no, got better options to choose from."

5,"We loved it. All the food was excellent (Indonesian, italian and japanese). The nights with the indonesian buffet market watching the balinese dance were awesome. The food was so yummy there and at buffet breakfast. The staff are brilliant and so polite. There were lots of little things that showed they've been trained well and are very attentive. The pools, spa and beach were excellent. my kids loved it. my kids loved the kids club activities too. The bed was a little hard and some days the service was slow in the restaurants but other days it was nice and quick. Tip: they give you a few bottles of water a day in your room for free, but to buy more at non resort prices, we just walked to the coco supermarket. The one at bali collection mall is closed but there is another one…"
5,We occasionally visit bali a few times every year and nusa dua is one of the place we always visit on our last few days. It's our second stay this year in grand hyatt bali and it's during our birthday period. It was not so pleasant on our first stay however they delivered an exceptional experience during our second stay. Thanks to pak Dwi that always went extra miles to ensure we enjoyed our stay. The property is still very good and located in a premium location in nusa dua area. The pools are excellent and we always love their japanese restaurant nampu. They also have a private beach access that you can visit directly. I would recommend for couples and families who seek an ideal short escape in bali since this property will set your face directly into holiday mood. 
4,"The resort is huge, the beach is great, and the facilities are great. I didn't have much time to explore much of the resort this time, but will definitely be back. The breakfast was average, was expecting better "
5,"Our recent stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali was exceptional. We enjoyed every moment. We stayed for for 10 nights and every single day, staff, service and general hospitality were brilliant!  Pari from the pool area is amazing. His attentiveness, friendliness, kindness and general personality are a credit to the hotel. He made our time at the pool always welcoming.  Also from the pool area, Surya, another great asset for the hotel!  Breakfast at the Grand Lodge was the perfect way to start the day, and the various restaurants  in the hotel were overall excellent; we tried them all, our favourite was Pasar Senggol - amazing food and a great Balinese show to boot.  A beautiful, quiet beach is on the doorstep of the pool and the grounds of the hotel are immaculate.  All in all, a truly…"
5,We have travelled to Bali for the last 20 years. The Grand Hyatt is the best hotel we have stayed in. Although the hotel is 30 plus years old it is in good shape. Our room 3132 was on the south side and we had an ocean glimpse. So suggest 3232 and above for a view. The rainfall shower head was terrific. In the room itself the king size bed was huge. Everything else is what you expect in a 5 star room. The gardens are magnificent and the pool areas are a feature. Each day we had breakfast at the Garden Restaurant. Bear in mind look all hotels the Grand Hyatt is transitioning from the enforced Covid 19 hibernation. Breakfast got better everyday. Check in and check out was seamless. All the staff were friendly and helpful. THE STAND OUT STAFF MEMBER WAS ADEL WHO GREETED US EACH DAY…

4,Stayed at Grand Hyatt after several years and over 12 years later. The property is still very good and thankfully busy like in the pre-pandemic days. Rooms and the buildings have aged naturally and possibly during the pandemic but the service and professionalism is still intact. Watched the dance performance over dinner and had dinner at the Italian restaurant near the beach both of which were good. Very good option at a Nusa Dua.
4,Great location and a great team working to make your visit relaxing and enjoyable. The location is great and pools are excellent. Get the grand club package if it is available. Gym was great and loved the ice pool at the sauna area
5,"To return to Bali after the recent global pandemic was such a wonderful experience.   For a country that largely survives from tourism we were a little apprehensive about what we might find especially for the Balinese people.  We were keen to support the local economy as much as possible.  First stop was Grand Hyatt Bali at Nusa Dua.  Having stayed at this property some five times, we were thrilled to see the hotel still looking at its best.    From our smooth arrival and check-in, through to the tastefully appointed opulent suite, we were quickly eased into a relaxed holiday mood.  This is a wonderful property and should be on everyone’s must-stay list.  Perfect for singles, couples, groups or families, it provides the perfect escape from the hustle of the bars and nightclubs…"
5,"A great place to stay at Nusa Dua in Bali. Great views, plenty of amenities and staff are very helpful. Stayed there for a week for a business conference and had a great time there. Wifi was good, location was near the airport and there were plenty of spaces such that even the business conference didn't bother the other guests as well. "
5,"I stayed for 3 nights in this Hotel and is highly recommended, Great location with very welcoming atmosphere and beautiful beach. The staff throughout the hotel were very professional, friendly and extremely helpful.  The breakfast  at Garden Cafe including the Grand Club were amazing, including a very good taste of foods, nice bali’ coffee. Salsa verde provide a nice and authentic Italian cuisine. The room was very spacious and well equipped with all essentials and fantastic view. The jogging track along the beach is one of nicest place in the hotel  Overall its beyond my expectations."

As Bali wakes up from the Covid closure of the island to tourists, we had a marvellous time mixing our time across the four pools and the various restaurants on the premises. Staff are very friendly and professional and the location is straight onto the quiet beach of Nusa Dua. Can’t wait to come back again."
5,Who is looking for great resort for a resting holiday I recommend Grand Hyatt. Personnel are great and looking after all your needs. Pool Bar personnel are great. Coctails are great  Highly recommend this resort.
4,My family had a great time at the resort.  Service and facilities were excellent.  The only thing i hope that Hyatt can improve on is the breakfast spread.  That would certainly make the holiday perfect.  
4,"I've been to the Grand Hyatt several times now and I'm giving this a nostalgic 4 star rating, mainly because overall it's a lovely huge resort with many swimming pools. That's actually the primary reason we went back as we wanted to get away from winter and do lots of swimming. Club lounge staff were fantastic, in particular Mrs Ida, Mrs Suri (sorry I don't recall her full name) and Mr Agus from the afternoon shift, and Chef A (mature gent from the breakfast shift). The food selection at breakfast and in the evening was excellent. We paid for a Club ocean view balcony room but were given a ground floor room with no ocean view. However, it was just steps from the beautiful Club pool, so we didn't ask to be changed. The room itself was a good size, with a huge bathroom, but the…"
5,"Coming back to Hyatt Bali again after our last visit on May. It's good to see that Hyatt delivering their best service so we can experience the Hyatt standard. Thank you also to Pak Dwi, who was ensure that we got best experience in the property. Check in process is smooth. The room is very clean and spacious. We are grateful for the setup for our birthday (thank you for going extra mile). The view is breathtaking. Aircon is cool. The bed is comfy. Superb stay experience!  "

5,"I know this hotel like since 20 over years ago, but amazingly when I went there this year, there is no old look at all... The room itself is big and spacious as a trademark of grand hyatt with grand room... And some more the garden is amazingly taken care and very nice. Even during pandemic, they really put effort on the garden and pool. The next day breakfast was also very very nice... Not anly the variety of the food and drinks but also very good in quality...  It is all great.. the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Cant wait to stay there again"
5,"We travelled with three little boys, and the whole experience was amazing. Although we typically leave and explore places when we’re on vacation, we felt so welcomed and entertained on the resort. The kids loved every bit of it too. They had 2 hrs of free kids play at the kids club, which gave my wife and I time to relax as well. All the staff were super accommodating and helpful. One of the best vacations we’ve had. "
4,"Landscape setting is one of a kind; Resort with most beautiful gardens in Bali! If you are looking for a traditional, well maintenanced place to stay: this is it. Staff are very well trained and super friendly: Komang Sutrisna, Murka, Agus were literally reading our wishes from the lips. Thank you all for let us feel like in a big family; we will be back for sure!"
5,"Spent 10 days at Grand Hyatt Bali and it was simply amazing. The hotel grounds were beautifully landscaped, the staff were friendly and the whole experience was fantastic. We were celebrating a special birthday milestone and as Globalist got a suite upgrade which was great with awesom pond and ocean view. A lovely cake was sent to our room with candles, a very nice touch from the staff, especially Morissher Loduwijk, who reached out before our arrival and was super responsive to our requests. Kudos to the pastry chef! Nampu restaurant was excellent. Breakfast was always yummy. The beach staff serving drinks and lunch were very attentive. We will always have very fond memories of Bali. A big thank you to the whole Grand Hyatt Team!"
5,"Absolutely beautiful resort. It is huge, with the most beautiful gardens, ponds, pools, statues and landscaping. Well trained staff, and plenty of pool chairs. Try the High Tea!!! Only 260k++ per couple, it was excellent value. I spent my birthday here and it was a wonderful, beautiful experience."

5,Great Stay at Grand Hyatt Bali. Perfect place for family vacation. Food was great specially the Pasar Senggol. Kids love the pool and water slide. They enjoy the bunny feeding at Kids Club too. Really recommended. 
5,"Absolutely stunning hotel.  The grounds are amazing.  Loved being amongst nature we saw a monitor lizard and water dragon which was so special.  Food was delicious, room spacious.  The waterslide and kids club was a hit with my children it’s a holiday they will never forget.  The beach side of the hotel was spectacular and the music they played so super cool and relaxing.  Having a beer under the palms on the beach was so lovely. I  wish the lazy river/waterfall was up and running and hopefully the salsa bar opens up again also.  I would rate this hotel 10/10.  Highly recommend. Thanks for having us we will definitely be back.  "

5,"We had a week here to start our holiday and it was great. A lovely resort and although large you never felt like your in something so big.  The gardens were immaculate and a pleasure to just stroll about.  Although there were plentry of people the place never felt like it was full or crowded and you could always get a lounger by the pools or on the beach.  There are two free form pools which were great for cooling off and as the resort fronts onto the beach there a wide sandy beach to stroll on or enjoy the waves in the sea.  There were 2 restaurants that had not reopened but that was not a problem for us, we tried the other 3 and the food was excellent and although slightly more expensive than outside not so much to worry about.  Staff were great throughout.  We took out a…"

3,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 16 nights.  The hotel is over 30 years old therefore rooms a little dated, however the gardens and pools are exceptional, great for families.  The location and distance to local village and Bali Collection shopping area both very good for eating are within easy walking distance with no taxis required to either. The three restaurants within the hotel are ok for meals, however I would not rate them as 5 star. The beach frontage is great with lots of shade, however with the different tides not a great swimming beach for adults but shallow most of the day for children."
2,The Grand Hyatt is Very Expensive and in desperate need of updating.  Guest Rooms are outdated  $500+ per night - No Breakfast included. $34 for Breakfast and was poor. No airport transfer included had to organise ourselves. Small 20 year old TV and DVD players in the room.  Who still uses DVD? Wi-Fi slow and unreliable.  $31 for a 50ml tube of sunscreen says it all. Overall we were really Disappointed 👎 Great Location - Heavily Overpriced and No idea about what today’s consumer wants.
5,"Fantastic location, comfortable 1st class rooms, friendly helpful staff, fun in the sun resort— family or couple. We happy we chose Grand Hyatt Bali. Bali dinner show Highlight  — exquisite costumes dancing & food!"
5,"We are a family with a toodler of 1,5 years old. This stay was our last stop in Bali and we had an amazing stay during our last 4 days. The beautiful garden, the spacious seaview room with a little balcony, the great breakfast at the grand club, the beautiful pool, the good restaurants, of course the kind staff everywhere especially to our son, everything... Our special thanks to Amrit and his team, the F&B managers Reka, Urip, Agus, who made sure our experiences enjoyable, and others obviously. We will definitely come back."
5,"My family and I stayed at Grand Hyatt Bali for 5 nights . We had booked a Suite which we got a great Deal on from the Hyatt website. The Grand Hyatt Bali is one of the old Dame of the bali hotels , it was built well over 25 years ago and has a huge frontage on the Nusa Dua beach , but I’m saying this it really doesn’t show its age the property it really well maintained and the up keep of the landscape and room interior were all well kept. The resort itself is huge and you will easily get lost especially at night time. The pool and restaurant are all very good . The quality of the food at Salsa Verda were we had lunch every day was outstanding my wife who is Italian had a risotto for lunch one day and honestly it was the best risotto I have tasted outside of Italy . The real…"

The Grand Hyatt Bali is one of the old Dame of the bali hotels , it was built well over 25 years ago and has a huge frontage on the Nusa Dua beach , but I’m saying this it really doesn’t show its age the property it really well maintained and the up keep of the landscape and room interior were all well kept. The resort itself is huge and you will easily get lost especially at night time. The pool and restaurant are all very good . The quality of the food at Salsa Verda were we had lunch every day was outstanding my wife who is Italian had a risotto for lunch one day and honestly it was the best risotto I have tasted outside of Italy . The real…"
5,"We have stayed at Grand Hyatt Bali many times over the past 20 years.  The team there are the clear ""experts"" in maintaining the unique character of the resort.  The friendly service is absolutely delightful and everything was ""grand"" from the clean & comfortable room, the daily breakfasts, restaurants and of course the beautiful pools.   We would not stay anywhere else in Bali except the Grand Hyatt. "
5,"Wonderful hotel for family vacation. Family friendly and landscaping is amazing. My kids love to play swimming pool, especially water slide. Fitness is also quite nice and spacious comparing other resort in Bali. "
5,"This was by far one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The resort itself is very clean and safe, there are many security guards making it feel secure. The staff are very friendly and welcoming and happy to answer any questions you have. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from with a variety of food options to suit everyone. A typical meal at the hotel I would say is around £6-£8. Pasar Senggol is a must do, they have this on Tuesday, Wednesdays and Saturdays, this is where there are dancers and buffet style food. A taxi ride costs approx £3-£6 to nearby restaurants if you choose to eat outside of the hotel. The hotel supply bottles of water in your room so there’s no need to go out and buy these. There are shops at the hotel however the Bali Collection is a short…"
5,"The place is fantastic. It is not the newest establishment in Nusa Dua, but is in very good condition. Rooms are spacious, everything is working fine,  same applies to amenities.  Service was outstanding all the time, and it would be fair to say that you won’t be disappointed."
5,from the moment we arrived quick check in  shown to our room in the East Village lovely view over lake/garden we had access to the club lounge which was lovely breakfast afternoon tea evening drinks and food galore.  Club members even have their own private pool area

5,"Thanks to all the staff for making our two week stay a wonderful experience. The gardens are magnificent and the food and room were wonderful.   All staff without exception were helpful, happy and smiling. We cannot wait to visit again."
5,"Stayed 5 nights for an extended family vacation. The resort is enormous with a number of onsite restaurants with very reasonable prices (by Australian standards). There are 3 different pool areas, the large main pool with water slides for children, a separate smaller pool for Club guests, and a pool attached to the gym. I spent most of my time at the Club pool as it is a little less noisy. The grounds are green and well maintained and there is direct access from the resort to a large clean beach with sun loungers and staff taking orders for drinks and food. All of the staff are very friendly and attentive, especially in the Club Lounge (if you have access), with breakfast and evening drinks being a great part of the day. The rooms are looking a little bit dated in places but for…"
5,"We loved staying the the Hyatt Bali. The staff are very professional, friendly and fun. The food was delicious in all of the restaurants. We loved the Japanese and Italian the most. The food was always fresh and everything was clean and hygienic. The pools are fantastic and clean and wind round to enable one to exercise and enjoy at the same time. The slippery dip is fun and my husband went down and said it was great. Nothing was a bother to the staff and they all responded eagerly with requests in a very timely manner. We will definitely come back! The rooms are clean and large with the shower having great water pressure."
5,Fabulous resort on beach at Nosa Dua.  Room and facilities were faultless.  Staff were very helpful and friendly.  Food and beverage prices are reasonable.  Sitting poolside is just brilliant.  Resort is low rise and we'll spread out.  Very quiet and peaceful in evenings.  Great for those wanting to relax and unwind.
1,"So where do I start?   We booked a post Covid trip to Bali, visiting 5 five star hotels, saving the Grand Hyatt until last. A hotel that I had wanted to stay at since my last trip to Bali.   We arrived early and the room wasn’t ready (not an issue we were early).   Walked down to the beach to get the kids a drink. Beach bar looked odd. Not Balinese, next to no seating, full sun and bottles only. No draught beer which was a first on the trip.   Decided against and kept walking. The pool looked small by comparison to other Nusa Dua properties. Wall to wall cheap plastic sunloungers. Towels scattered everywhere. Not doing a Covid thing but you could not have gotten anymore loungers into this area. Resembled a Costa Del Sol / Benidorm experience. Not like any of the other similar…"

5,The Grand Hyatt Bali is a wonderful hotel with attentive staff and great service. The club lounge is worth the additional costs. The rooms are well equipped and we had one on the ground floor overlooking the swimming pool which was wonderful. All in all i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Bali 
5,The Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua was a beautiful place to stay.  Everything was just perfect from staff to the room.  The food was of very high quality and service on point.  The pools were well maintained and water always sparkling clean. 
4,The pool and beach are perfect for relaxation and the facilities and kids club were fantastic for our three year old. The staff in the kids club were so friendly and attentive to the kids needs.  Quality of food in the restaurants was ok but we often experienced one main meal would be delivered and finished before the other arrived. We were very disappointed in the Nampu Japanese restaurant both in service and quality of food. Be sure to ask for a room away from the club lounge as they play loud music from around 6am.
5,"We enjoyed a fantastic stay at the Grand Hyatt with our children, and grand children. All are return customers and we were all welcomed and made to feel at home. After 25 years of stays at this fantastic property we will be back again next year."
5,"very good all of think,  I have one thing of memory, It about a person who cleaning poolside in the morning. he gave me a goodmorning message with big smile,  I thoght that was a reall service. thanks so much to have good memory of your hotel. "

5,Had a week here and could not fault the service or food. Special thanks to Sukanata for gluten free advice and Sutrisna in the Club Lounge. They were able to guide me to all the gluten free foods! I felt happy and safe to eat here.
4,"We went on a luxury escapes package,the Grand Hyatt Bali is a lovely hotel,our room was beautiful by the Balinese feature pool,nothing was too much trouble for anyone, staff excellent and polite , The garden cafe superb led by Bridget and her staff,the food at breakfast on the hot plates could have been hotter ,dinner always lovely  Salsa verde the Italian restaurant good but service exceedingly slow and meals came out cold needs to be addressed  All in all thank you for a lovely holiday especially as we can now all travel again  We will be back thank you"
5,At last we were able to visit. My concern was a 3 hour trip through customs was a bad reflexion on the whole island of Bali. The country should wake up as there was one staff member on the third stage of our incoming process. In the usual corrupt way one can pay $50.00 for a person to get you through in 15 minutes. Nothing has changed  
5,"The location , friendly staff ,  food service  all in all great 5 star experience....was upgraded to the next category room.  M rDwipayana, Made you are truly a gem of a person and  you made  the stay even more special with your kind hospitality and attention. Will visit  gain and see you soon."
4,"The Hotel itself has a very beautiful landscape, the staffs were really helpful as well. The downside I had during my stay was 2 out of my 5 nights here, i got up in the middle of the nights a couple of times because of what I believed were some activities from rodents on top of the ceiling in my room. And every morning at around 5:30-6 Am, the staffs will drag some sort of metal carts that makes unpleasant noises when you’re trying to get a restful sleep. My room was right next to Grand Club. I also didn’t get to enjoy the bathtub during my stay because when i tried to turn it on the water ran yellow, i tried to ran it for a couple of minutes hoping the water will get clear, although it becomes lighter, it was still yellow. I will give this hotel another try when I come back to…"

4,The Grand Hyatt is a great hotel for families. The rooms are comfortable but very dated. The beach fronting the hotel is excellent as it is clean and there is a large amount of open space so there is no lots of privacy. 
5,"This hotel is a world of its own, which is good because its quite difficult and far to get to any non-resort restaurants or shops.  The hotel has gorgeous grounds and beach.  The rooms are large and clean with comfy beds and spacious bathrooms. The balconies have good views but most don’t overlook the beach.  The breakfast is a delicious buffet with a large variety of choices including eggs and noodles made to order, but seating can be difficult on busy days. I was seated twice then returned to find someone sitting at my table.  The hotel needs to find some way to mark taken tables, or to better control those bypassing assigned seating to find their own tables.  In a buffet you need to be able to go get additional foods without fear of losing the seat while briefly gone and a…"
5,"Excellent hotel and resort facilities. Would recommend. Felt the breakfast in the club lounge could offer more variety, however it was still quiet sufficient overall. Landscaped gardens, Pool facilities, Proximity to the beach and friendliness of staff were the main highlights. "
5,We had a relaxing stay on a luxury escapes deal. All meals included and daily cocktails. The pools and water slide were perfect for our 6 and 8 year olds as well as our 2 and 4 year old nephews. Food was exceptional. Good selection of restaurants to have variety. Stunning grounds. It’s a shame that not all resorts are back up and running at Nusa Dua. Would definitely recommend Grand Hyatt for couples or families. We stayed in an interconnecting room and it was perfect for the four of us.
5,"Spent 8 days in the stunning resort. We were in a Club Executive suite which was amazing. It was enormous with a lounge, dining room, massive bathroom and bedroom,  and the balcony which opened up directly to the Club pool. We stayed at this hotel over 30 years ago, and it's still beautiful. The staff were so friendly and couldn't do enough to please us. We will definitely return."

5,"A beautiful well established hotel. Attentive staff. Amazing pools for all ages, peaceful green pool and fun resort style fun pool with slides for kids. Lots of sun loungers. Fun kids club. Breakfasts which leave you wanting  nothing more. Good Restaurant choice for breakfast and lunch/dinner. Spa is stunning, but five star prices. Nothing much available re kids entertainment at night, but kids so tired after pool/kids club play. Happy with our package with luxury escapes. We’ve been twice, we’d go again. "
4,"Fantastic eight days at the family friendly GH. The staff were so warm and friendly, nothing was too difficult. Great food options with a swimming pool that you could get lost in. Will be looking at options to return at a later date"
5,"I had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali in July 2022. I was here to attend a friends wedding in Bali and specifically chose this hotel instead of the recommended hotels (from the bride/groom). I had stayed here in the past and had a great experience so I chose to come back. Interestingly, the G20 finance meetings were going on during my stay so it was cool to see all the people in suits wandering around and all the different VIP cars with the country flags on them. The hotel gave me an upgrade to a suite which was amazing. The breakfast and afternoon snacks and drinks in the grand lounge were delicious and filling; I probably gained a few kilos from how good the food was. The hotel is beautiful and gorgeous. While it may be a bit on the older side compared to the…"
5,"This hotel does not let you down in any facet. Excellent rooms, facilities and staff. Had stayed here several years ago and was so pleased to find the hotel as good as ever. Just perfect for relaxing in the Bali weather. Large free form pools with water slide area for kids and adults but far enough away from main pool area so as not to disturb those quietly lazing by the pool. Amazing gardens surround the facility with tons of shade if required. Not as exposed as some nearby resorts and well situated if you care to venture out to local restaurants. Staff could not be more helpful or friendly. My only complaint is I cannot stay longer than two weeks."

5,"We were so impressed with the staff and facilities at the Grand Hyatt Bali during our recent stay. The resort was beautiful and spacious with a stunning entrance, gardens and pools and our room (Grand Executive Suite) was very clean and spacious with a seperate loungeroom and bedroom which accommodated our family of 4 perfectly. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome and the staff continued to be friendly and accommodating for the duration of our stay. The kids (and we!) loved the beach, pools and water slides and surrounding gardens that provided many options for shade around the pools to relax on a sun lounge and order drinks and food from the staff throughout the day. The 3 restaurants were all open and busy but you didn't have to wait long to get a…"
4,"We stayed for 7 nights in an ocean view room.  The last time we came to this resort was 11 years ago, so we were looking forward to returning.  We were a family with 2 older teenagers.  CHECK-IN: The check-in process was disappointing.  We were greeted by a mediocre man, who wasn’t very friendly and when I asked for some information, he said the bell boy would go through all that on the way to the rooms, which never happened.  Luckily, we had stayed here before, as we would have been completely lost.  After a long and delayed flight, it would have been nice to have been offered a welcome drink, which was part of our booking.  The hotel lobby was beautiful though.  As part of the check-in, the concierge forgot to ask for a credit card deposit.  We had the card in our hands, but…"
5,"Absolutely loved everything about this resort! All the employees are extremely friendly and professional, the facilities are outstanding (restaurants, accommodation, pools!!) and grounds are so well cared for.  We stayed in a standard room with 2 kids (9 and 11) sharing existing bedding and day bed. The room was very clean and comfortable, we had a gorgeous balcony on ground level overlooking the ponds which are filled with Lilly’s and fish.  We visited every restaurant and had a great choice of food. The Balinese night market is amazing and definitely worth booking in to, so is the Japanese restaurant.   We would definitely recommend staying here, we loved every second!"
1,"I visited Grand Hyatt Bali last July for a family vacation. The Hyatt World app is useless if you stay at this hotel. It's because nothing can be done with the additional reservation. You don't need to use the e-concier service either. Because nothing works. The room was full of ants and the Grand Club was disappointing. There is nothing around Grand Hyatt Valley and all food and beverage should be solved in the hotel or delivered by Grab. If I go on a trip to Bali next time, I won't use this resort.  이 호텔에서 그랜드 클럽을 예약하지 마세요. 저는 그랜드 클럽을 예약하고 꽤나 실망했습니다. 조식거리는 그다지 풍부하지 않으며 간단한 저녁 바 역시 개인적으로 실망스러웠습니다. e-컨시어지 서비스 역시 제대로 작동하지 않고 월드 하얏트 앱의 애드온 프로그램도 제대로 작동하지 않습니다. 방에는 개미가 영역싸움을 하는지 엄청나게 나왔으며 누사두아에서 스미냑이나 꾸따, 짱구든 어디로든 나가기 위해서는 그랩 가격의 2배를 줘야합니다. 호텔의 식음료 가격은 충분히 저렴하고 괜찮습니다. 발리에서 리조트에만 콕…"

The pool bar was great especially if you wanted to order from your lounger on the beach. Pari one of the pool bar men was extremely friendly and helpful and even gave us advice on what to see while we were there and even taught us some Balinese. We would definitely recommend it to our friends and family."
5,"The only thing that might have been improved with Grand Hyatt is that check in time. The check in starts at 3pm, which is kind of rare. Usually hotel check in starts at 2pm. So I was waiting quite long since I arrived at hotel at 12.30 and anticipated to be check it at 2pm"
4,"Hotel is good,nice environment,nice facility especially for kids.Clean beach nice pool,good breakfast.The minus things is i must wait until 16.30 pm to check in,which is very late for 5 stars hotel,chiller in our room was not work so i must wait for new chiller.And they not provide buggy for room located far from lobby."
5,"We just a great holiday at the Hyatt. Facilities were excellent, staff exceptional and would always do their best to accommodate your needs. The dining was really good and was great to have a lot of different restaurants to choose during the week. Great family spot to spend some time together."
5,What a beautiful Hotel with delightful gardens and a fabulous beach. We had a wonderful 4 restful days recovering from the jet lag! We chose Club which was really great as you had a dedicated lounge and pool . The service throughout was impeccable.
5,"We had a wonderful time here. Very large room overlooking the sea. Lovely restaurants including an Italian, Japanese and more local cuisine. The pool bar was great especially if you wanted to order from your lounger on the beach.

3,"So we just came back from Bali grand Hyatt Nusa dua,I am going to write this review on all aspect of this hotel. Location & services:- Fantastic location right on the beach, very big property & very well maintained ie:- gardens,pools,beach area,walking path etc very clean.Rooms(we are in ocean view) very big and specious, nice balcony and great ocean view. Also next to Bali collection( walking), been told that before pandemic it was very buzzing place but at the moment(29/6) it’s a ghost town only 2 shops are open out of 100. Services is 50/50,very slow taking food and drink order,either on the pool area or in restaurants, takes ages someone to come and take your order( wast fully occupied). Grand Hyatt is in hotel zone area which is very well maintained but nothing…"
3,Great location away from the hustle and bustle of The west side.  Food is average and service is chaotic.  However the staff are lovely.   Very few shops in the area and taxis are needed to go anywhere!  Not all areas have reopened - after the Covid lockdowns!
5,"Stayed here for 8 nights in a club room overlooking the ocean on the 4th floor (Top floor) Went to sleep with the sound of the lapping ocean waves and woke up to a gorgeous unobstructed ocean view. Check in was smooth around 10 mins. Check out was the same, Very impressed. We never used the main pools,We used the club pool just below our building which was mostly quiet, We used the beach as well as the pool, There are venders on the beach that some people find annoying but once you say your not interested they tend to leave you alone,   The sea was quite rough but there were people surfing. We used the lobby bar for evening canapés and drinks as the main grand club lounge was closed, Anyone can use the lobby bar but it never got overcrowded, The staff were welcoming and orders…"
5,"We had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt at the end of June and spent 7 days enjoying the exquisite food, service and stunning gardens and pools. The people working at the Hyatt are very friendly, polite and helpful. We were made to feel at home and also enjoyed the gym which was often quite quiet and peaceful. The gardeners have done a remarkable job maintaining the resort and the ponds are full of happy fish and stunning white and pink flowers. The hotel is also literally on the beach so you're right next to white sands and crystal clear waters. The room was good and room service do an excellent job cleaning up and making the bed etc. Overall the rooms are immaculate but could use an update in the future. We shared a king bed and the mattress and pillows were very…"
3,Booked club room but the grand club is also accessible by the NON CLUB guests during breakfast which resulted us not able to get a table at the grand club and we had to have our breakfast at the common restaurant. This is unfair for club guests! Why should we pay for club room when NON CLUB guests are also able to access the grand club??!!

5,I am very happy with my stay at Grand Hyatt as we returned to Bali after 2.5 years. We came last time just before covid and most of the hotel is exactly the same. The staff was welcoming with fabulous breakfast. The beach is secluded and clean with sun rise is just icing on the cake. We will definatly come back next year. 
5,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 8 nights and couldn't have asked for better. Just so beautifully maintained, lovely staff, great food and wonderful facilities. We have two girls aged 4 and 7 and they had an absolute ball in the pools and with the waterslides, as did we! The food around the pool did sometimes take quite a long time, but we just learnt to order before we were hungry so that the wait wouldn't be a problem. Would highly recommend."
4,"Arrived around 10 pm finally got into a room at 1.30 am. On a 2 person package but by myself. Dinner or lunch was for 2 but do you think the on duty manager would allow me a lunch for 1 and a dinner for 1, no way. He suggested I should just order 2 dinners and take one to my room. Padma in Ubud I did not ask they just offered a lunch and dinner voucher as did the Villas in Sunar. I had prebooked an accessible room, but no luck had to wait 2 days to be moved. I was at first put into a room with 2 steps a meter from the end of the bed down to a lounge. Accessible?? How about that in the middle of the night. Hence the 3 hour wait for another interim room in a hotel only half full. Took 4 phone calls to the front office, we will call you back, no call back. I will return because the…"
2,"We are a young family with 2 toddlers and frequent travellers to Bali and frequent stayers of Hyatt resorts however I cant say that we will be returning to the Grand Hyatt again.  Our recent stay has been very disappointing. We normally enjoy staying at Hyatt resorts but this stay as put a stain on a good reputation. Here are some of the issues we faced whilst staying here: - I used the Hyatt app to check-in to our room given our very late arrival. I figured it would save some time given we didn't arrive until mid-night. However for some reason, check-in into our room still took 20-25 minutes. A bit irritating given there was no one else checking in plus I'd already done it on the app. Whats the point of the app if its still going to take that long to check-in?  - We'd booked a…"
1,"The hotel is worn down and very dirty. Breakfast was very poor. The hotel is huge, it takes very long time to get to the pool or the beach. Kids club is dirty as well. Reception never picked up the phone so we had to go all the way down to get room service. They also had a wedding one night so we couldn’t sleep at all, no one warned us about the wedding…"

1,"My first visit to Nusa Dua.  If you stay on the ""south"" side of the property, be prepared to be disappointed.  The rooms are HORRIBLE!  Our first room, NOTHING (and I'm not exaggerating) worked.  No light in the toilet.  No air  The safe didn't work (couldn't set a code because it said O P E...what happened to the N? ) The television didn't work.  It was just horrible.  I shared my disappointment with Puspita (sp) she was very sweet and accommodating.  She actually took the time and walked with us to view the second room to ensure it was too our liking.  Thank goodness it was.  I wanted to take part in the afternoon tea.  The conceriage told me it was from 5pm- 7pm.  That's happy hour not afternoon tea.  Once I received the correct time and went down the next day for the tea, I…"
5,"This hotel is set in the most beautiful grounds! The staff are absolutely excellent!  Special mentions  to Meri, Ari, Suni, Dewi, Warti & Nadia for making us and our daughter, Ruby, so welcome and our family holiday so memorable!  Great sized rooms that were cleaned daily.  The food was delicious!  Several beautiful pools across the resort to enjoy.  Nusa Dua is quieter than other parts of Bali and very secure.  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and would love to go back one day!  Terima Kasih :-)"
5,"Yesterday, I joined the Grand Summer High Tea which costs only Rp. 260,000,++ already for 2 people and the food is this much at the Grand Hyatt Bali Nusa Dua! That's the price. Great deals! High Tea from 2 to 5 pm. After parking, I and Kak Widi, my best friend, were picked up by a buggy car to the lobby. Wow, the lobby of the Grand Hyatt is magnificent. Especially this lotus pond. So I want a staycation here. I went straight to the high tea place. After choosing where to sit, we chose to enjoy tea time indoors because it's air conditioned. Hehe. Menu served! The concept of the arrangement is ""Gebogan"" like a ceremony in Bali. There are various cakes, fruit, and salads. Bruschetta is available, as well as Pizza and more salads. My favorite is the Lavender Sour Cocktail with an…"
1,The service is pathetic. Had a bad experience with the services. One day we got delayed extremely coz our locker got locked in. One day we had to wait an hour to receive cutlery in the room. The property is very good. But service wise not very happy
1,"I have stayed here several times and have always been satisfied, only this time I feel disappointed with the service here, the front office staff named morrisher is very impolite in serving guests, really no manners, very bad, luckily I finally helped with Mrs.  Ariani who can handle guests well"

5,Good location. Grand club is very good. Puspa in grand club is amazing very welcoming. Selection of food and beverages good. Director Ayu made our stay better with her easy going and smiling personality. There are many pools perfect for family stay
5,"I just wanted to mention a very special thanks to Ari for wonderful service in chatting and looking after myself and my friend around the pool delivering food and Mojitos.   And Lisha the lovely lady who gave me one of the best massages I've had in my life she is very talented and a lovely, and deserves lots of praise.   I will be back again,  Kind Regards Max"
2,"We are staying in Grand hyatt now and they said use the qr code to book all your services, but guess what no one reads.. it is for booking all services at the property but no one looks at it. You have to use good old fashioned dial 0 and talk and put on hold forever."
5,"My wife and I decided to stay with Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua for our Honey moon and figured it would be an amazing time considering the hype behind Nusa Dua and its world class facilities. Upon our arrival we notice that there were a lot of families waiting in the lobby with only 2 people at the concierge checking them in. What a disaster that was. Does no one no how to do their jobs properly here?  After checking in and getting situated in our executive suite, we notice that the room was completely off from what we booked online. We booked an ocean view suite only to get the bottom floor, viewing a pond……mind you, we’ve let them know this was our HONEYMOON. After speaking with the front desk, not only did they not accommodate, they slander us saying we must of booked the wrong…"
5,We have just had ten perfect days of  holiday at the Grand Hyatt.  Although not every restaurant and bar was open because of low guest occupancy every effort was made by staff to ensure we had a really great time.  The hotel and grounds are kept in immaculate condition and the staff as always in Bali were helpful and friendly.  We loved the beautiful pools and enjoyed all the meals in all four restaurants where we ate. The evening we spent at Pasar Senggol was particularly enjoyable.

4,"I often forget writing review, just this time the whole experience at Grand Hyatt Bali must be mentioned. On our last leg on Bali holiday we decided to stay at Nusa Dua (3D2N) at first our room had several problems such dirty water (for bath usage) and mini fridge not working, even we found bits of chips and dried noodle on the floor, then somehow working phone is only the one attached in toilet. We made complaint to front desk, eventually the next day we received complimentary room upgrade and dinner at Salsa Verde. While changing room is actually tiring since we need to pack again (after unpacking 24 hrs before and need to check-out the next day) we appreciated the gesture from Grand Hyatt.  Aside from that, breakfast in Grand Hyatt is a good array of buffet. it’s very…"
3,"I have stayed at this hotel at least 100 nights.popped in for a few yesterday Unfortunately the club is closed but they are giving a select few drinks at lobby bar Unfortunately  breakfast is a s$$t fight very full with kids everywhere and people coughing without covering their mouths but more over the club pool has a heap of noisy kids screaming and splashing so not the serene adult type atmosphere it has been for the last 25 yrs have been coming.and that includes school holidays for 4 weeks at Xmas etc ,the clientele seems to have changed remarkably. Just stayed at the intercon and it is more serene and kids seems to be not running riot"
1,"There are bed bugs and fleas at 3460 room. I found itch around my body after the first night, and more itch and red marks after the second night. I consulted with my dermatologist and she confirmed it’s the fleas bite. Very disappointing for a 5 star hotel."
5,"I like the hotel and surroundings area of the hotel including the beach, they are clean and relaxing. The services from all hotel staffs are excellent from the time I checked in until checked out. I have no regret to choose the hotel for business meeting and family vacation."
5,"Beautiful space, Japanese restaurant was top notch. Fell asleep to the sound of ocean crashes, overall everything you would expect from the Hyatt brand. Rooms a little bit old (built in 1990) but are well maintained and exudes a certain charm.  "

5,"We stayed 5 days in the Grand Hyatt and it was one of the best experiences we ever had.   I travel with my 10 year old son and the first surprise was a room upgrade. To be fair that wasnt a room it was an apartment!  The ""room"" was so amazing that we hardly wanted to leave it. However, the ""river pool"" with the slide was a location we went to basically every day as well.  I liked the fitness club, decent size, everything in there what you need and the club where I enjoyed many espresso, cake and spring roles.   We were surprised about the evening parties at the beach - specifically the volume of the events. However, they normally finished at an acceptable time.  We thought that the garden cafe was better than the japanese restaurant.   All in all a clear recommendation!  "
5,Each person at the hotel were most welcoming and very hospitable . From time at check in to the duration the stay every one was caring and always smiling . The breakfast was prefect to start the day. The beach was clean and garden very well maintained 
5,"Had a most enjoyable 8 days. Room was spacious, food delicious and the staff were very friendly and went out of their way to please us. Two minor issues that I feel that the hotel should look into, firstly the shower should be hotter and secondly there should be rubber mats provided when showering as it was slippery at times. Will definitely go back if ever in Nusa Dua again."
4,"We had a really nice stay in Nusa Dua with our two children (2 and 6). However, Bali isn't really back to pre-Covid times, and lots of the facilties within the Resort were closed. There was only really one restaurant (of the usual 4?) open for dinner, and the shops nearby were also closed. Made us feel pretty isolated within the resort as we had catch at taxi for anything different (which is a huge hassle with two children), but this shouldn't last too long. We ended up ordering food to the room a lot of times.  Otherwise, the hotel is great. The pool is wonderful and the staff are lovely. The beach is amazing, although the water is not particularly child friendly as the depth drops very quickly, but the sand and beach is so clean and pristine, and quiet.  The room was ok, very…"

5,"Perfect place for family, the room spacious, but unfortunely we got broken refrigerator, but we think thats okay cause the room really close to the pool and the beach. what we love from grand hyatt is the breakfast, eventhough not much menu but the taste is excellent, the Pastry is our favorite, we score 10 of 10 for the pastry. The kids love the pool, try request the ground floor that close to the pool.. The hotel also has a direct access to the beach…The hotel is very spacious, we stay 2 nights but not yet explore the kids club, we’ll definitely coming back to Grand hyatt."
5,"This is probably the most exquisite property of Hyatt. Wonderful staff, spik and span, extremely good pool. The beach was soooo clean. Every morning we saw staff cleaning the beach continuously in the morning.  4 days passed like a blink of an eye. One must really go "
5,"We had a pleasant stay! The resort complex is very large, has a private beach, very large pool it has a mini water slide, my daughter was very happy! Very clean room, the location is good for healing & relaxing. The breakfast was okay not many choice of food. We will come back for sure!"
5,"Stayed at The Grand Hyatt for a week to attend a conference. Loved every bit of our stay. Got a South Village ocean facing room. The entrance is grand. The ambience is nice and welcome. The whole property is like living in a tropical garden with lily ponds and a rich flora and fauna. The swimming pool is beautiful. It has a number of eateries to tickle your taste buds and the cuisine is wonderful. Morris and his team is an experienced lot and they will make sure you go back with fond memories of their restaurants...specially the Breakfast and the Italian restaurant. Last but not the least, the smiling faces of the Hyatt staff will win your heart!"
5,"Very good hotel with a good location. The Pools are all good, the food has a lot of variety and is very good at the many restaurants, and the gym is OK too.  Great place to relax and have a holiday - have booked again for next year!"
5,"Perfect place for family, the room spacious, but unfortunely we got broken refrigerator, but we think thats okay cause the room really close to the pool and the beach. what we love from grand hyatt is the breakfast, eventhough not much menu but the taste is excellent, the Pastry is our favorite, we score 10 of 10 for the pastry. The kids love the pool, try request the ground floor that close to the pool.. The hotel also has a direct access to the beach…The hotel is very spacious, we stay 2 nights but not yet explore the kids club, we’ll definitely coming back to Grand hyatt."

5,"Overall, I had a great experience with the Grand Hyatt Bali. The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and the staff was amazing. There are wonderful private beach with huge swing, pool were great, kids love the slides. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Nusa Dua, Bali."
5,"I enjoyed my stay. It was rather a short stay for just 4 nights and 5 days. I would recommment based on the ambiance, lovrly swimming pools, spacious beach areas, cleaniness and definitely the good breakfast."
5,"The best hotel, with a great atmosphere, with very good service, I will come and stay again there if I visit Bali, a hotel with a beautiful and clean beach, and a very large swimming pool, we really enjoy the atmosphere, thank you Grand Hyatt Bali"
5,Stayed here for a conference. The facilities were fab. The breakfast was unbelievable. The hotel has very nice pool and beach. One the best stays. There is so much to explore within the campus and around. Very comfortable and enjoyable stay

Gave them a perfect rating as we have not encountered any problems or concerns during our whole stay."

2,"Maybe this is the worse 5 star hotel in service.   We stayed for 7 nights from beginning of May 2022.  1). Room service took a very long time to deliver the order.  2). One of the day, House Keeping didn't replace the Medium Towels, Face Towels, Floor Towels, Mineral Water, Coffee & Tea +sugar after making up the room.  I called the guest service. It took 45 minutes to deliver all of the items we needed.   3). One of our guest rooms was in troubles since the first night.  Air-conditioning wasn't cool enough,  Hot Water wasn't hot at all especially at night ( in the evening), so we felt too chilling for evening shower and bath.  We had reported that case, however, the engineering department could not really fix it properly, since the hot water temperature was unstable.   4). …"
5,"A good place to chill, amazing pool good for famillies. The beach is very clean, the food also yummy, warm welcome from all staff especially Pak Ari Sudana at pool bar, thank you for the personalized service, keep up the good work."
1,"Worst hyatt ever!!  i think i have to write this review for inform you before you book this hotel.  We have to wait for almost 2 hour for check in, and for 4 hour to get our luggage. After 3 times complaining about our luggage finally our luggage arrive. We have 3 times phone complaining and 1x going back to lobby and complain again for sofabed set up. First impression when enter the room is very old 😭, and smell like rooten mushroom. I told you that Room is VERY VERY TIRED and OLD ,we stay on 3212 3213 no refurbish at all, SMELL OLD ROOM, old woody furniture, my shirt also smell old 😭, dirty floor on balcony. Our sofa bed smell old fabric. I dont wonder why other guest still give 5 star for review. Distance room from lobby is very far, not recomended for family trip, the…"
4,"I am having a good time while staying in Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua, Bali. They have a spacious parking lot, lobby, and many rooms with different views and towers. From the lobby, you can walk for distance to the room and see a few shopping stores. The type of room I stay in was Grand Room, it has 60 meters with a bathroom, bathtubs, sofa bed, LED TV, and a balcony with a messy garden view. I feel that the room's musty smells lack fresh air and feel scary at night because the lights are yellow. In the morning, we had breakfast from 7 am in the restaurant with a view of the swimming pool and in front of the beach. The breakfast is just standard, the variety of the food is not many, but they have an egg station with pork bacon, sausage, and potatoes. I tried soto ayam on the first day,…"
5,"This place is amazing. My wife, 10 year old son, and I stayed here for a week before heading over to Kuta, and it is such a beautiful and well run hotel. We had such a relaxing time and the staff were amazing. We stayed at the Westin last time we came to Nusa Dua but I think we’ve found a new favourite - we’ll definitely be back. Thank you."

And when i requested bell boy to pick my baggage to check out, i wait for 30 minutes and nobody come. Hopefully the services getting better after the pendemic is over"
2,"We stayed here for 6 nights in May 2022.  Our check in was easy.  The grounds are well manicured and spectacular.  The room was clean and the pools were beautiful.That's where the compliments stop.  The service was not what you'd expect from a 5 star resort.  We usually waited at least 20 minutes at restaurants before being greeted and given a menu. We waited an hour for food on 2 occassions. Other times, our order was never put in and needed to be put in again after a long wait. The food is mediocre at best, especially when compared to nearby restaurants, and also caused me to get sick for most of our stay.  The hotel charges extra for many items that are free of charge at neighboring resorts, such as the kids club (free for 2 hours while others are all day).  There are also…"
5,"We had a wonderful few nights at the Grand Hyatt Bali on our honeymoon in a Grand King Suite . Although it’s clearly an older property, they’ve done an excellent job maintaining it and the service and helpfulness of the staff is second to none. I used to come 15+ years ago with my family and it feels just as special. The new Kriya Spa is also amazing, as well as the Grand Club lounge breakfast and happy hour/appetizers from 5-7 at the Veranda. Couldn’t ask for a better experience as a Hyatt Globalist!"
4,We had a very enjoyable time here with our 3 kids. We stayed the first week of April and the resort was pretty empty which we didn’t mind. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. Our room was the Villa Beratan which was absolutely stunning and came with the help of 2 butlers who switched off in the afternoon. Arya and Sri were wonderful and made our stay unforgettable. They were extremely helpful and great with the kids. The rooms were all very clean and well kept. The amenities were great and the pools were very warm. The only reason we didn’t give the review 5 stars is because the beach area which is designated for hotel guests has a lot of people selling things and they come in waves and don’t leave if you say no thank you. That is part of the experience in Bali as a…
1,"The hotel located in Nusa Dua. Great landscape with a good view towards the sea. Sadly, the check in process is totally a CHAOS. We came around 14.20 and informed that our rooms will be ready in 1 hour. Around 15.20 the bell boy is asking us about our key, we were confused. The FO said it wasn't ready yet. Around 15.40 we are asking again because some of the guests already checked in although we came first. I guess the Hyatt prioritize the foreign tourist instead of the local ones. Around 16.00 finally checked in. We were happy at first and want to rest. BUT LOOK WHAT WE FOUND IN BATHROOM. Totally speechless 🤐. Found some dirts also. The furnitures are well maintained but the bug in room? FIVE STAR HOTEL? Not sure that I will be back to this hotel again. The hotel manager…"

5,"Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua Bali is located at ITDC Nusa Dua Bali. The lobby is spacious and open, a bit hot but there is a light breeze. From the lobby we can see Nusa Dua beach with its blue water and white sand. At check in we were offered to wait and be seated. Not long after, the receptionist came to us with a registration form, a welcome drink of rosella iced tea, and 4 sanitizing wipes. We checked-in at 14.00, it turned out that after sitting down the clerk forgot to register us so that for almost 30 minutes we waited and other guests who came after us had also entered the room. But it doesn't matter because the check-in time on the voucher is also 15.00. We were given 2 room cards. The location of the rooms from the lobby is very far, we have to pass through many swimming pools…"
5,"Housekeeping: the service is meticulous. Sheets are changed every single day. Amenities are replenished if you require them. Floors swept & mopped daily. Two bottles of drinking water are supplied daily & they will happily bring more if  you need it.   Check-in:  like all admin & red tape in Bali, it takes time to check in but you are in a lovely area with AC & they give you a welcome drink.    The room: we stayed in the East Village for 9 nights. The room had a working safe, iron & fridge. The bed was enormous & super comfortable. Plenty of pillows too which I appreciated. The bathroom had a separate area for the toilet & a bath. Two shower heads to choose from in the shower. Amenities were lovely.   Grounds and pool: the Grand Hyatt is massive- 17.6 hectares! The gardens are…"
5,Wonderful resort with friendly staff made my family visit more that what I expected.  We are taken care by super helpful Manager (Bu Ninik) and Ibu Rina while we were enjoying the resort.  Can't wait to be back soon.
4,"Good place to stay for holiday with fam or couple, the food is good. the room is clean. The thing matter for me is between lobby to the room little bit too far and must walk and the car park so small near lobby"
5,"Beautiful accommodation and grounds. Staff are amazingly attentive, polite and helpful. Special mention to Bridget at the breakfast garden cafe, Urgo in the lounge bar and Made Dwipayana who made our stay extra special. We had a fabulous time and couldn’t recommend the Grand Hyatt Bali highly enough. We had a fantastic club suite which offered spacious accommodation for our two week stay, as a family. "

After arriving at the lobby,  My family and I met Mr. Caludio who's explained us regarding our 'day pass' package and escorted us to their main pool. He was also registered my sister for Hyatt Member, hence we earned points for our lunch.   Talking about Italian food ,  Salsa Verde is the best. The staff Mrs. Merry, and Tutik also Ms. Desi were very helpful.   Thank you for this wonderful vibes Grand Hyatt Bali!"

Such great staff!  Thanks to Ngurah, Agus, Sukasana and all your colleagues  Had a great time there!  Nadia"
5,"Immaculate hotel, fantastic friendly staff and the best food and facilities in all the hotels in nusa dua. The kids slide is a winner and the lagoon pool system is perfect for floating around in all day. The hotel is huge but it also feels intimate. The food is exceptional, especially salsa verde restaurant. 10/10!! "
5,"My wife and I spent 7 nights here. The Grand Hyatt Bali property is 31 years old and still one of the most beautiful, manicured Hyatt properties in our travels, Oh wait, Hyatt Yogyakarta (Borobudur) is also one of the most beautiful Hyatt properties, plus Yogyakarta has a executive 9 hole golf course, so Grand Hyatt Bali & Hyatt Yogyakarta would be a tie and should be on everyone’s bucket list. My wife has post polio, she is a wheelchair user. We were able to walk/wheel the entire 17 hectare property and access the three pools. A hidden treasure is the Salt Water Balinese pool where we had this pool (4 days) to ourselves. The Garden Restaurant was excellent, Ms Bridget, Ms Toya & others went above and beyond to accommodate us. The entire staff’s kindness and their empathy toward…"
4,"Overall, I spent a few nice days there. Unfortunately, the second restaurant on the beach was closed for renovations. The breakfast/meal could be broader in terms of its selection of western food.   The beach is really very nice, only the vendors can sometimes be a bit annoying. The staff and the surroundings of the hotel are very nice."

5,There’s no way I can describe my experience but I’ll try my best. It’s a stunning property with amazing decor. It’s right next to the beach and Hyatt elites are treated like elites. Breakfast is offered at the garden cafe and is a buffet offering. Globalists are treated to a cocktail and snack offering from 1700-1900 hours.  Special thanks to the GM Amrit Gurung for making our stay ever so special .  Highly recommend this property to anyone staying in Nusa Dua.
5,"We stayed in their Club Executive Suite, a 141 m2 generously sized room. It was aired and cleaned to perfection. Though the resort is decades old, it has been well maintained and much care has gone into upkeep of the place. The entire resort is huge and located right on the beach. Service at the restaurant and hotel was professional, efficient and hospitable. Many staff have been with working for the resort for 20-30 years and knew the place inside out.   The only cons are: 1. The gym is rather small with only a few machines available.  2. Unfortunately, there wasn’t a coffee machine in the suite. Just a kettle, 2 bottles of water and sachets of instant coffee.   Both cons are rather inconsequential and didn’t affect our stay there too much."
5,"Very friendly and professional staff, great service, beautiful garden and pools, large beach… the hotel and rooms are clean and well maintained - a very good choice in Nusa Dua - only one restaurant operating due to current situation, but good choice and quality and prices reasonable"
5,Grand Hyatt Bali is wonderful!  i had some delays getting to Bali and i actually booked the wrong day. Forgot about the 12 hour difference. When I arrived i realized my mistake and asked if i could just change it. Initially they could not i was disapointed but understood.  i sat down to make plans and the reservationist approached me and said they would just allow me to stay on the previous reservation.  I am a Globalist and got upgraded to an amazing room.  I CAN NOT BELIEVE this is a category 1 hotel.  For 5000 points AMAZING. Staff was super friendly and accommodating.  THANK YOU!!  A great large property on the beach!!!

Initially they could not i was disapointed but understood.  i sat down to make plans and the reservationist approached me and said they would just allow me to stay on the previous reservation.  I am a Globalist and got upgraded to an amazing room.  I CAN NOT BELIEVE this is a category 1 hotel.  For 5000 points AMAZING. Staff was super friendly and accommodating.  THANK YOU!!  A great large property on the beach!!!
5,"We chose Grand Hyatt Bali as our quarantine hotel because it was a bubble hotel. This means your quarantined area includes the beach, the swimming pool and a restaurant. Like an all inclusive stay of 3 nights. It was a great way to recover from our jetlag. They offered lots of activities. This resort is highly recommended if there comes a quarantine again. With a bubble hotel…just consider it your beach holiday within the holiday.  I would like to get the negatives out of the way first.  Reservation of the package was quite an hassle. Being understaffed due to covid was difficult to get in touch and finalize the booking. Also the changing and new regulations for bali made everything quite confusing. But the staff of GH including Claudio and esspecially Emily Kakoo were amazing.…"
5,"It was a great experience. Grand Hyatt Bali is just beautiful. The gardens are like a dream and the beach is very well kept. It looks like sort of wild although, as a I said, but it is very well kept and you can find sun beds in the beach line but at the same time you do not feel that you are in the typical hotel beach. There are many beautiful Bali trees so you can watch the sea from your sun bed enjoying the sea breeze and their shadow. We had access to Club Lounge and I highly recommend it. They are always very generous in terms of quantity of food. To short cut we had a good time. We live in Jakarta and we have been to Bali more than 5 times and always to Hyatt. Either to Grand Hyatt Bali or to Grand Hyatt Regency. We always try to GO GRAND!, as their slogan goes. Muchas…"
5,"Its been a long time since we stayed here, but it was an easy choice for the first few days of isolation. Took 3 hrs for our regular pcr to come through Friendly staff Great gardens A lot of the restaurants are closed,but the italian restaurant was open seving indo/ italian/pasta pizza and it waas cheap and very good. Drinks were reasonably priced. Restaurant was clean  Whilst we were there a small conference setting up for g20 were there. Great value  Would stay again"
5,"Grand Hyatt Bali was always my family first choice for stay while at Bali, located at the Nusa Dua beach, have river pool, spacious room, amazing breakfast and the most of all well maintain garden with ponds really make us very refreshing "
1,"I was having refreshment at the Veranda Lounge and Bar at this hotel and left my glasses. Return to lounge asking for my glasses but the stuff are so clueless and unhelpful. She said she dont find my glasses, and I told her ask her colleague and lost & found dept because someone might find it.  She did it and told me that they dont have my glasses there either. Then I asked her, shouldnt you ask my phone number for future follow up?? Just after that she write it on restaurant bill. There is no form or anything.  DOES SHE EVEN KNOW THE PROCEDURE?? I am not even sure she will kept my phone number or follow up this matter seriously. If it some cheap random hotel I would understand with such services. But this? In hyatt? You lost my trust! Shame on you! This hotel will be the last…"

1,"Choose Other hotel on this area. I love staying at nusa dua area, never tried hyatt before so i did try and WILL NOT RECOMMEND this..   First, They charged whole bill once i arrive plus open my credit card, which btw i booked through booking.com. This never happens  Second I booked 2 rooms with ocean view. I requested for ground floor because i have parent with me, they said it full and i saw it was empty when i go through it after i went to the beach. Plus they put me at far end of the building. Staff said i can stay in ground floor but downgraded to garden view  Third i asked them to change for connecting room, room beside me was empty.  it took sooo long for them to do something what they called room inspection, (which when i do check in, i heard lady angry due to this room…"
1,"Can not recommend! Average responds from reception staff, check in as executive guests very slow, check out even more worse, even we paid our room in advance! Can’t recommend this place. Terima kasih."
4,"I had stayed here for 3 nights in the quarantine  bubble and then I moved to the main hotel for one night. Overall the stay was very pleasant, I had a wonderful time exploring the hotel as I was not able to go elsewhere. The hotel is walking distance to the beach which was so nice, can relax on the sunbed and have a few drinks. The staff is very attentive, however, as the food was taken from the main restaurant it can take up to 30 mins for your food to arrive, with the view at the restaurant the wait was manageable. However the food was average.. The hotel property itself was very beautiful, big swimming pool, not a lot of clients, ATM so a lot of privacy and can really relax. The walk around the hotel is very nice as it is surrounded by either with ponds with koyfish, a pool,…"
5,"I was staying for only one night on the 7th of March,  but it was already amazing. The place is iterally an enitere Bali in to one area. The room was great and feel very homey. However, when I turn on the bathtub, there was yellow color coming out as if it was not used after a long time. I understand since it’s the panedemic.   Also, the staffs were very welcoming and friendly as expected, with me and other guests. Thank you, Jeni from the Reception, it was nice talking to you. I hope you get the recogntion you deserve in your career.   The kirya spa was very relaxing with their their services and their warm stones. The Salsa Verde foods were delicious, honestly the best Restaurant ever! The portion was huge which is perfect for the price, very well worth it. The best nasi…"
5,"The staff was wonderful, the food as well. The hotel it self is beautiful and the beach right out side you can go surfing some good waves. Thank you so much everybody er Grand Hyatt Bali Nusa Dua. Just start your booking at ones.   Great wishes for the future 🤙🏻"

2,Only very old and slow employees. 15 to 30 mn waiting to get a table for each meal. I asked.for toothpaste.. It took 4 hours to get it to my room. Buildings start to look old and out of fashion. Swimming pool around the slide area very smelly. Not very enjoyable overall experience and very far from a fancy place for a 5 star hotel. 
5,"Agustinus, sutrisna, Argo, widarma, rai, dessy and evy; provided us an amazing service and experience during our quarantine, they were so kind with us and also helpfully, 100% recomended if you’re planning to do your quarantine in the Grand Hyatt; Terimah kasih  guys 💜"
5,All names listed above made us feel so much at home and was great! Thanks so much everyone. Everyone was such a great help and was amazing to see such smiling faces no matter how much pressure they were under pressure
5,"We have been there 4 nights during our quarantine in Bali. The food was amazing, there was nothing we ordered and didn’t like, everything was super good. The hotel itself was clean and everyone tried to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The staff is very friendly, helpful and always in a good mood. All of them always happy to help with a smile on their face but especially Rina, Dessi, Widiasa and Ari were amazing people and we were happy to meet them during our stay. The private hotel beach was also very clean, perfect for kids to play as there are a lot of trees providing some shade.   Everything was perfect and I would definitely come back when I am in Bali again."
5,"The hotel is magnificent; you can easily do social distancing, as the hotel is very huge. In front of the hotel, there is a long beach with white sands. You can take a nice stroll along the beach or bike riding. The hotel is very tropical, has many nice gardens, many birds, and ducks. Children love them. There are many swimming pools, with fun slides and outdoor whirlpools. It is the ultimate resort. Our Grand Executive Suite is 141-sqm. It is large and has a great view of the garden and ocean. Our family loves it. The room is big, clean, and homey. It is perfect for travelling with your family. It is perfect for long stay as well. Special thanks to Mr. Gurung, who had assisted us and showing great care to his guests. He is friendly and always ensuring the satisfaction of his…"

3,"For me, grand hyatt was the first hotel when i came first visiting bali. Its 20yrs ago. And magically the room and furniture model its just the same as 20yrs ago.  But they maintain very well, no dust complaints from me that having dust allergies. We’ve got the junior suite room, and huge! Unfortunately some how the check in process were taking very long time to prepare. Almost 3 hours! So we’ve got drink complimentary at lounge, visiting kids club and we went to the beach since it take years to get a room.   That night we’ve ordered room dining, and it takes very long time. Our food were getting cold when arrived to our room, since the hotel complex very big. We need almost 10 minutes walk from room to hotel it self if we ordered gofood or grab food.  The beach were nice and…"
5,"Its been a very pleasant stay with Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua, especially with excellent hospitality, all the other staffs also very helpful and attentive. Our kids love the pools and kids activity, our parents love the spa experience. Will definitely come back to Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua again!"
4,"Had an opportunity to finally have a short break from all the covid thing last year. Stay at this place, got a room with a pond view on the ground level room, a bit far than what we prefer since i brought my parents who can't walk far, but well no rooms available due to the pandemic conditions that the hotel only open one side of the complex. Overall the room was good, spacious, but the service is a bit slow (maybe due to short staff during covid-19 conditions), req for extra blanket on the check in day but have to remind them again the next day. The room service food was good, but the breakfast menu just so so, the waiters did not have all the knowledge about the menu, i asked for some food name in the menu for the ingredients they can't answer it and have to check it with the…"
5,"Such a wonderful, relaxing stay. The hotel is very well maintained and spotlessly clean. The pools, beach and restaurants are beautiful. The staff are extremely friendly, attentive and good at what they do. The room was lovely and the atmosphere was very peaceful."

5,"Enjoyable stay, complemented by excellent service throughout by staffs who show genuine willingness to “go the extra miles” in every part of the service for all guests. Given the size of the property, we often had to ask for directions & every single time the staffs would not just point to the right directions but took the efforts to escort & walk us to the destinations without being asked."
5,"Probably the only hotel that makes me feel like home. 2 days doesnt seemed enough for us to enjoy all facilities or even walk the area. The hotel is huge!  The room, the landscape, the friendly services from all staff especially Claudio who has been extremely helpful from beginning.  Hats off to him for making sure our honeymoon's memorable. He set up our room beautifully and welcomed my wife with fresh flower and welcomed me with delicious chocolate cake just to be fair. Our baggages came later at night (around 10.30) and we did request the reception to have it delivered to our room. But to our surprise, Claudio showed up with our baggages instead. (Pretty sure he carried them baggages himself. No buggy.) Such an extra miles from him.  "
4,Had a wonderful stay in Grand Hyaat Bali. Staff is very helpful and welcoming.  The covid protocol were good . The beach is beautiful. The property is well kept. We had good time staying with family and friends 
5,The hotel is huge! My room was like in the middle of a jungle! Very exciting. I love it. Very relaxing. The room was big with beautiful balinese ensemble! The beach is nice. My favorite thing is ofcourse the breakfast. They serve the best croissant I've ever eaten. Rich!
5,"Old hotel but complete facility..great swimming pool, water slide for kids, large day bed, clean private beach..but old room interior and breakfast not so many variety..but overall always enjoy my stay in Grand Hyatt..Thank you Grand Hyatt :)"

5,"The Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua is absolute beach front with amazing golden sands.  Our room was on the top floor and we had views of the sea which was amazing.  The room we had was a King with a day bed and a balcony.  It was perfect for us, my wife and I and our 13 month old.  The hotel supplied a crib.  The bathroom is quite big, the bonus was a wardrobe area which was big enough to also store our luggage.  The Breakfasts were very good and the staff attentive, as they were pretty much anywhere you go at the Hyatt.  The pools were very clean as were the grounds.  A very nice place to stay and we would definitely return. "
5,My wife and I just spent 7 glorious days at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua.  What a stunning  and beautiful resort this is. It was more than I hoped for.  The suite accomodation was very comfortable.  The staff and service was excellent.  We plan to visit again next year.
3,"At first, we had high hopes for this particular Hyatt but they’re not quite ready for an influx of guests. We decided to upgrade our room, and it wasn’t communicated to the next shift. We waited two hours for our room, only to be sent to the wrong room. Our room was ill-prepared. We didn’t have enough of anything for our family of four- not enough towels, not enough cotton buds, not enough drinking glasses… the sink faucet was broken and canted, and the shower did not drain well. Slippers are given “on demand.”   The next day, we had early morning plans, and as we were drifting off to sleep, past 9 pm, room service called to ask us to pay for dinner! We were sleeping. Apparently they don’t allow guests to charge to the room??!? I have no idea what was going on, but it really…"
4,"This was our first trip during the pandemic. It was a little different experience compared to pre pandemic but still a memorable experience. A few feedback to consider, no room sandal, limited room amenities, breakfast was the same everyday. However, we understand that this was due to covid, because it was never like this pre 2020. Despite all of those, absolutely no complaints beach was excellent, pool was great, room was clean and tidy, would definitely be back for more great experience at Grand Hyatt Bali."
2,"Check in process so slow, check in area very Hot, old room and toilet not clean. Room services slow response, TV not working at first time and have waited for technician. At noon, room quite warm despite full AC"

4,"When my husband and I decided to go to Bali we saw they had a Grand Hyatt and decided to stay there due to the fact we trust their name. This was an exceptional stay, the hotel was beautiful (but bit outdated) inside. Our room was very clean and the staff went out of their way to make us feel at home and that was incredible I must say."
4,"Great and friendly staff, great facilities - especially the pool. Awesome.  Design and decor (room and surrounding) a bit dated. Lobby is awesome. Staff are really helpful in helping and assisting the guests. "
5,"Great ambience, variable breakfast menus, friendly staff, awesome private beach, and full-hearted service. This 5 star hotel gives quality time satisfaction to us. Definitely will come back with the whole family here. "
5,"Overall, it was very pleasant stay even after sometimes coming back to Grand Hyatt Bali. There are 3 things for this review.  First, the hotel staff was the star of the show. They are all very friendly and caring for the wellbeing of the guest. Thanks to all of them.  Second, the facilites. This hotel provides very wide range of facilites to pamper every guest coming to this hotel. They have a very good restaurants, good fitness center, in house clinic, marvelous spa facilities, great tennis courts and of course many stunning swimming pools.  Despite the age of the property, it is a very well maintained resort property arround the area with beautiful garden, great beach overlooking indian ocean, and of course the well maintained rooms.  All in all, my stay at Grand Hyatt Bali…"
1,"#1. Stray dogs inside the Grand Hyatt hotel. Barking, chasing people. Even at the kindergarten area. We even saw dogs drinking the water of the swimming pool. The dogs are urinating and defecating everywhere. You cannot walk barefoot. They are also running on the beach. Disgusting and dangerous. I am attaching pictures. You can check them.  #2. The breakfast area is incredibly noisy. The management (Andre) puts a electronic music very loud. The staff does not ask guests to respect the social etiquette. Guests come with their cell phone and start to do face time while eating very loud, they literally yell. They watch their TV on their phone at full volume next to you. The staff is slow and barely speaks English. A nightmare every morning.  #3. The aircon does not work. The air…"

The dogs are urinating and defecating everywhere. You cannot walk barefoot. They are also running on the beach. Disgusting and dangerous. I am attaching pictures. You can check them.  #2. The breakfast area is incredibly noisy. The management (Andre) puts a electronic music very loud. The staff does not ask guests to respect the social etiquette. Guests come with their cell phone and start to do face time while eating very loud, they literally yell. They watch their TV on their phone at full volume next to you. The staff is slow and barely speaks English. A nightmare every morning.  #3. The aircon does not work. The air…"
5,"Overall is excelent. Staff is friendly and helpfull, room is clean, nice garden, and the most favorite the pool is very nice. It's very worth it for my quality time with family. Can wait for the next staycation here.  "
5,"The best located hotel in Nusa Dua with the largest territory and the longest beachline. Immaculate service, caring personnel and management. Recommended for a family vacation. Gourmet breakfasts and a hi-level italian-meditarranean restaurant overlooking the ocean. "
4,"Stayed here with family  for vacation. I originally book grand room but was upgraded to executive suite. The rooms were clean, staff are friendly. Great SOP for health protocol for preventing covid 19. We love the breakfast the most , especially the french toast and croissant.  The Salsa Verde dining is delicious and reasonably price.  Personally I feel a bit dark at night, the rest is good. "
4,"Hotel area was reaaaally huge, it took more than 10 minutes to walk from lobby area to our room. Room was comfortable but had a bit of weird old scent when we entered it. I love how close our room was to the pool and beach. As it was located in Nusa Dua, they have their own beach area so it was indeed serene. Breakfast buffet was amazing! However they changed the buffet to ala carte the next day, and to me somehow the food wasn't as great. Before checking out, I requested bell boy service to the room and waited for some time and they never came so I needed to carry 2 heavy suitcases all the way to lobby in the middle of the day! It ain't a big problem anyway but kinda wished they notified me first if no one was available and didn't make me wait."
5,"Nice, clean room Beautiful scenery beside the beach, clean and safe swimming pool Great breakfast choices Great services from check in until check out Safety using health protocol for preventing covid 19"

5,Nice to place to get the peace and relax time after the exhausted working days...i didn't expect to stay in such place until i arrived there and found some friendly staffs and stayed for a couple of days (a week)...😊
5,"Stayed here with 2 friends, they upgraded our room to a suite. Love the spacious bathroom with a big tub, 2 showers, and 2 toilets. We had a pond in our backyard.  I personally love the breakfast the most, especially the pancake/waffle station. Ibu Dewi was really kind and helpful—all the staffs are angels though. And I love how they employed older people.  If there’s anything to improve, I’d suggest fixing the concierge web chat. I don’t think it’s working."
5,"  (+): the resort is kids friendly. Swimming pools are awesome & has 2 water slides, my kids super love it. (+): the staff are super nice and friendly (+): beach is clean and not crowded (-): but local seller can enter, personally i'm a bit bothered by this (-): breakfast is so-so (-): a bit dark at night"
4,"Nice place to stay for short escape with the family. Huge resort and lots of activities spot. Need improvement on mosquito control, specially because lots of pond and plantpot inside the hotel. The staff and service was excellent. Breakfast menu just nice. The Le Petit Chef dinner is extraordinary, two thumbs up."
5,I stayed in Hyatt Nusa Dua for 3 days and 2 nights. I booked a Grand room but they upgraded my room to Suite room which has kitchen and living room. Overall it was amazing service and hospitality. I will definitely stay here again

5,"Overall, I am highly satisfied with the service provided by Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua and I am looking forward to stay there again. Staffs are very friendly, kind and helpful. The best thing is, during this covid 19 pandemic, they provide the private clinic located down the lobby to do the antigen test and it is very helpful for the one who wants to fly with a plane because we are required to do antigen at least 1 x 24 hours before the flight. Also, the breakfast was delicious as expected, the room service was fabulous (my wife and I ordered burger and nasi goreng). In addition, the pool was amazing but unfortunately I didn’t have a chance to swim there because I only spent 3 days in Bali :( hopefully I’ll be able to stay longer in grand hyatt nusa dua and try the fabulous swimming…"
5,"We recently went to the Grand Hyatt Bali for our Wedding Anniversary, as it is a special place for us. We were greeted well on arrival and all staff, throughout our stay, were very respectful and welcoming.   It was a great vacation and we look forward to returning "
5,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. The assigned room was very far from the pool but they had no issue to move us closer. The room and bathroom was clean and spacious.  The food is delicious and reasonably priced.  We live in Bali but love to come here for a day visit. The staff is so friendly and helpful. Beautiful pools, comfy white beach towels and clean sunloungers"
5,"great for family with kids especially the executive grand suite room. very spacious and great for family. no complain regarding the room or service, very recommended place despite it’s old age. dont come here if you expect the new modern fancy hotel. it is definitely a classic one and it’s great"
5,"Grand Hyatt is not a new hotel, but is very good hotel.  Very good personality staff hotel (all staff from security, front desk, restoran staff (inc chef), until cleaning service). Clean beach, good view. "

5,"It was an easy decision for us to go back to Grand Hyatt Bali, we have stayed there numerous times and have always had an amazing time. It's definitely a family-friendly resort, where the kids can go out to play in the pool or beach, and the parent can just sit back and relax. The staff are very friendly and treat everyone with gentle care. I do want to give a shout out to Ms. Fenny, who have always been very helpful to me. Whether it was for a business trip or family vacation, she always help me and make sure to check on me, whether its a ""hi how are you"" or "" can I help you with anything else"", it really does  makes a huge different to my overall experience.  Thank you Hyatt!!"
5,Excellent service and food. The hotel area is great. The beach is so clean. The staffs all are so friendly and helpful. Had a pleasant stay. Will definitely come back. Perfect for family staycation....
5,"Higly recommend Thde Grand Hyat Bali because the cost are cheap, get a nice room, good food, good service, a very large swimming pool and can enjoy a very wide beach atmosphere, good room cleanliness, friendly hotel staff"
5,"Service problem adresing and breakfast werry exclusive profesional and definetly well managed.... We even got a discount and upgrade due to covid times, wich is great for the tough times....good woork team and keep up the exelent woork ...."
5,"Good - Massive complex beautifully landscaped  - Probably the longest private beachside in Bali + white sand beach + nice water with mild waves  - All the things you expect from a 5 star resort are there (gym, pool, kids club, activities)  - Very friendly and attentive staff  - one of the best breakfast I have ever tried in Bali  - reasonably pricing on room, food, spa etc   Bad - old room condition - nothing else I can think of "

5,"Lovely time with my family in this beautiful resort! We visited Grand Hyatt Bali for a daypass and had such a great time, the food was delicious and it’s so relaxing to spend some time by the pool, their river pool is fantastic with a beautiful landscape and water slide!! Will definitely come back soon :)"
4,"It’s our 2nd time staying here. First time was 15 years ago. Property is very well maintained. Seems rooms are all renovated. We love the firm mattress, very good for our back. We were upgraded to suite room. We truly love it. We love that the room has working area and proper dining area. Lovely stay and love the beach. Could walk along the entire nusa dua beach  Breakfast was really good. Healthy freshly squeezed fruits and vegetables juice. They were all delicious and sufficient varieties. We love that they have daily breakfast along with their classic ones. Really delicious!  Would be better if some of the activities such as bicycles riding can be freely used by the guests. Think the guests need to pay hourly basis.   Definitely recommended and would return! "
5,"The manager on duty was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The hotel was very nice. The female manager really helped us a lot, she made sure that our stay was unforgetable - in a good way. Thank you very much for your excellent hospitality."
5,We chose Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua because we had stayed there many times in the past.   We had not been there for a while but found this time the place was still terrific.   Staff provided outstanding service during a period of heightened covid exposure in Indonesia.  Staff was wonderful and made it a highly enjoyable stay.   We would certainly recommend it to anyone.
4,"Such a good experience. Good ambience, nice room, super clean and comfortable Worth to stay The service is so nice and veru helpful Good job grand hyatt bali Will come back soon and recommend to my fellas "

5,"We stayed at the hotel several times in the past.  The hotel is really good for family vacationing.   The staffs are customer oriented and focused on making your stay memorable.  All hotel chains may claim that they are ""customer oriented"", but saying and actually showing is very different.  We had stayed at other hotel chains where we felt like the staffs were robots and focused much more on hotel's overall benefit and regulation than satisfying customers and making them feel welcomed and watched out for.  Sometimes people, hotel/staff, need to know that bending a rule gives optimal outcome for everyone (Hotel, staff, and customer).  We never had any negative experience in our past stays, including this one.  We always felt staffs are going out of their way to make our stay…"
5,Stayed at one of the Suites with kids. This hotel remain well maintained during pandemic time compared to other 5 stars resort. Breakfast was good. Definitely one of our favourite hotel everytime we visit Bali. 
5,"Been around the world. Been in so many 5 stars hotels and resorts incl. Hyatt facilities … that 24 days was our best experience.   Everybody treated us beyond our wildest expectation. Two thumbs up may not be enough.  Amrit Gurung, Ayu Trisna, Andre - The F&B Director and all Grand Club staffs … they are the best !!!  A good place if you want to find your “second home” during your vacation "
5,"For the room upgrade, for the beautiful fruit arrangement in the room, for the small cakes, for the beach sarong, for the friendly staff, for sanitizing the bathroom so often, for the bike rental WITH kids seat, for the extraordinary pools, for keeping bunnies in the kids club, THANK YOU!"
5,"It was a great experience stay in Grand Hyatt Bali with Family. Kids was very Happy with the Lagoon Pool and the Water Slide, otherwise the beach is very beautiful with the Peninsula View. Try Snorkeling around the beach, Kids find some beautiful red starfish around  Next kids was cycling around nusadua and sawagan beach, its was fun for them Staff was very Friendly, Great Hospitality. Fabulous room, classic balinese room with lotus pond"

4,"It's a great place to stay. I really would like to appreciate to Mr. Amrit and Ibu Zenya for the upgrade room.  So many open air in the hotel, so that the risk of covid-19 infection should be very low. I suggest to give more option of food for breakfast.  Keep it up !"
5,"The hotel is very family friendly, beachfront, with 3 large pools and lots of facilities. The room comes with excellent breakfast, and the service was nice. I also enjoyed cycling along the beach and enjoy their beautiful gardens."
5,"The resort is really beautiful, surrounded by flowers and lotus ponds everywhere we passed. Every room has a beautiful view of their garden. The hotel is really big, and it took us around 7 minutes to walk from the lobby.  They have some swimming pools, and beautifully designed with some caves. They also have a long slide at the pool which is really fun.  Their fitness center has complete equipment and has several rooms for different exercises we need.  Breakfast was served in a buffet and has various choices of menu.  My daughter loves the kids club very much, they have 2 different places of kids club. Toddler club and kids above 3 years old club.  The hotel has access to the Nusa Dua beach. The sands were clean and soft, and the beach was really quiet. We can also rent a bike…"
4,This is like other Hyatt places  Land is huge beach not as good as expected. The water is quite far out. Tide was low all the time. The hotel was nearly empty all the time we were there becuase of lockdown situation which was good but also a bit lonely

4,"we are staying at here after their re opening during the pandemic, good protocol hotels, we got upgraded to the executive suites which is very nice and spacious give everyone space to work and to do school online. The property is well taken care of despite the previous closing....good job... The beach is nice and quiet very relaxing, you can have morning walk in the pathways too. We just wish the other pool by the beach is open so people not crowded in the sliding pool.  Recomended place to stay during this pandemic. "
2,"We are dissapointed with our stay in Grand Hyatt Bali. We booked direct for 2 nights. When you enter the Hotel, The lobby and entrance is so Grand.  But that when it stop. The room we were assigned was old and got problem with AC.  It was hot. I asked to move to different room and the AC was slightly better ONLY. We decided not to extend our stay in Grand Hyatt.   Other big Major issue was the main pool maintenance. It was closed during our 2 nights there. Imagine all the guests need to share the smaller pool provided ( NOT RECOMMENDED IN COVID Situation )   I hardly swam as everytime We want to swim, there just to much crowd. Also the lagoon pool is very dirty, Many Algae underneath.   The positive side is the breakfast is OK and overall service is excellent "
5,This hotel is very clean. and also they have Child pool & private Swimming pool behind the Gym. which i really like. there are also some Tenis Court in the gym. i book my Room at agoda. it have 1 big bed and also 1 free Bed on the other side of the bed which allow my nephew to sleep there. The breakfast is also good but sometimes. it was crowded.
5,"- The room is clean - It has a private beach, which we can see the sunrise from there. - The staffs are very helpful and friendly to cater to our needs. - The hotel has a kid club. - The hotel location also close to water blow so we can walk approximately 15-20 minutes there.  Overall, it's really nice to stay there."
3,"room cleanliness can be improved, breakfast menu could have more variation, room remodeling will be great (very 90' right now, though it is near impossible to do this during this covid time), beach is dirty (before covid is always clean) , local souvenir seller are still on the beach ( are they vaccineated? ) makes me very uncomfotable."

5,Hotel is in great Condition with very Friendly Staff that also ensures the Covid 19 measures are higly implemented.. Highly recommend for Families with Kids below 10 years old as the Kids Club is excellent.
4,"The rate is adjusting in pandemic time. Just 1 tower of hotel is opened. After a long period closed, the smelled of room is so humid. Lot of facilities is closed or the schedule is changed. So quite, because the guest is rarely.  "
5,"Everything so nice, so cozy, and the staff very friendly, breakfast so delish, the room clean and tidy. It was beautiful experience to stay in this hotel, but for me the bed is quite firm i prefer more fluffly bed, but everything is wonderful"
5,It was a pleasant stay at Grand Hyatt Bali for us. Even during the pandemic we were assured of their safety measures. Staff are all very helpful and practiced excellent service. I booked 2 ocean view rooms and stayed for 3 nights. Among the travelling parties were a 15 months and an eldery. We had a good time there. I think its just lacking the lively atmosphere since the acale of the property is huge and too little guests during our stay.
5,"This was our 1st time staying in Grand Hyatt and we weren't disappointed. Despite there was  a glitch during check-in that was being handled smoothly by Ms. Cynthia, we had lots of fun in Grand Hyatt Bali. We stayed for 4D5N by purchasing e-voucher from Hyatt Online (with a very good bargain too!). The Grand Room was perfect for 2 adults and 2 kiddos (age 9yo). the kids were so excited to sleep on the extra day bed in the special corner of the room. It's like their own private space. The garden around the hotel was astoundingly well kept... the beach was so amazing with beautiful white sands. The pools , especially with the water slide was a favorite for my kiddos. We spent hours swimming , lounging by the pool ,  and play the water slide for the whole afternoon . A special…"

The Grand Room was perfect for 2 adults and 2 kiddos (age 9yo). the kids were so excited to sleep on the extra day bed in the special corner of the room. It's like their own private space. The garden around the hotel was astoundingly well kept... the beach was so amazing with beautiful white sands. The pools , especially with the water slide was a favorite for my kiddos. We spent hours swimming , lounging by the pool ,  and play the water slide for the whole afternoon . A special…"
5,"Overall, my family and I  had a great experience with the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua, one of our favorite hotel to stay in Bali. Staff was incredibly helpful, and the amenities were great. The room was wonderful, clean, and the breakfast was outstanding! Dont forget to try their pina colada! hehehe"
5,The hospitality was provided as much as expected. The food was excellent. Staffs were friendly amd helpful. Recommended hotel for staycation in couple days during covid19. Health Protocol for sure implemented well in this hotel.
5,"My first honeymoon in Bali  2011 was at this hotel, bring back all the good memories, now we're back with 2 kidos and still fun to stay there.. hope this pandemic will gone very soon so the business will back stronger.. I think the TV should change to smart one so kids can enjoy too"
5,"We bought a voucher on Grand Hyatt Bali's instagram shop for 1 night stay, breakfast included, and Le Petit Chef dinner experience for two. Grand Hyatt Bali is probably one of the best hotels we've stayed out in all our travels! We were blessed with a free upgrade to an ocean view room which overlooked the pool in the front and the ocean to our right and it was beautiful. Everything in the room was great, including the free cookies and fruit we got as a loyalty member. The room was spacious, tv had loads of English channels, there was a lot of cupboard space for clothes and bags and the bath had a window with a view. The only downside for us was that the shower was in the same room as the bath, so it was like a wet room. We prefer to have an enclosed shower. But it was not a big…"
5,"Excellent Service Well Maintained Facilities Best pool design and fun (water slide) Best beach (soft sands) Friendly and genuine staffs Ate Breakfast like kings. Love the corn fritters, eggs menu and croissants."

4,"We spent 2 nights here during for the New Year's Eve Festivities. We took up our friend's Guest of Honor offer for 1st night as he's a Hyatt Globalist, and we were only holding a mere Explorist status. We decided to extend another night with cash paid through the front desk.   As for the following night that we paid on our own to extend our stay, the downgrade to the Deluxe room felt harsh. Apart from the good insider rate that included breakfast (on a peak New Year Holiday), a welcome fruit platter and the extension of a 4pm late check out, the benefits of a Hyatt Explorist elite ends there.  Traveling as a couple, we tend to enjoy the intimate experiences we get from smaller boutique properties. Having said that, we did celebrate the New Year with a bang at a large resort such…"
4,Have been to GH Bali many times over the years and we always enjoy returning for a pleasant stay. Such a dichotomy....On one hand so peaceful and relaxing this time without all the foreign despite my being a foreigner visiting from Jakarta but also equally as sobering and sad to see the economic collapse of so many small to medium sized business in the destination
3,"I stayed in Hyatt Nusa Dua for 2 days and it was quite unpleasant experience. Despite it located in prestigious area of Nusa Dua and already predicated as one of top world chain hotel, I guess the property doesn’t maintain its status really well. I can start with how the hotel management doesn’t prepare facilities as much as it should. The spa is closed, and there is no one day order service for services. Pool and also others facilities are not functioning well and there is no clear sign for guest where we to go cause most of all are closed.  The reception service and room service are not agile yet, not forget to mention how we brought all of our luggage from the room to the lobby area (promised bell boy didn’t come right on time, and the reception line is busy)  Overall, I…"
3,I stayed in grand hyatt bali recently the rooms are very old styled. Need to renovate asap. And provide a buggy to drop visitors to the room as it a very long walk to the room. Other amenities was fine 
5,"for my last trip in 2020 i chose the grand hyatt bali as a retreat and it was the perfect choice. The hotel is perfectly prepared for covid and the i felt very safe. Also the beach at nusa dua was a dream, only the room safe was not working properly. Everything else was perfect"

5,"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali Nusa Dua for five nights. It was a very pleasant stay. I really want to thank Grand Hyatt Bali for giving us an upgrade when I arrived at the property.  Everything was pleasant. They have a very friendly and genuine staffs which is a very good assets for the company, especially most of them have been working from 90's.  Though this resort was built in 90's, it is a very well maintained resort arround the area. The resort has a very well maintained lush and green garden, with many ponds, pools and birds stays arround their greens.  The breakfast was exceptional, especially during this pandemic. They provided full range of buffet breakfast with a good pandemic health protocols.  Overall, I want to say this is one of the best resort in Bali. Of…"
5,"Currently staying at the property. After 10 months stayed at home we decided to have a week of ""safe and quiet- away from it all"" anniversary holiday. We chose Grand Hyatt for its massive property, facilities and its exclusive location. They exceed our expectation. .  This hotel has it all for my family of two and a toddler, the animals big and small, the playground, the water slide, the pools, the jacuzzi, the ponds, the beach, the garden, the jog track and most likely I will also love the kids club (open on 20th if Im not mistaken).   Although the property is old and there are bits of here and there needed to be fix in our room, I come to appreciate the tackfulness of the staff in handling our complains. Everyone is friendly, courteous and so professional, it is the highlight…"
5,"We visited the hotel as a part of a family vacation to Bali- we covered the age demographic from 5 years old to 76 years old. The hotel exceeded our expectations significantly, in terms of the setting, the service, the location, and the overall experience.   We stayed in the Club rooms, and I can't recommend them highly enough. The club lounge is great- surrounded by koi ponds, with an exclusive pool area, and excellent breakfast/cocktail hours. The beach is quiet and exclusive, and the hotel is walking distance from the shopping complex which is very convenient.   The service stands out- everyone was friendly, courteous, and helpful."
5,"We went with 2 young children. We had ana amazing time, the weather , location and the facilities were amazing. This was such a relaxing holiday.  Special shout out to the kids club and our baby sitter sue who was amazing.  If you want a grand entrance and warm welcome for your family come here."

3,"Pros •	Long stretch of beautiful clean sandy beach •	Big hotel with lush greens & beautiful landscape •	Maintenance is not too bad considering the huge area •	Tight security & convenient in Nusa Dua •	Great location- you can just walk to the shops/ pharmacy across  Cons •	Aging hotel with dated furnishing (it adds to the character though) •	Not all restaurants were open (pandemic season?) •	Some part of the pool was closed- under maintenance (the smaller slide) •	Kids club did not have many engaging activities- yet is chargeable, staff were unhelpful •	Bathroom is huge - gets flooded by design when you shower. Super slippery - so be careful.  Anyhow- because we got a suite, we had two restrooms in the room and it was separated from the shower so it did not bother us much.  It…"
2,"This hotel is good for kids! But for parents it’s expensive and lacking quality. Impossible to get a drink by the pool, food is terrible quality. Cheap and not appetizing. Highly recommend looking into other hotels. The Fairmont at Sanur is amazing!!! "
5,"Perfect for a luxury getaway. Grand resort with excellent service and breathtaking premises. Our room modern, spacious and beautiful. Amazing pools and gardens. Several high-end restaurants offered delicious meals."
5,"We booked a two nights stay at Grand hyatt to celeberate our 10th anniversary. We were coming here after an amazing 4 night stay where we had already experienced the amazing Bali hospitality. Grand Hyatt didnt disappoint us.  Honestly, it didnt start well, when i had go wait for my room, but little did i know that wait was as they were decorating a room for us. We even got gifts from the management. Chef Asheesh prepared a custom off the menu indian meal for us.The food and the cake was as good as it gets.  The resort was huge and there were things to do for everyone. My Kids loved the pool that was away from the sun and had a lazy river setting. My daughter was in love with the duck roaming around. A fantastic experience, we enjoyed every moment there."
3,"We chose grand Hyatt Bali after much consideration over hotels in the area. There is a choice of many resorts on this strip of beach and we chose this one for its beautiful beach, and well known name.   The hotel itself is so tranquil, and surreal, it’s in a beautiful setting and very well kept. I really did enjoy my time here. There are many pools available to enjoy the sun and the beach is not even a short walk away- I would say less.   Having experienced Grand Hyatt Bali- there are a couple of things that would prevent me from booking here again: This hotel is very suitable for family vacation however less so for the younger generation. There are no facilities on the beach except for the sun lounger. No drinks hut, no masseuse, no sun huts to relax in.   We actually found…"

5,"A place that made us feel very welcome with friendly and professional service.  They go above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable.  Location is ideal, with shopping center and a variety of restaurants within walking distance.  Recommend the SPA facility!   Plenty of pools to pick from and the beach is beautiful."
4,This is a fantastic spot in BALI with their own private beach and serene surrounding.  You should remain in the hotel and explore & enjoy its facilities & surrounding at least for 3 days before checking out other places in the island.
5,"Beautiful hotel, so peaceful and stunning gardens and swimming pools. Staff is so friendly and helpful, food is amazing. We had the Grand Club access  which makes all the difference. The hotel is huge and so beautifully located at the beach. Shops and restaurants nearby in the Bali Collection."
4,"We stayed for 8 nights with our children aged 8 & 5 in one of the standard rooms. This room was great as the day bed within room was able to be made into bed which fitted both kids. Rooms were of a good size and very clean.  Hotel grounds were absolutely stunning and very well maintained and clean, including the pool. Our kids loved the pools although we found the lagoon pool a little too warm. Waterslide was a hit and also well maintained. Staff throughout resort were all very friendly and helpful.  Resort is massive but we were lucky to be there in low season and unfortunately at the beginning of the covid-19 crisis (which on another note was managed very well by the hotel) and I would imagine in peak season it would probably be very chaotic and less enjoyable.  The only…"

5,"I am writing to express my gratitude for your food service. I visited Grand Hyaat along with my family and friends to enjoy my holidays. I booked hotel 4 night .  Especially i am writing this mail to say thank to your Indian Speciality Chef Mr. Ashish Jakhmola for providing Finger Lick Indian Food. Your food have definitely won me as one of your permanent customers. The taste of the Indian food was just out of the world. Allow me to say that you made me nostalgic as the food tasted similar to what my mother cooks for me back at home, though this made me miss my home and mother more!  Once again, big thanks to you and your staff for making my trip more distinctive."
5,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. From the moment we arrived and the wonderful gracious welcome they gave us, and the most beautiful reception area. We booked a nine night stay to celebrate our anniversary. Our room was ocean facing, overlooking a vast lily pad pond with resident ducks. The walkways and grounds are maintained to a wonderfully high standard, and the flora everywhere is breathtaking. All the staff are so kind and would do anything for you, to enhance your stay. Breakfasts are amazing, with so many different options, and the buffet staff ensure you are happy. The pool area is great, with great loungers and towels. Food is served poolside, with great quality produce, cooked to order, and delivered to your loungers together with any drinks you want.…"

In my view a place is deemed good and worth remembering only if you yearn to go back as soon as you get a chance, once you reach back home. I found Grand Hyatt, Bali to be exactly that kind of a place. I am writing this feedback after a month from my stay and I think I’m still in awe of how well this property is designed and maintained.  A special mention for Garden Cafe Restaurant and everyone working here, making sure that every visitor has good dining experience. Also, special mention for the Mr. Ashish Jakhmola, Indian Speciality Chef.  I, never expect authentic Indian food taste outside of India. But I was pleasantly surprised how well food preparations were, I can still remember the taste of all the…"
5,"Not our first time staying here but our last stay was almost 9 years ago. The resort is massive with 4 wings (or villages), we got the room on the South Village overlooking the pond on the ground level. Despite its old age, the hotel has been refurbished and still highlights traditional Balinese style but with a modern twist. Absolutely love the main lagoon pool & river pool, the beach area is massive & pretty quiet when we were there. Room is spacious with balcony/terrace & the bathroom is spacious as well with separate shower & tub. Breakfast is served at their Garden Cafe & despite the selections are not as varied as other newer hotels, it is still adequate. Service at the restaurants are great with friendly waiters & Housekeeping staffs kepr our room meticulously clean all…"
3,"The Grand Hyatt Hotel is very well located. I love the pool, proximity to the beach and the staff. However, the food offer at breakfast and the rooms could be upgraded based on the high rates they charge per night.  A massive concern is the fish traps in the lagoons out front of the hotel and the bay to the north of the Grand Hyatt. The fisherman use steel rods to secure the fish straps to the sea bed and the ends poke up just below the surface of the water. A Japanese surfer was impaled at the start of this year and was seriously injured.   The hotels must put pressure on authorities to make the ocean safe, considering this is the amenity that brings the tourism to Bali. Accountability should begin with the biggest benificuary of the tourism dollar. "

5,I spent 6 wonderful days at the Grand Hyatt I was there to just relax and what a place to do it! The staff are all amazing and willing to help the rooms were always clean. This hotel did everything in its power to make my first time in Bali a rememberable one. A huge thank you to the entire staff I will be going back soon
5,"Grand Hyatt Bali offers great service, friendly staff, beautiful scene, convenience to beach and a mall (both in walking distances). The brand Hyatt is not just simply a stay, it is your taste, enjoyment, and experience. Highly recommended."
4,Great resort. Staff very friendly and rooms extremely clean. Absolutely no complaints with the food. And the pool is amazing.  Just very surprised the walls of our our room paper thin. Can hear chairs and foot steps.  Not so nice when it’s 4am in the morning.
3,Stayed four nights with family. The website stated that the place had loads of different restaurants however they were nearly all closed. Kids club costs extra and did not have many activities. Also al yoga etc costs extra as well. The pool area takes over the whole place and makes it hard to walk around. Beach has huge waves and not so child friendly.  The food is however very good! 👌🏼
5,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in late February on a Luxury Escapes voucher, but ugraded to the Grand Club for our last couple of nights.   The hotel is absolutely superb, friendly staff, beautiful grounds, great choice of pools.  Two of the restaurants were closed due to maintenance, we went to the Italian restaurant a couple of times and the meal was really good.  The Grand Club was fantastic. I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt and we are already planning our next trip. Can't wait to go back."

Food was great with many varieties, presentation is top 5 stars, juices were fresh. The room was well-maintained and freshly cleaned, well done HK team Pools are fantastic, and staff were so attentively friendly. Bell-Desk team were also helpful with genuine smiles. The landscape and beach were just fantastic. SMLES...SMILES...SMILES are every corner of the resort. We really enjoyed our stay!"
5,"Beautiful resort!! The ocean is steps away from anywhere within this resort. Beautiful pools scattered throughout. The resort is well laid out and very clean. Our room was spacious and had a balcony overlooking the ocean. There are fantastic restaurants within and the most friendly staff imaginable. We chose the club room access for our stay and I highly recommend it. Breakfast was delicious with so many options available, then in the evening there was small plates and adult beverages! Very pleasant experience."
5,"Such an amazing experience loved the traditional feel within the hotel 😊 we we totally blown away when we 1st arrived at the Grand Hyatt the lobby area was totally incredible 😍 our room was more than what we expected and the pond outside the balcony was amazing ! Very clean and well maintained resort 😊 the spa was totally incredible we loved chilling out in the on the evenings , the pool was amazing the way it all led round was unreal 😊 and number 1 for me was the staff from the moment we stepped foot into your hotel until the moment we said goodbye each and every member of staff were full of smiles and so lovely the customer service was excellent and felt so welcomed and comfortable, breakfast was amazing so much choice and staff always there to help and topping up our…"
3,The hotel complex is huge. Balinese style hotel. Room is spacious. Garden is beautiful and by the ocean. Interesting lounge with open-air style and interesting bar concept. The hotel is well maintained although it is a bit old already. Great selection at the buffet breakfast. 
5,"Can’t recommend highly enough for people which to visit Bali . This hotel is prime example of what exceptional service looks like. Accommodation, resort, location, customer service, Food are all to a highest standards."

The rooms look a bit old, but it’s just charming. The pool area and beach around the hotel is really great. We would for sure stay here again! "
5,Fantastic service and staff are very friendly.. Although clean the resort is showing signs of age.. would be great to have a adult only pool with swim up bar :)  Restaurants were fantastic and families will enjoy this resorts location and interconnecting room options 
4,"My cousin and I have recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali for 2 nights. The hotel is huge consisting of 700 guestrooms located on many low-rise buildings. One morning I went walking by the beach. When I walked back to the hotel using different path, it took me, let's say, 15 minutes to find my room. Of course I did ask hotel staff where my room was located. The good part of getting lost is that I learnt the hotel exterior was beautifully designed and well maintained. There is a big shopping center just opposite to the hotel called Bali  Collection. So it is very convenient. Although Nusa Dua is considered far, we could get taxi easily and the fare from the hotel to Kuta beach was reasonable. In sum, very enjoyable stay. "
2,Myself and my partner booked into grand hyaat for 4 nights it was one of a few hotels we stayed in on our holiday.. ( all were 5 star )   Firstly when we checked in we were escorted to our room no one communicated with us to inform us as to where the breakfast was and the times or any info on the hotel. 5 star ????   We then arrived at our room... i opened the door to a really strong mold smell. The rooms are extremely out dated and old. They are in much need of a revamp!! In my opinion not worth the $250 a night. The manager did assist and move us to a better room.   The next day it was 2:30pm and our room had still not been cleaned or made up ???? 5 star ??   We then went to breakfast and we had to wait in line to be seated at breakfast for a 750 room hotel they have a…
5,The Grand Hyatt Bali exceeded our expectations.  The staff were amazing.  Especially the Manager of the breakfast dining room (I think her name was Roco). Nothing was too much for any staff member. Rooms were awesome. Maybe a little more variety at breakfast when you stay for a while. We will definitely be back.

5,"I did read a lot of reviews prior to booking my Bali accommodation. I settled on the grand Hyatt because of the property facilities and pools as I was traveling with my children 6,7 and 17yo. The reviews suggested the rooms were dated but clean.  I wanted luxury and therefore booked a grand king suite. Check in was quick and efficient and we were kindly upgraded to an executive suite. WOW! My stay was AMAZING. could not fault one single thing. Everything exceeded my expectations. The food was lovely, the staff were courteous, pools were amazing. My family had the best holiday ever! We stayed 8 nights, the beds seemed really hard after 4 but I think that’s with most hotels not being in your own bed. Thankyou so much grand Hyatt. "
5,"I must admit I had my reservations about coming to this hotel after reading the reviews but it was the most amazing resort and I was very impressed. The check in was very professional and quick and we were promptly shown to a fantastic room in the North Village, on the fourth floor with sea views overlooking a massive pond with ducks and birds. We had a king size bed and the bathroom and air conditioning worked well the entire time.  The room was spotless, with clean sheets and towels provided daily. We were on a Luxury Escapes package which provided free cocktails and meals at the various restaurants and there was not one complaint from us at all. Great food and drinks everywhere we ate.  The pools are huge with loads of lounges available all day. Pool staff was attentive and…"
3,"Good facilities for the kids, massive pools, with slides, hotel refurbished, the lobby bar was great.  The only drawback was the buffet restaurant with show, not such a great place for a meal, not so convenient"
4,"First time visiting Bali for our family.  Went for the Ocean view room as the extra cost was not much. In hindsight I’m not sure it makes that much difference with the view. We agreed next time if we stay we would go for a regular room without a view.  If you enjoy serene tropical gardens and architecture, this place is fantastic. They look after the gardens and grounds better than the rooms.  For families with young kids, this resort is quite good. Various pools and 2 slides, my kids wanted to go straight to the pools after breakfast, and we have a lovey pool at home. The pools towards the beach have very warm water in the afternoon though. Too hot for me. The pool at the back under the trees is much cooler.  Breakfast was good. Dinner in Salsa Verde restaurant was pretty good,…"
3,"The pools are wonderful, location is awesome. Great beach and convenience of shopping and resturants. Bluebird taxi rank right outside the entrance. Very happy with the price and quality. There breakfast just needs a little tweeking. Club lounge meals in the afternoon were value for money. "

5,"We loved our 3 night stay as part of our honeymoon. A beautiful hotel which is large but doesn’t feel overcrowded, immaculate grounds and right on the beach. We didn’t eat at the hotel but the restaurants looked lovely. Good air con and spacious rooms. The pools were good, we went to the Balinese pool which is out of the way but very quiet and not as big as the main pool. I would highly recommend staying here."
2,"We arrived at the grand Hiatt and unfortunately I wish we had stayed at the Novotel . The rooms are clean but dated, so nothing too bad but that’s where it ends ... the ladies at the front customer service desk seem to hate their jobs and we even caught one sour faced one rolling her eyes as she escorted some Asian tourists to their room . Our room had nothing but issues , air con broken , missing kettle and toilet which doesn’t flush , but when they repaired the toilet it still flushed red mud water . The pool is a whole other issue ... the water is uncomfortably hot like a bath and the staff at one point yelled at us from across the pool to say hello when we were reading the menu. At the style , quality and price you would expect breakfast included but it isn’t and there are…"
5,"This our first time in Bali and I genuinely don't think we could have picked a better hotel.   The rooms are good, with maid service every day and bedding changed every 3rd day. You could ask for it to be changed daily  but we didn't see the point in asking for something I would never do at home.They are kept clean and had all the extra little touches you could ask for.   We could only afford to come B&B but breakfast was probably one of the biggest buffets you have ever seen and was help yourself, which my husband did happily. There was hot food bacon, chicken sausages, eggs cooked however you wanted, rice, noodles, pancakes, pastries, croissants, muffins, yoghurt, fruit and so much more, unbelievable and all help yourself. The staff were so polite and friendly, you feel like…"
5,We really enjoyed our stay in a connected room with our two kids. They had a memorable days at playhouse. Everything went beyond in Grand Hayatt ;) There were some event there which didn't annoy your relaxation.
4,"Overall the experience was good. The big pool was extremely hot, it looked like we were in a hot tub, unbearable. The breakfast was quite poor, with no much options. I was expecting a lot more. If you choose to have access to the grand club, you will actually pay more and have breakfast in a really hot place, sweating like a cow. For the normal reservations, you actually have access to a nice room with air conditioner.  "

5,Such a lovely place. We really had a memmorable time here.We got a very warm welcome by the superb front office team. The welcome drink and cold towel they served was really refreshing.Staffs are very friendly and always ready to assist. Food and the restaurant services are excellent.
4,"Despite the hotel emailing me to check what time I will arrive & if they need to pick me up - one of my rooms wasn’t ready when I arrived at 4pm until 6pm! I was really annoyed that when I said that hotel check-in is at 3pm, the front desk said “oh, the check-in process begins at 3pm” - whatever that means. A bit flippant for a Grand Hyatt hotel to tell a hotel guest & member - my other experiences with Grand Hyatts are very different to say the least. Otherwise, all other hotel staff is fantastic.   Thankfully that was the only negative experience. The hotel grounds are beautifully landscaped & the swimming pools cleverly interconnected with slides. But the pool water is really warm, it is like swimming in a bathtub - you can’t jump into the pool to cool off but the opposite.…"
5,Paradise on Bali. This is a beautiful hotel set in many acres.   Everything runs slowly cause of the humidity except for room service who must run they come so quickly. The air conditioning was great in the rooms just when your old the heat and the walking are tough. The hotel themselves were amazing and super helpful. 
5,"Beautiful hotel in Nusa Dua. The grounds are lovely (but there are a lot of them - the property is huge) and the room we had was very large and comfortable. We tried 3 pools - all great (try the Bay Club pool a bit cooler and seemed unknown as they were only a few of us there - adults only) and the beach which was clean and clear. If you want to escape the resort the Bali Collection is next door - plenty of shopping and restaurants - a 7 minute leisurely walk (my son timed it). We hired push bikes ($6 for 4 hours) and rode along the beach front - not that long so you wouldn’t need 6 hours but there are a few little market stalls, restaurants and bars along the way as well as all the other resorts. Stop at the ‘water blow’ if it is high tide or just for a great view. Go right to…"

4,We came early and had to wait 6 hours for a room. They upgraded us to a suite which was nice. Booked an ocean view room after our first 3 nights and they gave us a room with a really loud AC plus it was either too cold or too hot. After a sleepless night they gave us another room that had a great view and silent AC. They did their best to accomodate us and we appreciate that!  The service was really good and friendly. Specially the staff in breakfast area. Great breakfast buffet! So much to choose from. Big gym with most equipment. Good pools and well maintained gardens.  This place is beautiful! We had a good week there.
5,"Rarely do I get to write a piece that commends a hotel than this one. As I am ultra critical of all hotels and restaurants that I have visited worldwide and many full short of five star expectations in my opinion.  Our holiday journey from beginning to end was seamless with a level of anticipatory service unsurpassed by your competitors.   I was pleased that the Hotel Manager, Amit Gurung and his team, Agus –Director of Rooms and Ayu –Assistant director of rooms  all on individual occasions reach out to us throughout our stay and were a delight to talk to with a genuine desire to ensure every step of our holiday journey was magic and memorable.  It is the highly trained people in this hotel that make it a really special hospitality holiday or conference venue – in my view the…"
3,"We stayed here recently in a Club Room. The room was lovely and the service was great but what let this hotel down was the food. Club food usually has delicious nibbles before dinner. The nibbles were there but inedible as was the breakfast. In the morning we only found bacon as someone else was eating it. It was hidden away in the kitchen no signs saying you could even order it, along with my daughters eggs Benedict. Again we saw another person eating this and ordered it. There was an egg station but that was not on it. Communication and the Chefs need improving.  The pools were lovely and the grounds beautiful but food really let this hotel down. Very very disappointing. "
5,"We stayed for 3nights and we are truly delighted that we chose Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. First, they upgraded us from King Bed Ocean View to King Executive room- free of charge! When we entered the room, they decorated it for the occasion- flowers, basket of fruits and the bed with pink rose petals and Happy Anniversary Greetings. We also reserve a Romantic Dinner for our family by the beach and they really prepared for it! Flowers, table setting, service, the trio who played songs for us and the food- all exceptional! I am really lost of good words to describe.. facilities- beach, pool, restaurant- my son called it paradise! We will definitely be back again!"
5,"We enjoyed being back at the Grand Hyatt Bali. We stayed in the Club Members area.

We had such an amazing time, every member of staff we interacted with were so helpful and friendly and the service was absolutely amazing. We were even treated to a surprise flower arrangement in our room on our first night as it was our honeymoon. Touches like that made the stay that much more special.  We also really enjoyed the beach front at the hotel and the river pools were gorgeous. "

5,"Our first visit to Bali and we cannot praise the Grand Hyatt Nusa Du enough after a spectacular 8 night stay to celebrate a special birthday.  With our family group of 13, ranging in ages from 7 to 72 it could have been a logistical nightmare however the staff were exemplary in their attention.  From the initial check in, to the wait staff to cleaning staff , everyone expressed a friendly welcome at all times.  Our 6 rooms were close by on the ground floor, over looking beautiful water lily ponds with wildlife in and around.  We could sit on our balcony and relax in its tranquility.  Rooms were large with an extra day bed.  The bathrooms were spacious and good pressure.  Learnt the hard way that the hot water needs the main power switched on.  The AC could be adjusted to…"
5,"It was such a great place, to stay. Great room, great facilities, best sea view and fun activities around it. Very kind, friendly n helpful employee. Very close with Bali collection. All is perfectly for me.  Very recommend hotel to stay.  "
1,"We had many issues with our stay this time at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa dua. Firstly, upon checking in we were told to ask for late checkout the day before leaving. We did this, with reception stating that it was not possible as the hotel was fully booked. I checked online...it wasn’t. Rang again to complain twice..finally speaking to someone in management and them providing a late checkout for us.  Upon checking out I was charged $160 aud for a 10min phone call to a toll free number! I had to leave the situation, and let my husband deal with the horrible woman at reception, who just so happened to be the same woman I asked about late checkout the day before. We have stayed at this resort 5 times now, I am even a Hyatt member, but because of this treatment we will never stay…"

Rooms were large with an extra day bed.  The bathrooms were spacious and good pressure.  Learnt the hard way that the hot water needs the main power switched on.  The AC could be adjusted to…"
5,"It was such a great place, to stay. Great room, great facilities, best sea view and fun activities around it. Very kind, friendly n helpful employee. Very close with Bali collection. All is perfectly for me.  Very recommend hotel to stay.  "
1,"We had many issues with our stay this time at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa dua. Firstly, upon checking in we were told to ask for late checkout the day before leaving. We did this, with reception stating that it was not possible as the hotel was fully booked. I checked online...it wasn’t. Rang again to complain twice..finally speaking to someone in management and them providing a late checkout for us.  Upon checking out I was charged $160 aud for a 10min phone call to a toll free number! I had to leave the situation, and let my husband deal with the horrible woman at reception, who just so happened to be the same woman I asked about late checkout the day before. We have stayed at this resort 5 times now, I am even a Hyatt member, but because of this treatment we will never stay…"
1,"I stayed 3 years ago in Grand Hyatt Bali, everything was good and i like the hotel and brought my family with me on 17 January 2020, however, unfortunately the room was in a really bad condition, the safe box wasn’t working, the bathroom door was broken and it was tough to close the door, the furnitures were too old and dusty. This is not a 5 star hotel anymore!!! They need to renew their interior design, furnitures. The room smells musty and dusty!  I called the reception, asked them to fix the safe box, so that I could leave the room to go to the beach, I waited in overall one hour for them to fix the safety box, the bathroom door. Finally they changed the room, however, it was already sunset and I couldn’t have time to go to the beach. They wasted one day from my vacation and…"
3,Pros: 1.the landscape is magical. You can spend a whole day just taking amazing photos inside the hotel 2.clean and neat 3.breakfast was good in one restaurant. Not very rich in varieties but it was delicious  Cons: 1.Ocean was barely visible for an ocean view room 2.Breakfast was served in 3 restaurants. Not all with the same quality as they tell you. 3.They didn't accept my late checkout request although I mentioned that I need it months before when I booked because my flight was like 8pm and I had no where to go for like 5 hours 4.The beach is full with seaweed its nearly impossible to enjoy a swim 5.the beach isn't well prepared. Sunbeds are scattered. No waiters to take orders. And its a long walk till you get to the water or to get to the pool where you can order anything…
4,We travelled to the Grand Hyatt in January and on arrival we were pleased to be greeted with a cold drink and a cold hand towel as it was very humid. Unfortunately we were then required to wait until the check in time (we were two hours early) but the Hyatt did provide us with a drink voucher each (the mocktails were delicious). When we did get into the room I thought it had a very strong cleaning products odour and I was horrified to find splashed blood on the inside of the toilet door. In all fairness it would have been difficult for the housekeeping staff to see with the pattern used on the glass. Unfortunately we also found brown stains (eek!!) on our fresh towels. On a positive note the grounds and pools are incredibly beautiful and our kids loved the waterslide. Food…
5,"We loved staying at the Hyatt, there was plenty to do and keep the kids entertained and we loved that the Bali Connection shopping centre was walking distance and gave additioal options for food. This is a large property with lots of things happening in differrent corners which is great when you have to push the pram around for a couple of hours a day. Our 6 yr old boy loved the waterslide. We thought the pool was a bit too warm but it was certainly well layed out and maintained. We restaurants were good and all staff attentive. I can see there is a lot of mixed reviews here, i assume it has to do with expecations. This is Asia. The Pizza in the Italian restaurant will not taste like the one you had in Amalfi. Maintenance standards may be different to those in the US. You will…"
1,Its amazing that a Hyatt hotel can’t seem to fix an ant problem.  The first night we noticed a trail of around a hundred plus ants in the bathroom sink.  We notified the front desk and they said they would handle it.  2nd night we had ants in the daybed.  Our kids could not sleep in their bed because of all the ants in the bed.  3rd and 4th night ants came back to the bathroom sink area.  We were given a can of ant spray but could not use it due to our little kids.  We were later told they called to relocate us into another room but never left a message.

5,"Great luxury Location at Nusa Dua. The staff are happy to help with anything that you need. Great Buffet Breakfast Excellent Pool, slide and entertainment for kids. For the Adults, I highly recommend The Kriya Spa - an absolute must to visit."
1,"I stayed here with my family (my sister and parents) from 20th december to 21st december. I'm so glad it was only one night!   The hotel lobby is nice but the rest of the hotel is very dated and needs a refurb. From when we arrived the service was lacking.. we had to wait hours just to receive one room key and didn't receive the key for our second room till much later that day. I'm sure that the hotel wasn't full. When we did receive both keys our rooms were no where near each other.   But the worst part about our stay is that in both rooms we found 2 cockroaches ( so 4 cockroaches in total in this hotel!) 2 in the bathroom in one room. One on the pillow in the cupboard in the other room and one on the bed. This is absolutely disgraceful for a hyatt hotel, especially the grand…"
3,"Had a great 5 night stay in beautiful Nusa Dua but the Grand Hyatt is tired and the rooms certainly do not live up to its 5 star category. The room we were given upon check-in was only made up for two people when we are a family of 4. They kindly found us another room however the amenities such as fridge and kettle were run down/not working. Overall a great stay with beautiful pool areas and lounge chairs but the resort could do with a shuttle service given the size of grounds and distance from rooms to lobby, main entrance, pools and restaurants and The Bali Collection.  If you are travelling with young children or the elderly, request a room within close proximity to pool areas/restaurants."
4,"A giant hotel and one of the early ones into Nusa Dua, so well positioned and on a good expanse of beach. Rooms need an update and I am not sure I have ever seen a smaller television in a room!! Filter coffee at breakfast should have gone a long time ago...a proper machine with beans is pretty much a standard these days. Nusa Dua has had a lot of newer hotels added since the Grand Hyatt was built and it needs to lift it's game. The grounds are very nice, but then most hotels in Nusa Dua are very nice. Facilities are good, fitness centre and spa are particularly good."
5,"Grand Hyatt Bali: Time to say good bye to this gorgeous hotel. We stayed here 3.5 years ago for the first time and fell in love with it then, so when Luxury Escapes had the deal again last year we knew we had to book again.   Grand Hyatt is located in a beautiful part of Bali called Nusa Dua. It is in a section of 5 star resorts on the beach front.  We were treated to 3 dinners, 1 lunch, 8 x cocktails each adult and 2 x 30 minute massages in the beautiful Kriya Spa.   On check in the staff were so lovely and very accomodating. We gave our bags over, checked in and went to have lunch at Bali Collections as we arrived early and the room was not ready.  We came back about 2pm and we were given vouchers to a bar at the lobby to have a drink as the room still was not ready. We did…"

5,We had a lovely 8 day stay. Room was overlooking Bali pool and was perfect size for the 4 of us. Every restaurant had delicious food and great service. We didn’t need to leave the resort which is what we wanted. Close to airport. Kids loved the 50m water slide. It didn’t seem very busy because of the size of the resort. 
5,"In January 2020 was our third stay in Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. As before we find the hotel pools, garden, rooms and food are excellent and we have had wonderful stay. The beach side of Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua has been kept clean and safe to swim."
5,"An absolutely beautiful resort with an amazing open air lobby as you enter the hotel. The resort is sprawling with multiple restaurants and pools. The location is not centrally located in Bali, but I would definitely highly recommend it. It had a great gym with free weights, machines and cardio equipment. The Regency Club was beautiful and had great breakfast food and snacks throughout the day. They give you a wonderfully refreshing drink when you check in. The service and knowledge base of the staff was noticeably better at the Regency Club than in other parts of the resort. That is not to say the other staff wasn't helpful, but I found that they would give different and incorrect answers about the resort for example when does the onsite currency exchange open. The Hyatt has…"
5,Grand Hyatt Bali is a sprawling property with activities for all age groups. We were here to spend the family vacation and celebrate 5th Birthday of my grand daughter. The rooms are well maintained and clean. As a Globalist member I was upgraded to Suite which had excellent facilities. Overall the stay was very comfortable and enjoyable.
5,"This trip to Nusa Dua was fantastic at the Grand Hyatt. the hotel, built in 1991 is old but quality built. The grounds are amazing and really contribute to your overall experience. The gardens and trees make you feel so relaxed as you stroll along the beachside walk. Service is great and a highlight for us was a night and the balinese markets having dinner and show.  thanks to the team for a great experience."

Had a bit trouble with sleep due to trouble with air con and finding the right temperature in the room, also a bit too firm beds. Otherwise super please with the stay! Could have had a bit more celebration for New Year at the Resort. "
4,"Our daughter and her family stayed here and we stayed at the Inaya so we spent some time with them at this lovely hotel. The rooms are nice with a nice size balcony. The window seat conversion to a bed for their daughter was so well done and our 2 yr old granddaughter loved her special bed. They liked the breakfast selection and the food at the other restaurants. The kids chicken sandwich at the restaurant by the pool was AMAZING... The coconut ice cream you can get by the pool area is SOOO DELICIOUS. The grounds are huge but very pretty. The pool is a great size with 2 water slides which are great for the big (adult) and small kids 😀😀, it’s also nice to sit around because of all the frangipani trees - sooooo nice (typical Bali). The ledge around the side in the pool are great…"
5,We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali to  end the last two days of our honeymoon. The resort is beautiful for the honeymoon couple or the entire family! The rooms are spacious. The food is excellent and the service is outstanding. 
1,"This was our first and last stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali.  Check in process was ok, there was no information given, just a map of a large premises that was pretty vague.  Rooms were clean, although dated and beds were very uncomfortable, we both woke with sore backs each morning. We had 2 rooms (ocean view) and 1 fridge didn't work and 1 was just cool, we brought it up but no one ever fixed. Staff were pretty heads down and only a few would say hello.  Breakfast at the main location (Salsa Verde)was nothing awesome, but we found on day 3 the Garden Cafe and the service here was fantastic. I had booked back in April to have dinner at one of the restaurants and on the afternoon of found i had to pay $130/head (incl. children) or wait til 9:30pm for their a la carte menu to be…"
4,"First, this resort is very nice and I recommend staying here.  But first I do want get a couple of negatives out of the way.  These aren’t deal breakers, but stuff you and hotel need to know.  1. This resort is old, but it is well maintained. But our room (executive king) we consistently had poor water pressure and noisy A/c issues in our room. They did come by and fix one ac issue (rather quickly service too), but with our noisy heavy foot neighbors above us, we found the ac was good white noise. 2. Our room hallway (just hallway) had weird Odor when walk in, almost mildew like? 3. Master toilet had a slight sewer smell. 4. Not hotel fault, but there is a beach club nearby who’s thumping base music was felt at 1am most nights.  Now to the good stuff. First, I can not recommend…"

1,There was no baby changing unit all over the hotel. Pool was very old and dirty. There was one toddler pool which is like a decoration not a pool. One kids club but just accept above 3 years. We couldn’t go in with our daughter. There is only one restaurant with A/C. I don’t recommend to families with kids under the age of 3.
4,"Beautiful hotel with lovely grounds.  The pool is an oasis with little nooks and caves...fabulous for kids and a great escape out of the burning sun.  The Salsa Verde is a superb Italian restaurant with wood fired oven pizzas and fabulous Italian food.  Customer service was very friendly and accommodating. Small complaint on the cleanliness of the room each day, but was addressed very quickly when brought to the guest services attention"
3,"Pros:  Nice resorts and within walking distance to Bali Collection.  Gated community so you will always be feeling safe. Nice open outdoor Club Lounge with plenty of seatings.  Cons: The room is quite dated with a tiny TV. AC is very weak; especially when it is so hot there. Club Lounge doesn't stock up on drinks, so if you want drinks, you have to ask attendants. Plus, the spread weren't interesting at all. Steam room looks old and run down; definitely need renovation. The worst of all: this resorts is full of family with kids. It felt like as if we were at a daycare center. It was so busy and full of kids running around that it didn't feel like we were on vacation.

4,"Grounds and facilities were great for a young family.  The rooms were a bit dated, however, and the the service could be quite slow given the size/occupancy of the resort.  I would come back as you do not need to leave the resort and the beach to enjoy your vacation.  "
1,"1. Terrible hygiene standards   - We discovered a dead frog with its insides and larva being slashed by the current in the bottom of the main pool while babies & children were enjoying their time in the pool right next to it without knowledge. After requesting that the frog be fished out for the safety of children swimming & digesting the pool's water,not 1 but 2 times, a senior looking staff came along looking annoyed as ever, and said 'frog NOT DANGEROUS' and that they would try to find the frog remains TOMORROW  morning(it was barely 2pm in a sunny afternoon) To me, it felt like they didn't want any other guests to find out because then they would have to deal with a couple of dozen complaints, and not just the one they were dealing with right now. We were really digusted by…"

5,"We tried to escape the cold winter in Sydney and what a great decision  to come to Bali in July and to pick Grand Hyatt as our home for a couple of days. This resort is huge with several pools to choose from, a wide and clean beach, well-maintained gardens and ponds, great restaurants and a bar, a shopping arcade - basically anything you need really. It's a family-friendly resort so perfect choice as we were coming with a 7-year-old. My son enjoyed the slides at the pools and for someone who's a picky eater, also enjoyed the food at the Italian restaurant. The staff were polite and friendly, we felt welcomed all the time. We loved hanging out at the lobby in the afternoon when the Rindik performers are present. The music was very relaxing and calming. Love to go back to this…"
1,"Was really disappointed with their service level and doesn’t feel like Grand Hyatt it’s known for. Had pretty bad experience during check in, we had two rooms booked. While one room they gave the key around 2 pm, they kept us waiting for the key for additional 2 ½ hours. "
5,"At arrival from a long flight through Doha, was disappointed when asked to  deposit $500 as a security at the reception for a trip that was already fully paid for in advance,this can be unsettling for any traveler if not briefed  early.Despite this was ushered in well and got allocated good rooms with the family.the hotel is family friendly and  with all the options for the family members irrespective of age. The staff were very friendly and  breakfast was an array of foods that catered for any international visitor.Clean beach and the shopping area (Bali collection just next to the hotel.Our overall experience was good ."
5,"A must stay destination if you are going with your family and kids. There is so much to do. Grand Hyatt is on the beach and with a fantastic pool, restaurants with finger licking food and an amazing Salsa Bar overlooking the beach its fun for everyone."
5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali was a great place for everything you can possibly wish for in Bali.  Great Hotel, beautiful rooms, the beach is right there, multiple pools, fabulous restaurants and the best staff.  I highly recommend the Grand Club.

5,"At arrival from a long flight through Doha, was disappointed when asked to  deposit $500 as a security at the reception for a trip that was already fully paid for in advance,this can be unsettling for any traveler if not briefed  early.Despite this was ushered in well and got allocated good rooms with the family.the hotel is family friendly and  with all the options for the family members irrespective of age. The staff were very friendly and  breakfast was an array of foods that catered for any international visitor.Clean beach and the shopping area (Bali collection just next to the hotel.Our overall experience was good ."
5,"A must stay destination if you are going with your family and kids. There is so much to do. Grand Hyatt is on the beach and with a fantastic pool, restaurants with finger licking food and an amazing Salsa Bar overlooking the beach its fun for everyone."
5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali was a great place for everything you can possibly wish for in Bali.  Great Hotel, beautiful rooms, the beach is right there, multiple pools, fabulous restaurants and the best staff.  I highly recommend the Grand Club.  Grand Hyatt Bali is private, good for children and in a great location.  I loved it."
5,Excellent location with wide white beach. Excellent customer service. Great Christmas Eve and Christmas dinner . One of the best spa experience. Thank you Agus Heru- Welcoming staff who was very gracious and informative making our stay memorable.
4,"Everyone especially our kids love the swimming pool. It’s beautiful! Can’t fault anything. The hotel ground is pretty, we stayed here for nine days and don’t want to leave.  Hotel room is clean but needs to be renovated, especially the bathroom. That makes you feel that you are not paying for a 5 star hotel.   Overall We love this hotel! Will come back. Thanks to Tuty to make our room spotless. Teguh for his welcome at the reception. "
5,WE stayed there for five days to celebrate Xmas. It was very clean and staff members were very friendly. The food were great and there was a couple of restaurants to choose for breakfast. The swimming pool was large enough for kids and families to enjoy.
4,"With 8 nights booked at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua over the Christmas period our intention was to relax and unwind. If you are looking for a relaxing holiday, swimming eating and wandering around a beautiful garden resort then look no further.   With over 600 rooms spread across the resort it is a big facility. Breakfast was included plus a luxury escapes bonus package. This included a number of meals across the resort, cocktails for dinner, plus a 1 hour massage and 30 minute reflexology deal. A large number of the restaurants were not air-conditioned making dining a hot and sticky event.    What I did find annoying was that when you presented your vouchers you were given a different menu for food and drinks. Regardless of this, the vouchers were a nice way to enjoy a cocktail…"
5,Beautiful hotel with amazing gardens. Very comfortable spacious rooms and excellent facilities.  Easy access to the beach and short walk to the Bali collection shopping centre  Would definitely come back.

4,"Pluses: 1. Spacious rooms with a balcony overlooking ponds with lotus plants and ducks.  2. Wide property, low rise buildings, enough room to go jogging. 3. Big pool for soaking but not for doing swim laps. Fun and nicely designed though. 4. Wide white sand beach. 5. Good Japanese and Italian restaurants and an eclectic cafe. 6. Friendly and helpful and unobstrusive staff.  Minuses: (mostly about the food) 1. Breakfast buffet at the Cafe has limited items (as compared to other Grand Hyatt  Hotels).  2. The Bali food dinner buffet with Bali dancers performing? Boring. First, there is really nothing special about Balinese cuisine (As compared to Thai or Vietnamese). The Local salad called gado gado - it was warm(should be chilled) and used wilted veggies. 3. The Bali dances would…"
5,"Stayed for 5 nights here with my wife and 2 kids, just after our stay at Kuta. This resort is very large with several pools and restaurants. Gardens are very pretty and well manicured. My kids loved the various koi ponds with many fish situated around the resort. Breakfast was good too. The beach is very clean and pristine, loungers and shade are available as well, look out for friendly squirrels that will visit you while on beach. At the main pool there is good service for food and drinks, Dewi was our waiter and was very friendly. All staff were very helpful and courteous. Best part of the is resort is the location, as it is right next to Bali Collection shopping centre which has many shops and restaurants. Also we used GRAB delivery app when we got tired of restaurant food…"
5,"Loved all the amenities of staying at  Hyatt property, while still getting the Bali experience. Very nice mix of traditional and modern. Staff was very friendly, housekeeping was attentive, and our stay was amazing during the Xmas holiday."
1,"We paid quite a bit since it was Hyatt Bali for 4 nights ( husband , myself and kids aged 4 and 5). It is an almost gated community area minus the hustle bustle of  other areas in Bali.  Check in took ages- lots of guests - and we were escorted to our room in the West Wing - so so far away from lobby/ pool and the rest of the world. They did give us a complimentary massage voucher and dinner voucher but we were unable to use it because of the terrible events that unfolded. Please note I did go to the reception and ask them for a closer room since kids were making a fuss too. They told me to pack my bags before going out the next day and they will do it.  After a full day out exploring Bali we went back to our room only to find the key cards didn’t work. No phone outside to call…"
5,"We just got back from Bali for a few days of vacation, and this was our first time to ever stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali. Firstly, the hotel itself was amazing. One thing you must know is that the compound is massive. There are 4 different hotel buildings, with tennis courts, a big swimming pool, a Spa, gym and everything else you may need. The hotel compound has a lot to do with fantastic restaurants and amenities for guests. There is also great WiFi which connects everyone from the beach to the rooms.   One of the best parts was the restaurants and especially the buffet. There are 2 main restaurants for the buffet - one by the main lobby and another restaurant called WaterCourt which is just a walk away. No matter which one you choose, they have the same breakfast options. The…"

5,"Beautiful resort!  Highly recommend, from the beautiful people who work here, to the amenities and the amazingly stunning grounds. The waterslide and the private beach was a highlight for our family! Buffet breakfast was plentiful. The only downfall we could find here was the prices after your accomodation. A glass of wine at the pool or a soft drink was very over priced! $19 for a glass of Indonesian white and a can of Fanta. Meals at the restaurants were also pricey. But the atmosphere was amazing. Thank you for a wonderful stay and we will definitely return to the Grand Hyatt Bali ☺️"
3,"We chose this resort for the cheapness of the rooms and (as others have commentated) yes, they are tired and dated but seemed clean and smell-less to us. The breakfast buffet is super expensive for what it is and after three mornings we removed this from our stay and took pot luck in the resort. After a dreadful experience at ""The Verandah"" we realised that in order to charge US 24++ dollars per head for the average breakfast buffet, they've made it impossible to get anything else decent at the resort until at least 12ish. Best bet is to take the path south and there's some opportunity for a pastry and coffee further along the beach.  In fact the evening dining is also pretty crummy. Super expensive Japanese restaurant with average food (the absence of diners being a bit of a…"
3,"Am here right now and am disappointed in certain ways with Grand Hyatt. We are 3 families with kids and staying here for 10nights. Given the heat, it’s pretty inconsistent a policy around water in the rooms. Last 3 days we’ve had water bottles in abundant supply but suddenly the hotel decides 1 bottle policy per day. With 2kids and the heat it’s pretty disappointing that this is probably the only hotel in Asia which has such rules. Happy to speak to the manager on the feedback as I am staying here until 1st Jan. "
5,"We have stayed in Grand Hyatt Bali for 7days.The staff and service stand out In particular.I would like to thank all staff for the amazing service and wonderful company. The hotel is nice near to Bali Collection for some shoping,front beach.best place"
5,"We have just started our Bali trip but can't resist  to give a 5 star review for this hotel. This is our first trip with our one year old and we are gald we choose thos hotel.   We arrived early to the hotel after our long flight. We all were tired and hence the hotel kindly offered us complementery drinks at one of the restaurants and an early check in even at a time when the hotel is full.  The room was good, comfortable  and clean as you can expect from any Hyatt's hotel. The hotel has multiple zones with different views and multiple activities for every age. We have a garden view room which has a rustic feeling which adds to the theme of Bali. The Grand Club rooms were not available  so may be we will try next time.   The location of the hotel is great with 5 mins walk to a…"

3,"While as a family this is good value and a great location, it comes with some set backs.  I have stayed at this hotel a couple of seperate times now and both times my family have suffered sore ears and ear infections from the water quality in the pools ( which we haven't at other locations )"
5,"I found this resort excellent. Room was very clean, big resort. I found the service very good. Reception and room service were very good. Breakfast could have been better, its more of a English breakfast. "
3,"We checked in evening of 27th, for 6 nights and room was much smaller than we expected this was a double room deluxe. Outside we could smell seaweeds which was quite strong and sickening. Wasn't impressed as our initial thought of room was a 3*. Next morning as was showering, the shower pipe was shaking as we tried to turn on the hot water, I was actually scared it might fall off on my head, moreover our bathroom room was flooded as the drain was blocked!! We complained and had to wait 2 hour to get another room sorted. After we changed to new room was more spacious but at least the shower was working!  I would say on the beach they had regular local coming to sell things, they should really have staff on beach to monitor them. Other than this it was a average stay! The resort…"
5,"I was accompanied by Bella and Adelina from marketing and social media throughout the trip. They were wonderful in playing host and taking me around the compounds, giving me recommendations on places to explore in Bali. I can’t stress how kind and accommodating they were. Everywhere we went we really felt the staff’s sincerity towards guests and I felt very welcomed, so thank you :) "
1,"We checked into Grand Hyatt Bali on 20 Dec 2019.  My wife and I were assigned to a room with twin-bed. This was not highlighted to us by the front desk when we checked in.   We only found out about it when the staff guided us to our room. The staff assured that they will inform Housekeeping to change to a queen/king-size bed. We then decided to call the operator to inquire about it after not hearing from them after more than 30 mins.  After several follow-ups with the operator & front desk, they were not able to give a satisfactory explanation to why we were assigned to a twin-bed room in the first place instead of a queen/king-size room. As it was getting late, we did not want to pursue further hence, requested the Housekeeping to merge the twin-bed into one.  We are very…"

1,"The check-in process was very bad by the standards of what we’d expect of this kind of hotel. Check-in time was 3pm, we arrived early, before 2pm. The attending staff told us he’d try to check us in before 3pm. It is now 3:40pm, and the staff are ignoring us. I caught their eye, and they just turned away. In embarrassment or disdain, I’m not sure. No explanation, no apology, no compensating offer.   Twice in the entire process, I was asked to “wait a moment”, and the staff didn’t say whether to stand and wait or take a seat nearby. Until I asked, then I was told to take a seat. All this, even though I used a crutch and had already told them that I had a leg injury.   Our assigned rooms were on the second floor. When I asked whether I could get alternate rooms, possibly on the…"
1,"We stayed three nights at the Hyatt. Positives: 1. Sauna area is really nice especially the cold plunge pool.   Negatives: 1. Staff are obnoxious and condescending. The number of times I heard “this is standard in the way we do it here / we don’t do that here” might haunt me. Particular example is where we pointed out that if you sell somebody a king size bed, it’s probably a bit annoying for it actually to be 2 separate beds squashed together with a gaping hole in the middle - in this example we were told via a printed letter that the beds are arranged that way for convenience for other guests, I.e. deal with it.  2. We paid for laundry and they broke our clothes. We didn’t get a refund.  3. Breakfast buffet food is really bad. Probably the worst I’ve had in the past 5 years.…"

While some the public spaces, gardens and beach areas are beautiful, the rooms were extremely disappointing and some areas of this resort are well past their use by date.  We had to change rooms three times due to their poor condition and mold, they are definitely not of a 5 star standard.

5,As a couple this is probably the fifth or sixth visit since the very first time back in 1993. It was this that most likely triggered an upgraded room on arrival.  Book into the Grand Club to take advantage of both Breakfast & Evening (1700-1900) Drinks & Canapes. The service levels are faultless.  The only (internal) observation I would make is that I think the Hotel has cut back marginally on the breadth of the Food offering relevant to the past. This does not take away from the people & the geography.  We knew of & used again an excellent external tour guide - Jalandesa Bali Tours
5,"In my recent trip to Bali, I chose Grand Hyatt as my first destination. This property is right on the beach and it has private beach.. Beautiful resort with huge swimming pool.. the resort is designed in such a way that each and every room is facing a lake or any Aqua body.  It has 3-4 great restaurants.. it has a little market inside the resort itself.. the cultural activities in the Balinese temple inside the resort is exceptional.. i had a tasty veg pizza and pasta in the salsa verde restaurant which was really good.. big buffet spread, but less indian delicacies in there.. the rooms are simply huge and amazing.. all the amenities in place for w five star resort.  Great place great food, but less indian and vegetarian options.. "
1,"For the moment spent on this hotel, don’t expect you will receive exceptional professional services. I’m Indonesian and I’ve stayed in many 5 stars hotels& resorts in Bali and most of the stay the staff treated me friendly and equally just like other guests ( foreign).  But Here, I would say the staff are discriminated towards local guests. I have noticed in every single days during our stay, they would great the foreign guests but not me ( the Indonesian).   So rude and not polite people consider you think that you would be nice to your own kind of people. I have to break down the discrimination events I have encountered in this place as below:   1. I was at the Gym, the staff ( Named Dani) greeted all the foreign guests “good morning how are u” but when she passed me didn’t…"
5,"Absolutely fantastic experience. Probably the best hotel experience we have had in 30 years. We paid for the club experience and this was well worth it with an allocated open air, exclusive club where free breakfast and refreshments were served up. "
5,"I took my daughter and granddaughter here for a 5 day stay.   The setting is absolutely beautiful.  The accommodation is set out in 4 villages and villas, set well a part.  You will need to do a lot of walking in the resort if you want to enjoy the various restaurants and facilities. I saw a couple of wheelchair guests managing well. We stayed in an Ambassador suite (2324) on the 3rd floor of East Village which had lovely pool and sea views.  It was well suited for two adults and a child with traditional Indonesian inspired interiors and a very big balcony. There was a smallish kitchenette with a microwave and an additional powder room as well as a huge main bathroom and a separate dressing area and study.   The whole suite was immaculately clean. Wifi was good and…"

5,"I took my daughter and granddaughter here for a 5 day stay.   The setting is absolutely beautiful.  The accommodation is set out in 4 villages and villas, set well a part.  You will need to do a lot of walking in the resort if you want to enjoy the various restaurants and facilities. I saw a couple of wheelchair guests managing well. We stayed in an Ambassador suite (2324) on the 3rd floor of East Village which had lovely pool and sea views.  It was well suited for two adults and a child with traditional Indonesian inspired interiors and a very big balcony. There was a smallish kitchenette with a microwave and an additional powder room as well as a huge main bathroom and a separate dressing area and study.   The whole suite was immaculately clean. Wifi was good and…"
5,"Excellent resort, very clean with great food. The location is exceptional with great shopping. The grounds are better that all other resorts with many beautiful pools and pathways and bridges ponds and waterfalls."
5,"We had a very pleasant time at this wonderful resort. Beautiful beach, luxury grounds, comfortable room, perfect breakfast. Staff very professional and courteous. Some very cool restaurants here. Also, the nearby Mall Bali Collection has many shops to conveniently shop around."
5,We enjoyed our stay here. Pool was fantastic hotel was lovely and all staff were helpful. Highly recommended. We would definitely come back. Even though was hot weather we were able to crank the aircon in hotel and relax. Exactly what we needed. Grand Hyatt bali thank you for having us. 
3,"The engineering department apparently identified that a replacement part was needed to resolve the problem in one room so we moved to another with, you guessed it, more problems with that rooms aircon.  The engineer promised a team would attend the next day to rectify the problem but this didn't happen.  Disappointing!"
4,"Great location in Nsa Dua, especially if you would like a game of golf. Nusa Dua National only 5 minutes from hotel...great course but not cheap if you have to rent clubs, shoes etc. Hotel is big, but never seems to be a crowd in any one place, except breakfast, where sometimes you have to wait (Garden Cafe) for a few minutes. Breakfast food good and varied. A variety of swimming pools...although they can get quite warm... Food at the restaurants is good, although this varies from time to time. Only real complaint was that the room temperature would not go below 25 degrees. Staff were super warm, friendly and always a smile. Late check out until 6.00pm was good as many of the flights are from 7.00pm onwards. The US$90 + taxesfor the privilege of the late checkout was a…"

5,"We spent two nights at the Grand Hyatt Bali in Nusa Dua on the beach after a few days in the jungle in Ubud, Bali.  This property and location is quite different from Ubud, and is so large that we got lost a couple of times.  Still it seemed very quiet and peaceful at the pool and on the beach.  I agree with other commenters that the club room is the way to go as it includes an expansive breakfast in the morning and unlimited cocktails as appetizers in the evening, all for a very reasonable price.  We did take advantage of the beautiful spa, which was well worth the money even though you could walk across the street to the mall and get a treatment for about US $20. "
5,"Huge Hotel, but so quite and private. Lots of restaurants and bars to choose from. Staff always helpful and friendly. Great kids pool. Spa close by with fantastic treatments. Beautiful beach in front of hotel, so if the many pools dont appeal to you, just walk to the beach."
4,Staying here for 2 nights. The room was old but everything works just fine.... The facilities and staffs was AWESOME.... Friendly and helpful... Especially NINIK The breakfast was OK with limited variety. It's not really I would expect from a Grand Hyatt... Hotel amenities are not as complete as the other hotel might provide...  I would definitely return with my kids next time..
5,"We have recently returned from our fourth trip to Bali and the Grand Hyatt Hotel. What a place! Fabulous hotel, beach, exquisite garden surroundings and the most wonderful staff - this place never disappoints! On our arrival, we were greeted so genuinely with beautiful smiles and a welcome home. As members of the Grand Club within the hotel, in Addi we found a manager whom was determined to please, no request too much and after our many chats, now consider a friend. The reception staff were all very efficient and helpful, in particular ‘Wiji’ whom introduced us to Bali mango - wow! Thank you Addi for your care and attention during our stay. A BIG thank you to Uri and his wonderful and attentive team of staff, there are too many to mention all, but a very ‘special’ thank you to…"
4,"Stayed three nights in Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua. Its a beautiful property right on the beach. Our ocean view room was fantastic. Per night rate is little high. All together it was a nice family vacation."

2,Rooms are very old and dated and we were told our Room was one of the renovated ones.The elevators at this property had no AC so that made them very very hot! Some of the common areas look nice and some very old. We stayed at both Grand Hyatt Bali and Hyatt Bail. I would 100% recommend Hyatt Bali. On a positive note the staff at the at Grand Hyatt is amazing as it is at the Hyatt Bali also.
5,"A fantastic place to chill out in.Very relaxed. Some conferences,but they are fairly discreet.someone mentioned loud music,though I have not heard any. Food and service is lovely.staff pleasant. Restaurants close by if you want a change. "
3,"This estate is vegetated with beautiful gardens and extensive, incredible  fishponds.  Wildlife galore. Water Monitor Lizards, microbats, Squirrels, herons, green pigeons, nightjars and many birds. Flocks of Domestic Ducks getting around.  Swimming pools are OK but not properly managed, the chlorine levels seem inadequate, especially in the popular childrens pool. Felt unclean. Waterslides were old and dated and often did not work properly.   Too many people, busloads of noisy, rude tourists. People shouting constantly from their balconies. Wierd fancy shops including a Polo Ralph Lauren shop that appeared to sell fakes. Costs of everything were more expensive than Australia and UK.   Grand Hyatt was very stingy with the water, only provided one 1.5litre bottle per family per…"
4,"A good clean resort, very friendly staff . The food and alcohol is very expensive . The resort is quite far away from everything , so costs alot for transfers , best to get your own driver for full days tripping about . Great pools . Wouldn't recommend getting vouchers for meals as not much variety . "
5,I got free upgrade to Grand executive suite because I'm a member of World of Hyatt. Room was very BIG and spacious. It looks very classy and traditional balinese vibe.  Overall we really enjoyed our stay at Grand Hyatt Bali! '

5,A classic hotel. Delightful staff. Large comfortable rooms .Beautiful landscaped gardens with exquisite planting.  Choice of restaurants.  The one near the  main pool was especially nice because of the views. Sun loungers under the trees on a beautiful clean almost empty beach. Faultless service.
5,Treat this place like a must see tourist attraction and stay here for a couple of days to experience true Balinese hospitality. Best tip is to spend at least two nights here during your Bali vaca and enjoy the resort amenities. It's called the jewel in Bali for a reason. 
5,Truly great hotel with beautiful gardens and setting. Staff are universally wonderful. Having Bali Collection next door is so convenient and provides multiple dining options without the need for a taxi. Strongly recommended. 
5,"Great location, beautiful grounds, water slide terrific for the kids, food and service excellent, and a short stroll to the Bali collection cafes and shops. Third year we have stayed here and will return again next year."
2,"I was here in April, and you can find my review, it was great!  So good, we came back and booked through luxury escapes.   The hotel still great, the service staff great and the deal itself also great.  Here’s the thing.....there have been so many conferences this time and two nights the music has been so loud that our room vibrates and the windows shook.   You could feel the bass vibrate through your body.....when we called no one seemed very concerned and simply offered that we could sleep in another room (too late I’m not moving a child already trying to sleep).  Why not prepare better and not put people in the rooms so close to the the noise.  Quite simply this hotel values the thousands of paying corporates that pay top dollar for conferences and not your average holiday…"

5,"We stayed in this hotel for a week and really enjoyed ourselves. Beautiful location, well planned rooms in 'villages' around ponds with flowering lilies and wildlife. Nusa Dua is the best area in the island to stay. The hotel was so relaxing. Made more so by the wonderful attentive staff who could not do enough for you. If you want to relax and be pampered with nice food and surroundings beside the beach, but with several swimming pools in Bali, this is the place to stay."
5,Beautiful relaxed hotel.  Great staff. Lovely room with ocean view. Pool a bit warm but no problem. Food is excellent.  Many restaurants to choose from. Good bar and staff really look after you.  Would recommend this hotel 
5,"It is a beautiful resort situated at Nusa Dua. It is a well maintained hotel with nice room, big pool including a slide for the children and well pedicured garden.   Service wise, we were well taken care by the staff at the club lounge led by Mr. Urip, the manager there. He is friendly and will make sure that you are having a great time while staying in the hotel.   The breakfast and happy hours offered at the club lounge was good. "
1,"The room condition was very bad as saw the died bugs under the bed sofa, and table. And the bathroom had a disgusting smell is coming from the sewer. The bedding is damp. The breakfast buffet didn’t have many kinds of food so not value to pay for 24++. USD. "
3,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua with my wife and 2 kids (7&9yrs) and were amazed on the sheer size of the hotel. Being relatively use of travelling to Bali several times already the kids already made their way to the pool area. The main slide was fun for the kids and gave them some fun. The ended up using their blow up beds to go down faster. Overall the pool area was great- the kids loved swimming around the rock faces. For adults, the pool area was adequate. My wife and I enjoyed sitting around by the pool but lacked the swim up pool bar we so missed in other hotels. The most obvious thing we noticed was the lack of vibe or atmosphere in the area (I know, first world problems). Other hotels had smooth background music by the bar, there was no “happy hour” for drinks…"

The hotel is very well maintained even though the rooms are not very new. We had problem with aircon on the first day, but it was fixed right away after informing and the management also left a apology note with 2 complementary sarong. Appreciate the prompt service and also the thought. Every staff in the resort were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. We tried the Salsa Verde and Pool Bar restaurants during the stay, along with breakfast at Garden Cafe and we enjoyed the spread. Only area of improvement could be on the taste of local cuisine items in the room dining. My special request for flowers and cake were taken…"
4,Fantastic resort with beautifully maintained gardens. Staff were warm and friendly and very service oriented.  We tried most of the restaurant and all of them were good.  The beach is clean and big.  For me the only downside is that my kid was not allowed to the play house because he is just below three even with a parent accompanied. The play house takes only kids above three and the parents can't hang around. I found this a bit odd considering kids clubs in other hotels.
5,"We had a great stay , the room we got was excellent and the weather for the week was very good. Spent slot of time in the Grand Club where the food and service were up to the usual high standard. Will definitely return."
4,"Visited as a guest in the restaurant for lunch just a month ago, it was just two of us and enjoyed the indoor table. We decided to stay indoors - to enjoy the aircon 😊. We just wanted to say that, in addition to a nice meal, we had a delightful waitress, which i forgot her name. She had just the right balance of friendliness and efficiency. She recognized that we wanted time to visit and did not rush us. She and other staff members made certain that we had everything we needed. And most important actually they understood that we would have a privacy and they even not asked us many question during lunch. It was a really Amazing services and for sure will be back to stay there again in the near future"

Great location for early morning walks and later peace and quiet on the glorious beach.  Hoping to return soon "
5,"We stayed for 5 nights and this place is magic and huge! The location is next to a large shopping mall with lots of eating options, reasonably priced. The resort has a huge swimming pool (s) and is exceptionally clean and organised with really great staff. Only tip is to avoid the cheap rooms, they still have nice views but I would recommend paying a bit extra for sea views and more space."
4,"Stayed there for one night with my mum. Its a 5 stars hotel but I just realized that the staffs were not so friendly. I’m working at a hotel in Bali as well and I know how we greet our guests in a very friendly way that makes the guest feel welcomed.  Besides, our room was located very very far from the lobby and its like in the most corner location ever (with very little instruction). We were even lost in the evening when we tried to find where our room is and my mum’s feet was painful because we literally went around the building just to find our room. I would suggest to provide a small buggy to bring the guest to their room especially when they are old guests.  The room itself is quite big and could accommodate up to 4 people. Some toiletries will only be provided upon…"
5,"Stopped here for 1 night before going to Ubud. Very friendly staff and room was spacious.  Great pool area for the kids for toddler space and lazy river! Balinese dinner performance was superb!  Awesome 5-7 hr for Hyatt members, we truly enjoyed it! "
5,Unbelievable hotel. Incredible service and the staff are so polite and attentive. Had some concerns as I had never been out of Europe before and didn’t really not what to expect but I have been blown away but how nice the hotel is and how helpful the staff are. The food is outstanding and the cocktails are good too ;) would definitely come back and hoping too very soon

5,Although the hotel is one of the older hotels in Nusa Dua it has been well maintained and has the best out door recreation areas in the area. The real bonus is the staff that look after you as though you were family. The food is great and the pools are clean and atmosphere around the resort is totally relaxing. You will enjoy your stay at the Grand Hyatt.
4,We absolutely enjoyed our visit to Grand Hyatt Bali.  I was a bit concerned after some negative reviews but it was fantastic!  We booked through Luxury Escapes - and WELL worth the upgrade that included the 2x 1-hour massages!    Cons -  Slow service at pool for drinks and meals sometimes Pools close at 7 which is disappointing - after a big day it would be nice to have a little swim  Occasional language barriers -  Pricey restaurants but to be expected in the IDTC - research places just outside they are lovely  Breakfast buffet did not change - at all - can get a little repetitive - although has all you need The toiletries were a bit - cheap seeming.  The conditioner just didn't do the job.  Having said that - my son liked the scent so much he brought home a set.  Pros - …
2,Nice but not nice enough. Better service needed when we had difficulty with where we had been checked in we had to go out of our way to resolve opposed to the hotel staff and laberynth propety makes getting around a challenge.
3,"The resort grounds are beautiful and there are many swimming pools,we loved the lagoon pool.However we were disappointed with the rooms which were very old and the bathroom had a smell.Would definitely come back if the rooms were renovated.We got the Club Access benefits but did not realise that with the Club Access we could only have breakfast at the Club lounge itself and not at the main restaurant."
5,Just returned from my forth stay at Grand Hyatt Bali and as good as ever.  Amazingly beautiful resort with THE most friendly and attentive staff.  Sets a very high standard and in a class of its own.  We love it!!!  Will certainly be back again.

2,"Only grand hyatt lounge where you cannot help yourself with a bottle of water and a can of coke. They hide everything in the lounge. Moreover, they re-use a coke can - like they put ice in a glass and pour the coke from can inside. Whatever is left back is kept open and served to the next person. You will never get the coke can. Alcohol in club lounge is never visible - they pour it inside and get it for you. So you never know what you are drinking. The nepalese owner of this place is extremely dirty and stingy - else, the location etc of the hotel is extremely good. One exception, Mr. Urip in club lounge is exceptional. Wiji is the worst. "
5,Beautiful resort with well kept grounds that seem to go on forever. Pools are so inviting and calming all while being right on the beach front. Breakfast buffet could see you through the day.  Rooms are cleaned each day with bottled water supplied in an eco friendly way. You have to leave the empty bottle out to get a new one so they can recycle. Food stuff Bali !
3,If you are traveling with your family then I think you might enjoy this resort.  But if you're looking for peace and quiet this isn't the place.  We booked a 6 night stay and left after 2 nights for the Intercontinental.   The guest services personal are in serious need of some training.  And don't bother paying extra for an ocean view room because you will be disappointed.
5,"This is my first trip to Bali, and I brought my kids with me. I requested for a room with twin beds, which I found out later is 2 single beds, which are smaller than usual queen/super single beds. Next time I would request for a king bed room. Lucklily the day bed are huge, which the hotel convert to a sleeping area.   Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua is huge.. There are 4 clusters of rooms, each cluster is 4-5 stories. In all our 7 days there we did not manage to explore the whole area fully. There are clusters of shops, banks which still open at night, and section for Kriya Spa. The gardens are carefully curated everyday, and the beach are clean, lined with leafy trees to minimise sunburns.   The only downside is that once you are here, you don't want to leave to explore Bali. "
5,"This resort is very big compare other resort from 2000 year era, in this btdc i think is still keep in perfect condition, friendly front desk staff, fast check in , spacious room, good water supply quality for bathroom without salt taste, deep sleep , quiet, natural, clean private beach, delicious gelato ice cream, near bali colection so you can choice many restaurant, value 9/10"
2,"Only grand hyatt lounge where you cannot help yourself with a bottle of water and a can of coke. They hide everything in the lounge. Moreover, they re-use a coke can - like they put ice in a glass and pour the coke from can inside. Whatever is left back is kept open and served to the next person. You will never get the coke can. Alcohol in club lounge is never visible - they pour it inside and get it for you. So you never know what you are drinking.

5,"I have just returned from an 8 night stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali resort. We absolutely loved it! The breakfast was great, the grounds, gardens, the room, the swimming pools, the hotel beach were all exceptional, well maintained and clean.  The staff was very friendly and pleasant. The resort's location is also important, as you can just simply walk (2-3 minute walk) to Bali Collection for dinner every night. We will be coming back."
5,"We just spent 8 nights at this marvelous hotel and could not be more pleased.   Our room was large and included a private balcony.  The hotel is located right on the beach and surrounded by immaculate grounds, ponds, gardens and trees.  The Nusa Dua location is ideal.......such a calm, quiet and clean area compared to the traffic and chaos   In much of Bali.  Directly outside the hotel’s entrance is the Bali Collection shopping mall.......a nice area for walking with shops and  many restaurant choices.  We had the buffet breakfast each morning in the Garden Cafe with a wide variety of excellent choices and terrific service from the staff........especially Ms. Yumi!  Also enjoyed several dinners at Salsa Verde.......great Italian food and live music.  In summary, I can’t think of…"
5," Club access was the best choice we made during our stay. Personalised expedited check in, beautiful welcome drinks and professional staff. The hotel is very secure with great security, the pool is great for kids and Hotel is very close to shopping (Bali Collection) and beach. Rooms are clean and staff are friendly. Very good value. "
1,"Visited in October and stayed for 3 nights, while the grounds of the resort are well kept and quite expansive this cannot be said for the rooms.    Very dated and I have to say not well cleaned!  For the cost there are better options close by that offer much better accommodation, we added the Grand Club experience to our stay and thank goodness for that (an additional $80 per night).    The room with an ocean view was overrated and to be honest if you are wanting a view you would need to venture to either the 2nd or 3rd floor rooms.   The pool was also disappointing given that it closed at 7pm and the bar service was limited.    Having said this the food was excellent at the hotel and the staff were friendly.   Given the rooms we won’t be coming back.  "
5,"All of the staff at the hotel were wonderful people and seemed to genuinely care about their guests in the same way that your gardeners genuinely care for the beautiful gardens.  The gentleman who checked us in at World of Hyatt was very kind and he remembered us at check out.  Although there was a delay checking in due to it being just on 3.00 pm, he kindly gave us a drink to enjoy in the beautiful Verandah lobby bar, and we were not stressed at all. We  want to especially recommend staff member Yunita for her excellent service throughout and for making Helen's birthday so very memorable.  Also Padma who was in contact before we arrived and helped answer many questions.  And a huge acknowledgement to Puspa our housekeeper who was very caring and seamlessly kept our room in…"

4,Was such a beautiful venue but the only thing is that the facilities are very expensive yoga/massage/kids club etc and also there is no music in any of the pool areas but we did get a complimentary massage with luxury escapes and it was soo deluxe 
5,"Simply perfect. I loved it. Pools, access to the beach, food quality and food diversity, room quality, friendliness of staff. It is truly a great place. It is pricey but worth it. If you like birds, take your binoculars. Great bird-watching place."
5,"One of the best vacations I could have asked for and it was heightened by the wonderful stay at Grand Hyatt. We got a room facing the ocean.which was one the best the hotel could offer. Beautiful sunrises, idyllic days, captivating sunsets and relaxing by the beach and gorging on delicious food was the itinerary."
2,"Rooms are terrible falling apart, food was bland, guest services and check in staff including duty managers were rude and argumentative. Not much is done to sort anything you complain about unless you want to spend even more money. Dissatisfied for Grand Hyatt. Grounds are very scenic and Preety to look out and well kept but that is as far as it goes. Real shame I was gutted to be so unhappy."
3,For a 5 star hotel was a little dissapointed in service. Everyone was kind but could not speak english. Took a very long time for check in. Beautiful resort but lobby is extremely far away. I have had better service in a smaller resort. I think i was in the wrong room but because no one understood i did not bother to dispute. Beautiful hotel beautiful staff. But was dissapointed for a 5 star resort.

5,"Great location, great facilities and super friendly staff ensuring that our long weekend stay was superb. We stayed 4 nights in a Club Room which is super good value for money. Coming to Bali is always a treat - but staying at the Grnad Hyatt makes it an extra special experience. Well done to everyone at the hotel.  "
2,Stayed for 7nights. Took the package with breakfast but there was hardly anything for vegetarians.pathetic to be precise. Even simple wedges were not refilled inspite of asking for it though it was in the menu of 29th October 2019 . Found the room service boy very reluctant to give extra water bottle.  We take holidays every year and always stay in 5star but this was the worst experience ever. Even the room service menu do not give much vegetarian choice. Highly disappointed .
2,Nice property without any recreation activities. The property has different type of restaurants though service is not good. If travelling with teen ager avoid it.  As the property is very big hence better to stay in wing 2 which is near to beach . They do not have any activities to keep you engaged.
4,"5 minute walk to Bali Collection, best beach in Nusa Dua. The hotel gardens are beautiful and expansive. Friendly staff. Only negative is that there is no ""adults only"" pool area. The kids have several pools including ""Kids Club"". There is a small secluded pool area close to the Club Lounge - this should be dedicated to ""adults"" only. For this reason only do I award a 4 out of 5 for this hotel."
5,Couldn’t fault anything 😬Our stay was so enjoyable 👌🏻Facilities were 5 star🙌🏻 Highly recommended 👌🏻 We booked through Luxury Escapes and the value was incredible// so many vouchers to experience what the resort had to offer 👌🏻👌🏻

5,"We keep on coming back since years as this is one of our favorite place. The staff is very friendly and the garden is lush and beautiful. Food and service is excellent. Although the Hotelroom Interior is already quite some years old, you don't mind as you will be in a good mood thanks to the overall great experience and wonderful premises. "
5,"I have been wanting to sample the Grand Hyatt Bali for many years but my previous attempts, the hotel was fully booked. Was happy to finally get the chance for this particular trip. Overall the experience was fantastic. The hotel, facilities and location in particular were the main high points for the hotel. The rooms, whilst showing its age, were in good shape and state of cleanliness. Although, the rooms were a bit on the smaller side and not as per the usual ""Hyatt"" sized rooms that we were usually used to. The service is as expected of the Hyatt brand whilst the food was generally very tasty. That being said, the only disappointment is the breakfast spread. It unfortunately ranks the lowest of the breakfast spreads that we have enjoyed on previous stays with other hotels in…"
2," So disappointed.   At the core a badly run hotel with  good staff   Check in - Check in took a very long time even though the number of front desk staff out numbered those checking in!   The vouchers for our package were not ready and in the end the process took in excess of 30 minutes!  Package vouchers - this hotel offers a lot of packages for meal plans, massages and more.   Be careful!  The front desk got the vouchers for our package wrong and when I called to complain the woman on the phone talked over me and told me I was wrong.   Be careful- before u confirm any package with this hotel take a photo of what is included before confirming the reservation.   Our confirmation was different than what we displayed before the confirmation process and this was on the Hyatt…"
5,A beautiful property with magnificent gardens located in a manicured gated community. Great service adds to a great performance overall. It might be best to check on school holiday timings if you want quiet use of the pools.
4,"Hello Hyatt Team,  I just want to share about my stay in you resort a few weeks ago. My stay was very beautiful and wonderfull. I am so happy and can’t forget about my stay in your resort. You have a beautiful resort with full of kindness staff, your staff was very friendly.  During my check in and check out process, Patrick and Michelle was very awesome for handling us. But so sad, i need to say if the one who escorted us to the room and send our luggage to the room, does not know much about the resort. I mean about what is the promotion on going in the resort, do you have some happy hour or not. But its fine, i know that and its gonna be happen to everybody also. Regarding that, we have to go around the resort and asking about the promotion on goin and about the happy hour…"

5,Could have done with full board deal as it is very expensive to eat and drinking the hotel. However very nice shopping parade just opposite the main gate with lots of restaurant to choose from. Prices are very similar to paying in Uk in shopping parade. Had a little incident with regards to drinking water however soon rectified the situation with the assistant manager. Will definitely stay at this hotel if ever we go back to Bali. Their photos of the rooms on the web are not as described.
2,The setting of the restaurant was gorgeous. That is where it stops. The meal was ordinary to say the least. The chef was very friendly and seemed to know what he was doing. We were the only couple st the Teppsnyaki table and they rushed us through the meal like there was no tomorrow. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. Put a bit of a downer on our trip
5,Stunning grounds with so many pools! Traditional balinese style decor and buildings - which I love. An older hotel but beautifully kept. I love how close it is to the beaches of Nusa Dua. A great family hotel as there is something for everyone.
4,"I was most excited to visit this one in Nusa Dua after seeing the pictures and reviews. And no doubt the hotel has the infrastructure to call it one of the best resorts available in Nusa dua area , but staff is a problem .  It started with the check in . Throughout Bali hotels the check in time is 2 pm and accordingly we reached the resort at 1:55 pm and there was ms Michelle to attend to is who said that the check in time was 3pm in here . I checked my voucher and she was right I did not read carefully, so I politely requested her for an early check in .. she said it’s not possible. I could see at least 3-4 guests who were allowed early check ins but for some strange reason she denied mine . She told me about the east wing where my room is and rooms are still getting ready .

5,One word: Superb!! Actually it’s two words: super amazing. Thank you guys so much for the wonderful service. Keep it up! Will definitely visit again soon and recommend this to my family and some friends. Kudos to y’all!!

5,"The Grand Hyatt is a sprawling resort set in amazing well maintained grounds. The common areas including restaurants, bars, pools are very well maintained and in excellent condition. The room was not maintained to the same standard. We had 2 interconnecting rooms. The rooms were large by hotel standards with large bathrooms and Walk in robes but were dated and not well maintained with an air conditioner that did not function properly and a bar fridge that did not keep drinks cold. The food at the restaurants was great. There are multiple bars to choose from. We particularly liked the Verandah Bar and the rooftop Salsa Bar with amazing beach views.  We enjoyed breakfast each morning at salsa verde overlooking the beach.   The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful but at…"
5,"Everything about the Grand Hyatt Bali exceeded my expectations.  It is a huge beautiful sprawling resort with gorgeously maintained gardens, ponds and pools.  My room in the Club section was just lovely, large, traditionally furnished clean and welcoming.  My terrace looked towards the wonderful Club lounge area and also overlooked a large pond full of fish and other wildlife.  Just fabulous.  The Club Experience itself couldn't have been better from the attentive staff to the delicious breakfast and drinks and substantial canapes in the evening.  I will most certainly return to the Grand Hyatt Bali next year, well done!"
4,"Pros: The Lagoon setting, gardens and pools are excellent, the size of the gardens and pools ensure you can always find a spot to relax. The swimming pools are huge and interesting as they meander through the gardens, with some fun slides for the kids. The gardens are kept immaculate and attract some of the friendly wildlife, such as birds and aquatic monitor lizards. The ponds are also stocked Koi Carp and other fish.  Food. Is excellent from International breakfast to Italian dishes including pizzas and other Italian classics, to Balinese local dishes and a buffet. They also do some very nice cocktails.  Staff. Are very friendly and helpful. Beach. Is large and clean. Entertainment and water sports are very good including windsurfing, and bicycle hire  Cons: Hotel is large so…"

5,Waking up to see the ocean was amazing. The check in process was seamless and the hotel immaculate. I wish I had spent a little more time enjoying the pools. It was reasonably priced and breakfast had a wide spread to meet everyone's needs.

4,"It is a famous hotel in Bali.  As we all want some good rest and sunbath, we choose this one.    They have many facilities good for families and friends.  We went during holiday time so it is quite a bit crowded."
4,"Would definitely go back. The grounds were like being in paradise. Large rooms, comfortable bed. Hotel is showing a little age, having said that everything worked well. Drinks a bit pricey, food ok but I don’t think Hyatt is known for its food."
2,"First of all the room I stayed which was sea view King size. The price I gave USD230 per night; in return the room is very poor. TV Table is very old, TV size small and old, Tea/Freeze cabinet old and, Bed old. In toilet slippery, water speed is very poor. not clean due to old and not maintained properly. I never expected to have this type of room. I stayed in Sofitel from 13th to 16th, room is very clean and comfortable. "
5,We didn't stay here but the atmosphere in this place was just amazing! Hotel elegance meets Bali ambience and nature scenery. We wanted to go through the hotel grounds to get to the Waterblow site and we were allowed to go through the gardens to the beach walk. The walk from here to the Waterblow is a treat in itself.
5,"Great family holiday location. Safe, clean resort with A1 customer service.  Maybe slightly dearer than other resorts but worth every cent in my opinion. Water slide keeps kids occupied for hours. Nearby shopping centre (Bali Collection) has some great eateries and shops. If you want more bargain style shopping though, take a 30 min taxi ride (approx AU$12) to Kuta or Legian.  Would highly recommend this destination and resort for families or couples. "

4,"Would definitely go back. The grounds were like being in paradise. Large rooms, comfortable bed. Hotel is showing a little age, having said that everything worked well. Drinks a bit pricey, food ok but I don’t think Hyatt is known for its food."
2,"First of all the room I stayed which was sea view King size. The price I gave USD230 per night; in return the room is very poor. TV Table is very old, TV size small and old, Tea/Freeze cabinet old and, Bed old. In toilet slippery, water speed is very poor. not clean due to old and not maintained properly. I never expected to have this type of room. I stayed in Sofitel from 13th to 16th, room is very clean and comfortable. "
5,We didn't stay here but the atmosphere in this place was just amazing! Hotel elegance meets Bali ambience and nature scenery. We wanted to go through the hotel grounds to get to the Waterblow site and we were allowed to go through the gardens to the beach walk. The walk from here to the Waterblow is a treat in itself.
5,"Great family holiday location. Safe, clean resort with A1 customer service.  Maybe slightly dearer than other resorts but worth every cent in my opinion. Water slide keeps kids occupied for hours. Nearby shopping centre (Bali Collection) has some great eateries and shops. If you want more bargain style shopping though, take a 30 min taxi ride (approx AU$12) to Kuta or Legian.  Would highly recommend this destination and resort for families or couples. "
5,Second time at the Grand Hyatt and the standard as just as good if not better than last time. Few minor hiccups towards the end but overall it was wonderful. We took my in laws as they were first time travelers to Bali. They said it was better than they imagined. 
5,"Lovely hotel with established gardens, plenty of shade, and excellent catering to dietary requirements (we had two gluten free people in our group). Our room was spacious with a beautiful private garden outside the room, the children loved playing in the garden, swimming in the huge pool, the water slides and huge selection at breakfast."
3,"Our family and friends stayed here in early October for 4 nights and I was really disappointed.  Considering the cost for the 4 nights I really did expect more.  To start with, the check in process was lengthy - I think it took us 20 minutes to check in.....not ideal when you have a 4 and 8 year old who were busting to get to the pool.  When we eventually got to our rooms (we had to wait a couple of ours until our room was ready) the 2 interconnecting rooms were in the West Wing of the resort, at the bottom of the 3 levels and right opposite the housekeeping services area (which made the rooms noisy as staff were coming and going at all hours).   We also had a family in the room above us who made alot of noise late at night and then first thing in the morning.  We have kids and…"
5,Stayers here 3 nights...the club lounge was really nice..nice employees....great beach Beach 9/10.... big beach and enough chairs...great Sea 7/10.... warning sign for yelly fish....the sea was not really good for swimming  Room....9/10.... got a nice room with a great view... pity the ammenities of the bathroom were poor and the sandals too.... Club lounge 10/10.... nice place...nice employees.... Swimming Pools...were great But litlle bit busy...But swimming pool club lounge was great.... I enjoyed my star...good price/quality if you go for the club room
1,We took a Luxury escape package staying at the Grand Hyatt  ( we did the same last year and Jimbaran Bay and it was brilliant) . just trying to get our transfer sorted took 5 days of constant communication.   When we arrived they had no reference of the upgrade we had paid for. The room was dirty with human left in it  to greet us .   This is a big resort but there is no detailed written information ( in the room or anywhere else for that matter) on exactly what his here and how to find it.  When things open to when they close - from the restaurants to the fitness or business centre  .  The little map they give you is just hopeless.   This just reeks of bad management - the staff just won't take responsibility - it is always someone else's problem.    Just hopeless - we won't be…

5,"Good, big room and bath room   Very well maintained and nicely flowered resort. Large main pool area. Great service also at the beach. Additional pools available. Nice small lakes. Warm people. Very friendly service. Great restaurants. Salsa Bar a great place to watch the sunset Large beach. Great for swimming. During low tide a short walk to deeper water is needed. A country, the people, the location to be revisited. "
5,"Traveled here with my wife for our 20th anniversary from the moment we arrived we was blown away,everything was just what we expected from Bali. Everything was perfect we cant fault anything  Will be returning"
5,"Hotel is wonderful. Old but very well maintained. Best position in Nusa Dua. As a 5-star hotel in Bali, the spa, food and drinks are similar to the prices charged in big Australian cities but you always get more value (60 Min massage turn into at least 90min experience), food and drinks are better presented and service is excellent. We had an upgraded packaged with lots of inclusions, so it was a great value. If we had to pay for all food, drinks, massage, transportation etc, it would be more costly and definitely less enjoyable because I would think twice before paying for a 136k+21% taxes which is about AUD170 for a 60-min massage and would probably give it a miss. Glad 3 massages were included, they were wonderful and additional massages came 30% discounted. Teppaniak in the…"
5,"Couldn’t have asked for more, everything about our stay was magical. The Lobby is spectacular, the pools are spacious, varied and plentiful and the club rooms with the associated club benefits are well worth getting."
5,"I would highly recommend this hotel. The hotel with its grounds is absolutely stunning. It's feels like you are walking through a botanical garden on the sites of the hotel. My son was fascinated with all animals, birds and giant lizards we met there. There are numerous swimming pools with a fun slide on the territory of the hotel. Even though there were a lot of people during our stay the hotel didn't seem to be crowded. Our family had club room and it was worth paying extra as we had separate checking zone, restaurant where we could enjoy our diverse breakfast and afternoon drinks contemplating Koi fish and exotic birds, there was even separate swimming pool in a quite area. I would emphasize on how helpful was the staff, when my husband got sick. We got a few phone calls next…"

5,This is the best hotel we stayed at. The grounds are so big and just stunning. The waterslide for the kids (small and big) is super fun and the layout of the pools is really great. We will definitely come back!
4,"Great family resort, food was excellent but as you would expect very expensive then the two taxes added on.  Staff are fantastic and very helpful if they understood english.  When checking into your room need to make sure the aircon is working.  Bali collection which is over the road which has shops and restaurants.  It was good to go to Kuta, Seminyak Legian and Ubud with all the hussle and bustle and shopping of course but even better coming back to a lovely and somewhat family friendly resort."
4,"It was a beautiful experience all together. The grounds of the hotel are by far the best I have seen, immaculately maintained with something for everyone. Very nice beach with variety of water sport activities is another one to mention. Although the rooms are slightly dated, it is compensated by the comfortable bed and immaculate room service. Our balcony overlooked the water lily pond which gave such a sense of serenity and beautiful way to start the day. The hotel is more family oriented, I.e if you want to dance the salsa away in the salsa bar, it is very quiet. I liked it as I returned home very well rested. Spa in the hotel is a must, beautiful, very professional, one to remember. A few comments, more constructive than negative: yoga classes prominently featuring among the…"
5,"If you are over the crowds and transport chaos, the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua is just perfect for a relaxed holiday in immaculately kept and very beautiful grounds.  Superb staff.  Excellent food. Beautiful beach and pools.   "
5,"Grand Hyatt was the first hotel I stayed at in Bali all those years ago. Having travelled to most of Western European countries, lots of Cities in the US, Japan, Hong Kong, I feel that even as a kid, I am well learned of the resort and hotel scene. The first time I set foot on this resort, it was paradise. The grounds was massive, the rooms were spacious, the pool was truly one of a kind, best one on the planet.   That, was in the 90's. We visited this hotel again sometime in 1998, and last week, I wanted to share this nostalgic moment and took my kids and wife to try 3 nights on this property.  I was not without my worries, as 21 years can really put down some wear and tear to a property. I didn't realise they did a huge renovation back in 2009, and when we got to the lobby…"

4,Very good lots of nice pools and waterslides.Room clean and larger than most with additional day bed in corner that could fit 2 small children or adult.Only one negative that there was no games room or anything for teenagers and no beach or pool sports so older kids got a bit bored but great for young as have kids club  but you have to pay .
5,"This is a wonderful hotel the setting on a wonderful beach,the gardens are amazing set around pools and lakes filled with the biggest carp I have seen.We had a basic room but it was like a suite filled with lots of extras. A lovely choice of restaurants and the service amazing nothing too much trouble."
3,"Direct access to beach and a big pool (1.2m depth throughout). Make sure your name is registered properly when checking in or you won’t be able to connect to wifi (scan does a terrible job). When in the room for the first time, check that everything works properly (tv, ac, etc). "
4,We went here at the end of 3 weeks travelling round Bali with our children and it was heaven. So clean and our room was really lovely and so big and well equipped. The pool's are lovely and pretty good poolside service. The grounds are lovely and there's a water slide which was great fun. The beach is lovely too and so nice to just walk out to. The only reason I give this 4 stars rather than 5 is because the service in the restaurants lets it down - it just doesn't feel the same standard as the rest of Bali. The staff weren't as friendly or polite and eating and drinking here is very expensive. You could also be anywhere in the world staying in a resort like this. It's not a real taste or Bali and you're not experiencing what the amazing Bali is really like.
5,"I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt, Nusa  Dua for the past three years and I must say that I will not stay in another hotel inBali because this hotel is excellent in all ways, from the hotel itself and the accommodation and the facilities.  The staff are second too none and always more than happy to help you in anything you want.  You must try this hotel and you will see what I mean, just outstanding in all ways.

5,"We stayed here for 2 nights and couldn't love our experienced better! The feeling of little paradise that the resort gave us was so surreal. Amazing breakfast spots, super comfy room and we also got the chance to enjoyed pasar senggol dinner on our second night. Would really love to comeback!"
2,"We found the grounds and gardens lovely, but the food and value for money extremely disappointing.  Unfortunately we would not come back here but look for another resort closer by with closer access to the beach. "
5,"Wow! This resort is something else. Great location, spacious rooms, excellent food and the most pristine gardens and pool area in Nusa Dua. Had a fabulous time and staff from check in to checkout were very helpful and pleasant to interact with. Would highly recommend staying at this resort when in Bali.  "
4,"We've just come back from 8 nights at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua and we would go back in a heartbeat.  So relaxing and tranquil.. Our first trip there was in 1998 and since then, the gardens have flourished and looking so beautiful. The hotel is showing it's age but we are told renovation/upgrade is happening soon. Staff at the hotel were great as expected and food/drinks on site were good too. Their spa,  Kriya Spa has spoilt us and would be hard pressed to find anything as good. Bring on the reno, we will be one of the first to try it out."
3,"I booked this hotel as it looked ideal great rooms, great view. Which it had but a few down sides. I booked to be collected at the airport when I arrived the driver wasn’t there had to ask at information. Had booked a ocean view grand club room, I arrived after dark only to find in the morning I didn’t have a ocean view, they quickly moved me rooms (but shouldn’t have happened). The room I moved to looked great but when I went to bed that night the bed smelled I changed to pillow. When I got up In the morning there was hair in the bed that wasn’t mine obviously they hadn’t changed the sheets before I got the room.   The hotel fixed all the issues quickly but I’m sure there would be main other hotels in that area that this would happen in.  I have rated it a 3 for the location…"

5,"The resort is huge, great for walks around to check out the gorgeous scenery. The grounds of the resorts are well maintained with beautiful flowers, colours, statues, offerings, lily pads, koi carp, architecture the list goes on and on.  We used the spa and wowzer!!! We did a couples 4 hour spa! Emmmm hmmmm so worth every penny and there aren't quite the words to express how good it was. The spa is out of this world, looks so tranquil, the design alone blew my mind. The staff go out of their way to make it special and there are hidden doors they take you through to have your treatment. At the end of your treatment you can relax, have fruit and refreshments that just add to your experience.  We stayed in a king delux room with lagoon view. The bed was spacious and had room for…"
5,"We visited for 10 nights in September for our honeymoon. I would highly recommend - the hotel, service, food were all excellent; it is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. We stayed in the Grand Club - I would very much recommend this also, have own restaurant for breakfast, food and aperitifs everyday from 5pm-7pm and a swimming pool which are all less busy than other parts of the hotel. Great location, on the beach and a shopping centre opposite the hotel. Would like to come back again for sure ☺"
5,"This is my third visit to Grand Hyatt Nusa’ Dua. I spent the extra in a Club Room and was not disappointed. Larger, better equipped rooms, views to the beach and the Club rooms have their own eating breakfast coffee and drinks all day and happy hour in the evening included. Very happy with the visit."
5,"What a FABULOUS PROPERTY!! Peaceful, serene, quiet. OMG. WE WILL BE BACK. Make sure you stay in the East Village and you’ll have access to the Grand Club. Ask for Mr. Ureep. He is FANTASTIC!  The spa is awesome as well. Great food. Do the dinner show also. Well worth it. Thank you Hyatt!!!"
4,This is our second trip to Grand Hyatt. We have booked our trip with Luxury Escapes and have many incisions which has been nice. The hotel staff and hotel facilities are 5 star. We were at the hotel for my sons birthday and they went to all lengths to make him feel special which was lovely. They even gave him a present! The only negative I would say is that while most of our meals were included for 2 adults we found that we were still spending minimum of $60 AUD a day for our kids meals and drinks. It is still reasonable but just be prepared for this.  Also I have stayed at alot of 5 star resorts around the world and unfortunately 5 stars also brings some Chinese and Indian guests who believe they are entitled to push in and demand that they are held in a higher class than…

3,"This is a beautiful property BUT I wouldn't call it 5 star..No room amenities that you would expect in the other properties nearby like Hilton, Conrad or Westin. It's beach front but there aren't any beach slippers. They did suggest where you can buy them though. Air conditioning is malfunctioned since our arrival at midnight and I was too tired to have repairs done. Now I'm wasting precious time waiting for the engineers to work in my room when I should be out on the beach. Not sure about the other rooms, but I'm at the West Village, room 4213. I've stayed at the Nikko, Conrad and Westin in Nusa Dua before and they are much better. So think twice if the prices are similar"
4,"Overall our Grand Hyatt experience was a good one.  We loved the resort and our room. The size and layout worked well for our family.  I would say that the hotel and its facilities are genuine 5 star but service levels of many staff were not to the same standard. (House keeping excepted, they were brilliant).  "
5,"My first trip to Bali and what a stay. The Grand Hyatt is a beautiful resort with the most incredible customer service. Stayed for a week with the family (2 adults, a 9 year old boy, and an infant girl) and relaxed well. Summary points:  Loved: - fantastic customer service every step of the way - beautiful grounds - well maintained rooms and property - good dining options and delicious food - plenty of staff available quickly - services readily available (e.g. a reliable babysitter, transport, spa)  Things to consider: - food and drink are expensive for Bali (but this is standard at the resorts in Nusa Dua) - property is HUGE... this is only a con because trying to get place to place with the little ones was an adventure, however most rooms are close to a pool and the resort is…"
4,Beautiful Resort and service was exceptional - Rooms do need renewal though. Food was plentiful. Overall had an memorable experience and would recommend. Gardens and surrounding set the scene to relax and was stuuning
5,"We had a great time during our holiday in Grand Hyatt hotel in Nusa Dua Bali. We stayed for a week celebrating our kids birthday. We had upgraded to have access to Grand Club that includes breakfast, happy hours drink and food, club swimming pool, etc. Grand Hyatt management surprised our kids with some gifts and birthday cake which was really lovely and made our trip even more memorable. Forgot to mention this was our second time in Grand Hyatt, we will definitely come back :) Thanks to all staff in particular the Grand Club team."

I've stayed at the Nikko, Conrad and Westin in Nusa Dua before and they are much better. So think twice if the prices are similar"
4,"Overall our Grand Hyatt experience was a good one.  We loved the resort and our room. The size and layout worked well for our family.  I would say that the hotel and its facilities are genuine 5 star but service levels of many staff were not to the same standard. (House keeping excepted, they were brilliant).  "
5,"My first trip to Bali and what a stay. The Grand Hyatt is a beautiful resort with the most incredible customer service. Stayed for a week with the family (2 adults, a 9 year old boy, and an infant girl) and relaxed well. Summary points:  Loved: - fantastic customer service every step of the way - beautiful grounds - well maintained rooms and property - good dining options and delicious food - plenty of staff available quickly - services readily available (e.g. a reliable babysitter, transport, spa)  Things to consider: - food and drink are expensive for Bali (but this is standard at the resorts in Nusa Dua) - property is HUGE... this is only a con because trying to get place to place with the little ones was an adventure, however most rooms are close to a pool and the resort is…"
4,Beautiful Resort and service was exceptional - Rooms do need renewal though. Food was plentiful. Overall had an memorable experience and would recommend. Gardens and surrounding set the scene to relax and was stuuning
5,"We had a great time during our holiday in Grand Hyatt hotel in Nusa Dua Bali. We stayed for a week celebrating our kids birthday. We had upgraded to have access to Grand Club that includes breakfast, happy hours drink and food, club swimming pool, etc. Grand Hyatt management surprised our kids with some gifts and birthday cake which was really lovely and made our trip even more memorable. Forgot to mention this was our second time in Grand Hyatt, we will definitely come back :) Thanks to all staff in particular the Grand Club team."
5,"Had a very relaxing wonderful family holiday, my husband and two daughters aged 6 and 5 had a brilliant time and especially enjoyed kids club.  Food was great, particularly enjoyed Japanese Restaurant -  ate there twice during our 8 day stay. Resort grounds were spectacular,  we walked to and visited some nearby resorts and thought the grand Hyatt had the best grounds and gardens by far.  The pool(s) are big,  didn't feel crowded at all.  Guest rooms are a little dated but very comfortable and had everything we needed,  the day bed converted to a double bed for the girls was perfect. We really couldn’t fault anything on this trip,  very happy and definitely will be back! "
5,"Stayed at Grand Hyatt Bali for 8 nights 9 days through Luxury Escape. Wow, my first time staying at Nusa Dua. For us our stay was faultless. Food was amazing and staff so friendly and very helpful. Beaches are clean, pools are pristine and my highlight was the Kirya Spa. This experience will be with me for a long time. Shopping at Bali Connection was fantastic.  Love it all and thanks to all concerned."
1,"Water turned green yesterday, was told not dangerous, today pool closed due to chemical treatment...  Not completely convincing and no other information disclosed or available, claiming to open later but no one knows..."
1,"We arrived at midnight totally exhausted. The first thing that hit us was the smell. The ponds surrounding the area was awful.  Our room was not what we booked, a 2 bed twin room. Could be parted max 15cms! There were rat droppings in the room.  It was located 5 - 7 mins walk from the lobby & pool. Not clear in ads. The night manager was rude & would not let us contact Luxury Escapes.  We went back to the airport, waited till morning & found another Nusa Dua 5 star luxury hotel at the price this 1 star place.  Now the Grand Hyatt won't refund our money.  BEWARE!!  DON'T STAY HERE. IT'S NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURES THEY ADVERTISE"
1,"This hotel was filthy, shabby, and nothing like the photos in the ads which claimed a luxury experience.  Our room was not as booked, 2 bed twin room, it was located 5 - 7 mins walk from lobby & pool, the smell from the ponds surrounding the area was awful so we checked in at midnight & out at 12.45pm. The staff were rude & unhelpful(they wouldn't let us contact Luxury Escapes) so we returned to the airport, waited until morning & found another hotel.  Now Grand Hyatt won't refund our money!!! The hotel is nothing like a luxury experience & there are many 5 star hotels in Nusa Dua at this price. BEWARE   DONT STAY HERE"

5,"We had an excellent family holiday. Beautiful resort with amazing gardens. Friendly staff, fabulous service,great food and excellent kids club. Great destination for a family holiday. Waterslides are a big bonus for the kids"
5,"Beautifully decorated hotel , great choice of in house restaurants and outstanding food  . The rooms are comfortable and clean , and bathrooms have both shower and bath . The staff all spoke perfect English and are helpful and friendly. The pool areas have bar and restaurant service, and there’s plenty of shade and loungers . Nice choice of cocktails at reasonable prices . And a fabulous shopping centre across the road. The Spa is just superb . Definitely worth a stay ! "
1,The all rooms and suites are sooooooo old and bad smells.. Even the air conditioner need too be replaced by new... They must renew all the land scape soooo amazing the peach is good but need more service at the peach...
3,"We spent a week here and it was very pleasant. Friendly staff and a lovely Balinese Architecture but the hotel is dated and in need updating. Breakfast is much the same everyday in the 3 restaurants. We had the Balinese buffet on our 2nd night and we were very disappointed at the quality of their food, put us off dining in-house  for our entire stay. Rock hard beds,  It appears to be a hotel that’s being doing the same thing for too long, time for change."
1,"For the money spent I was extremely disappointed.  Upon check in I was told to sit for ""a moment"" then left for half an hour. When I asked what was happening with my room no one could tell me.  Room was tired and dirty. $300 was taken as a room deposit, which I was assured would be transferred back within 7, maximum 14 days after check out. It has now been almost a month, and I am advised it can take another 14 working days.  After confirming that breakfast was included in my rate I was charged $45 AU for breakfast (yogurt and fruit). Overall, terrible for the price. Don't waste your money, stay somewhere nicer. (The pool and bar staff were wonderful and I do not wish for this to reflect poorly on them in anyway.)"

2,"Disapointing! Booked two rooms through Luxury escapes. Unfortunately there is nothing luxury about this five star rated resort. Rooms are in desperate need of renovation, leaking toilet and mouldy cockroach infested bathrooms. We had a bad experience with one of our meals at the Garden cafe. Friendly staff offered us a free meal afterwards, which has also turned into a bit of a disaster. According to our waiter we were not the first customers to send their food back that night, dont understand why they continued to serve this dish.  I have never stayed at a resort where you can't get a bucket of ice at the pool to keep your drinks chilled, but this is a policy at Grand Hyatt. You only get ice if you buy four beers. As a guest at a five star rated resort, I dont want to beg for…"

4,"We stayed almost 2 weeks at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua and we loved it very much. Nice clean room and service with a smile 24/7. In particular we would like to mention the cub facility, Great staff, delicious food and great drinks. Thanks Mr. Urip and team for two wonderful weeks of relaxing. Also special thanks to Mr. Adi. (terima kashi). Next time we vist Bali we certainly stay at Grand Hyatt again.  Sampai waktu berikutnya,  Angelique & John"
3,Amazing equipment in the gym and super little adjacent pool for the sole use of gym goers. Huge steam room a little disappointing as it’s lovely and hot but not much stray. Lots of rusty nails on the ceiling dripping down water in your head. Showers are a massive waste of time as the shower heads are so clogged up the spray is everywhere but on you. Fantastic beach and loads of lovely swimming areas.

5,"Every single Bali Grand Hyatt team member was kind, polite and friendly, it didn’t matter if they were gardening staff, room service or restaurant staff - the level of service was truly outstanding. The dining experiences were incredible, the food was always of an excellent quality. The team at The Grand Hyatt have done an exceptional job to create a holiday environment of the highest standard, well done! It’s no wonder so many staff are still here since it opened in 1991, everyone seems very proud to work here and be part of the team. We will definitely return!"
5,"We had an awesome 8 day break at Grand Hyatt Bali, booked with Luxury Escapes which made everything very stress free. Using vouchers for meals, massages and drinks was super easy. All of the very friendly staff were across exactly what was available making for a very chilled out holiday for us and our 8 year old son. Juni looked after our room and housekeeping in our Lagoon View room and nothing was too much trouble for him. Sunbeds in the shade were plentiful, there was not one day when we didn't get a great shady spot poolside.  The resort is older in style so whilst not ""ultra-modern""; the food was fantastic and the open spaces, beautifully manicured gardens and multiple pool options made it the perfect Bali break. Lastly we LOVED our bed and had the best sleep! I wonder if…"
5,Stayed at Grand Hyatt for 6 days of pure luxury & peace. This hotel is beautiful & a pleasure to enjoy. The grounds are zen like so beautiful & tropical to completely relax & spend time in. The beach is beautiful - very quiet with a lovely refreshing breeze. The room was spacious with a truly enormous bed ! Our outside balcony overlooked a peaceful pond. The staff here are outstanding in their roles & commitment to providing quality service with dignity & style. Breakfast full of local & traditional food along with the more familiar choices. We ate at hotel a few times ( delicious can't fault anything) and also at a few  restaurants in local area. The food & presentation in Bali is very good.  Sincere thanks to everyone at Grand Hyatt we had a faultless beautiful stay ♥️
5,"From the beautiful gardens and ponds, to the good sized rooms and pools. You cant fault the Grand Hyatt Bali. A beautiful ,well maintained property with amazing asian themed gardens and ponds,lovely restaurants with an assortment of delicious foods and attentive happy and helpful staff. Also a spa centre to die for and all by the sea. Dont wait,just go!"
3,"We stayed at this hotel last week ,we booked  for  7 nights, but canceled after  3 nights, and so happy we did, this hotel has a beautiful lobby, and that's it, its too big, too much walking up and down, we like big resorts, but thatt's  just too much, room is not 5 star, and it's  about 3 star the most, and hotel is not 5 star either, hotel is like a dead zone, no reastaurants on a beach, ,no people, no life. i walked by Melia, Westin, Laguna, those are 5 stars and beautiful, i am so happy that we moved to hotel  next door **Inaya, I like Nusa dua, but will never go back to Hyatt, people are nice,** maid reception, kitchen**"

4,"We had just over a week here. Lovely hotel with fantastic swimming pools (think there were 5) plus a toddlers pool, cold plunge pool, jacuzzi and very close to the beautiful beach. Grounds immaculately kept, staff super friendly and helpful. We went as part of Luxury Escapes package and was well worth it. Pretty outlook. Great restaurants. Highly recommend.  "
4,"The Grand Hyatt at Nusa Dua has one of the loveliest landscaping in the area. A web of waterways topped by pink and white lilies and water-hyacinths flows throughout the entire property, fringed by brilliant bougainvillea bushes and bottle trees. The water laps up right against the back verandah of many ground floor units. You can easily spot rotund carps and sometimes, even a couple of monitor lizards splashing around. Rooms are large and spacious, fitted with auto air-conditioning sensors that shut off when you slide open the door to the balcony. Service is genial, attentive yet unobtrusive. Staff are very experienced - and I appreciate it. "
5,"We spend our 10th Anniversary at Grand Hyatt Bali, 5 nights 6 days from 28th February 2019 to 5th March 2019, everything was so so awesome. We booked through TRIPSAVR, we got 50% discount on room tariff as per app we have bought from QNET, we got sea facing balcony room. Rooms were awesome. Bed was the best I have experience in my life. Hospitality was great."
5,"Stayed there for a business conference and what a fantastic stay. Small stroll from your room straight onto the beach where you can walk for many kms, then return to the pool area for a meal or a swim. Restaurants within the hotel grounds are first class. Conference venues were user friendly, with great audio visual equipment."
4,"Overall we experienced the high quality service that is expected from a Hyatt Hotel. Would have preferred for housekeeping to attend to room earlier, as it was always well into the afternoon when they came around. "

5,"This was our 2nd stay here. Beautiful resort and even when full you can find peaceful places to relax. Very happy with our Luxury Escapes deal. We went to look at some other resorts and nothing compared to this for sheer beauty, tranquility and location "
4,"The staff are all amazing and can not do enough to make your stay enjoyable. The pool facilities and grounds are terrific. The room was very comfortable, we had an interconnectng room which accommodated the 4 Adults and 2 children well. The day bed is very large and could easily sleep 2 children if required."
5,"The staff were fantastic. Being a large resort, it is strange how the staff make you feel special and you feel like you are the only couple in the resort. The food was always fantastic. Most of our meals were at the Grand Club but we also dined at the Garden Café. We also enjoyed the views overlooking the ocean and tropical gardens. Being across the road from the Bali Collection Shopping Mall was also very convenient"
5,On our recent rerun to the Grand Hyatt we found that a considerable amount of time and effort has been spent on bringing the property back up to its old beautiful self. Also the staff were exceptional and the restaurants and food were terrific. Pools are a little dated but clean and lots of lounges with space and room for kids. Would highly recommend.
5,"Great family experience. We visited other hotels in area, but still think this may be best for kids. Food, people and general experience were brilliant. Hotel staff went above and beyond to help retrieve our lost baggage. The only minor negative is the rooms are slightly aged, although this is great if you are traveling with kids."

We enjoyed the Grand Club facilities and would certainly book a Club room again. Thank you for an awesome stay, particularly thank you to the wonderful staff."
5,"From the moment you walk in you are greeted with such kindness, the welcoming atmosphere is in keeping with the Balinese culture.  I upgraded to the ambassador suite which was absolutely stunning and throughout our 8 days there, the service levels, quality of food and general condition of the resort was outstanding! Nothing was a problem and the support and help provided, from check in to check out was seamless.   We used the baby creche a few hours a day, just superb, well looked after and most of all safe! We were cautious of using foreign child support but having completed existence research, they had all the tickets and were just lovely people.

5,Terri staff. They bent over backwards to help with everything. Beautiful gardens surrounding the pool. Great entertainment every night with a cultural show. Such a relaxing place if you want it that way or something to do in walking distance.
5,"We chose this hotel for the beach and we were not disappointed -- this stretch of Nusa Dua beach is wide, long, and uncrowded.    There is a constant sea breeze and lounge chairs are under sun-protecting trees.  The hotel is large but well laid out and everyone finds their corner.   The gardens are beautiful and well maintained.  A garden path meanders along all the hotels by the beach, which makes for nice walks.   Staff at the hotel is wonderful.  Our room team laid out a beautiful flower petal welcome on the bed for our wedding anniversary.   We tried all the restaurants -- best was the Balinese dinner and dance, disappointing was the Japanese Teppanyaki - much show, but so-so food.  The spa is definitely worth a visit because of its superb facilities and treatments.  We…"
5,"After a lot of research this hotel covers all needs for our family. They can confirm interconnecting rooms, location is better then any other resort in Nusa dua as a 5 minute walk to shopping at Bali collection which also has great eating places.

5,"Don’t let the oldness of this Hotel put you off! It’s a gem! Great staff! Beautiful gardens, numerous Pools to choose from. Even a water slide! The gym is fully decked out! We have stayed at many Bali hotels but this one is a favourite. We would love to return!"
5,Could not fault this place. Great choice of restaurants. Amazing Balinise hospitality. Great for couples that want to get away and relax. Only a 2 Minute walk from Bali collection. Will definitely be back again in November. 
4,"Bring back my childhood memories. Been here 8-9 years ago. All details remaind the same but still be maintained. No major finding. The difference on toilet, my last visit type of toilet still dry, no water on closet. Now the have water closet. Sadly, not all toiletries available at toilet, you need to ask first (toothbrush for example).  I came for business trip, stay at north wing, not far from breakfest area, also pool near from my room. Type of peaceful hotel that i loved. Breakfasts, typical of hyatt, perfect with very nice hospitality.  One of affordable hotel cost at Nusa Dua area. They have private beach and many green garden spot. You need call help if you lost haha since this hotel area are sooooo huge. Parking area, need to ask if we can park at vip park, parking area…"
5,Loved the relaxing atmosphere. Didn't feel the need to leave the resort as everything we needed was there already. The gym was handy and facilities there were good. Beautiful beaches at Nusa Dua. Would go back again in a heartbeat. Loved it. Fantastic customer service. Romantic dinner on the beach for my fiance's 50th birthday was a highlight. Our waiter Suardicka was a lovely young man. Can't wait to return there.

4,"Nestled within a well manicured compound surrounded by a host of amenities the Grand Hyatt Bali is the ultimate in superb business & pristine pleasure facilities… sort of a business resort with very friendly staff  While the room is huge and well furnished, notably the side sofa bed goes inwards lengthwise and can easily sleep 2 more  My biggest strangeness is their toothbrush/paste are only provided upon request and are not found in the bathroom and that's way different from a Hyatt of any brand least a Grand Hyatt  Staff in the shops were unattentive to the point where my wife was ignored till she asked for help  Nonetheless the property is relaxing and well appointed you will not be easily dissatisfied "
3,"It's a complete resort in every sense. From the beautiful beaches to the many restaurants to cultural events to a spa to a shopping center, the Grand Hyatt seldom gives you reason to step out if you are on a short stay.   Sadly, during our stay, the cons outweighed the otherwise beautiful and serene resort.   1. The room door needed maintenance and always closed with a bang and that was very inconvenient since it used to wake up our baby. 2. The shower in the bathroom often leaked. Had to wait for a while before it stopped 3. The heating kettle should have a dedicated plug near the mini bar. It was inconvenient to keep moving it to the nearest available socket 4. The quality of food was very disappointing. Pasar Senggol was a huge disappointment. The Cappuccino at Verandah was…"
5,perfect place for holyday makers its right at the sea. I recommend for travelers both business and vacation to use grant hyatt hotel. they gave me complimentary traditional bali massage. I rate it 9/10
5,"We just spent 8 relaxing & restful nights at the Grand Hyatt Resort Nusa Dua, Bali. I can only say that this was the most enjoyable & comfortable hotel stay we have experienced to date which has included Oahu Hawaii, Kuta, Koh Samui & the Sunshine Coast. Suffice to say that this establishment can be viewed on their website & nothing is over exaggerated in the least. Our room & king bed were excellent with a view over the beautiful landscaped gardens & pools. The service staff were extremely helpful & very professional in their dealings with us.The layout of the expansive manicured grounds are like a virtual paradise on earth which caters for families & couples alike. The daily breakfast routine was something to look forward to with nothing overlooked in the culinary arts…"
5,We had a club room facing the sea with full sea views. The room was a great size with a large bathroom and great rain head shower. The bed was comfy and large. We had a great balcony we could sit on and watch the sun sets while listening to the ocean. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The club experience is great where you get your own resort with in the resort. The breakfasts and cocktails are all wonderful.

5,Purchased a deal to Grand Hotel Nusa Dua via Luxury Escapes for a getaway with my wife. Previous trips to Bali we've stayed in the busier Kuta/Legian region so this was the first time in this area. What a perfect area to stay. You need a map to find your way around for the first day it's that big! We had several vouchers to use and it was made easier by being provided with a booklet to tear out and use. The daily buffet breakfast was top quality with lots of different foods from Indonesian soup broths to good ol' eggs and bacon. Nightly cocktails sitting at Salsa Bar overlooking the bay was a highlight as was eating a local food buffet while watching an Indonesian dance/story telling. I have to say the place was kept immaculately clean everywhere we went with people going around…
5,"Stayed 5 days in the Grand Club at the Grand Hyatt Bali. Super friendly staff and exceptional customer service especially by Mr. Urip the Grand Club Manager. Gorgeous white sand beach comparable to Maldives at a fraction of the price. Best and biggest pools in Bali (yes there are more than 5 pools and a water slide at the resort). Always come back annually for more than 25 years now. Even it is a very large resort with 1,000+ rooms it still feels surprisingly private which is due to the very large area it occupies and hotel guests spread out over whole resort. This is the best 5-star hotel in Bali conveniently located adjacent to Bali Collection open air shopping malls and alfresco restaurants of Nusa Dua. Will certainly be back next year for my 26th time."
5,"The hotel is carefully maintained, with love.  All his staff is attentive and very friendly.  It is a very familiar hotel where you can spend a fantastic holiday, have a lot of activities, the resort has 4 super nice pools, all the restaurants of the resort offer a super good meal.  It is the best resprt of lis we have been, do not hesitate to go."
2,"Staying here 2 nights for a two year anniversary. First night aircon not work properly, hardly any sleep then wake up with really sore back from hard mattress. Grounds and gardens of this hotel are beautiful but that’s as far as it goes. Paid extra for room upgrade and grand lounge package but now ON OUR ANNIVERSARY some privacy would be good but we have two people fixing aircon in our room , no privacy, can’t even get changed , go to toilet or have shower. Very bad service especially paying 800$ AUD I am not happy and hope our experience gets better and we can use our room after lunch???"
4,"Stunning location with excellent facilities.  Most important was the interaction of the staff, so humble, caring and loved the endless smiles all round.  The grounds were just amazing and kept so tidy, along with the pool for its sheer size.  We dinned at all the restaurants, but to be honest could come up a notch to match the hotels rating being a 5 star resort. Would have given our review a 5 star rating if the food was at that level. I am only talking about the dinner time service, as the breakfast selections were great.   Would I recommend this hotel, and would we go back my answer is a definite YES!  Must thank the hotel so much for the birthday celebration that they put on for my wife....it was a standout along with a complimentary bottle of champagne.  As part of a luxury…"

5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali is a great place to spend a few days in Bali, it is very conveniently located near the airport in a beautiful exclusive setting.  The staff is very accommodating and know how to take care of their guests.  The facility is showing its age but it is very well maintained and kept clean."
5,Amazing place for families with lots of fish and ducks and geese .. very friendly staff at the club lounge (which is at an additional charge) but we spent every morning and evening there and was totally worth it! And the club is very generous too and accommodating!   Absolutely recommended! Thank u for a comfortable stay.   Would recommend the hotel to opt for rooms ONLY renovations. Everything else is gorgeous including location beach .. I think main and public areas have been recently done And at great quality   Just lovely!
4,"We have only been back from our holiday a week and we keep talking about it and how much we would go back. We were 2 adults and 4 yo child, flying from Perth and using a Luxury escape deal for 8N, it was just what we needed and hassle free. Quick flights, 30 min drive from airport. All staff at this place are amazing and service brilliant.  Agree with other comments that the rooms are a little dated but we were fine with it, it was clean and comfortable. Our room had sofa bed couch on floor for child. It just meant we sat on balcony at night when he slept, but looking over lagoon that was rather nice.  Restaurants great, food really good, Bali dancing meal was the best night. Salsa bar for cocktails the best place.  The best part of the trip was using the pools, the waterslide…"
4,"It’s a huge hotel, and you need to walk quite a bit from one location to the other. Hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is surrounded with green, and a sand beach is just at the end of the hotel. Swimming pools are great and I like the jogging track close to the beach as well. Three restaurants are available for BF, but you should try to avoid the early morning BF in the restaurant next to the beach, it was full of noisy crowds. The only complaint is that My next door was a noisy group who like to bang the door and sing during the midnight."
5,"Everything was first rate, all staff very friendly and had great talks with staff. Would have loved to stay another week. Room was great and the food was great 👍 . Staff had many years of experience and were very welcoming 😁🙏"

5,"Visited Grand Hyatt Bali with my family and stayed almost two weeks at the resort. We really loved the hotel, the rooms were spacious and close to the pools and beach. All the gardens and water features were always immaculate and extremely well maintained. The pools were fun and I highly recommend the hidden Balinese feature pool for adults trying to escape the small kids (no offense intended). The food in all restaurants was excellent but we also enjoyed a few dinners at the shopping center immediately outside the hotel. We also enjoyed talking to the staff who were always smiling and bent over backwards to help in anyway they could.  I really am struggling to find a fault, however one or two spots in the swimming pools could use some maintenance but other than that there…"
5,"We got a day pass today to access the pool and beach. Most amazing pool we have ever been at. Just incredible, the only criticism I have is the cocktail. I ordered a pina colada, was lying out on the beach and it just arrived in a standard plastic glass. Was pretty disappointed as I thought the presentation could have been a lot better. I’ve been to cheaper places in sanur and their cocktails were out of this world.  Other then that highly recommend this place.  I have added 2 photos.. the first one is the cocktail at the Hyatt. The other is from a place in sanur I had as an example of what a pina colada could look like.. "
5,"Had initial reservations after reading the bad reviews but it was more than anything we could ask for. The room is clean, baby cot was prepared. Beach was clean, pool service was attentive . Staff were v friendly to our toddler who likes to run around . The proximity to the Bali collection meant we could go for lunch or coffee or I could have a quick shopping trip when baby was sleeping "
5,"Amazing property, beautiful garden and buildings, perfect location at the beach. Staff was very friendly and caring. We had a beautiful stay. The only thing I can say is that the beds need improvement. Mattress was not very comfortable, and we could hear furnish being moved around in the morning from the room upstairs. It disturbed our sleep. Still, I highly recommend this place..."
5,"Myself and my wife stayed here fro our honeymoon in August 2019. Its a spectacular property. From the moment you arrive at reception it exceeded our expectations.  All the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel resort itself is great with several restaurant choices for lunch and dinner, all offering a wide selection of food.  If you are visiting Bali I would 100% recommend you go and stay here. We defintely will be back "

5,"We have just returned home from 10 amazing nights at The Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua.  Having stayed in many Resorts throughout Bali over the years I would have to rate this as the number one.   What a stunning property, the design of the lagoon pool is fantastic as is the water slide providing hours of entertainment for both children and adults. The rooms are modern, clean and very generous in size.  Interconnecting rooms was perfect for our family of five with each room in addition to either a king size or two doubles having a large day bed doubling as a third bed.  Our only hesitation in staying here again is the hefty price of the kids club. Our three boys absolutely loved it and we would happily of allowed them to go every day if it weren't for the $30 per hour it cost us to…"
5,"We stayed in Grand Hyatt for 8 nights in the beginning of July with our 2 children age 6 and 9.  The hotel is not as modern as some new hotels in Bali, but we loved the atmosphere.  It is surrounded with trees, there are covered walkways, and lots of space. There were plenty of people, but it didn’t feel like that at all. Just make sure you book the restaurant at least a day in advance. The beach is right next to the resort and if you walked a bit further north there was a lovely place to go snorkeling. Our children loved it and so did we. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.  We had a ‘luxury escapes’ deal that included breakfast and dinner. We loved our stay and we would certainly come back if we’re ever in Bali again."
4,Checking in was a bit slow at the beginning because a lot of people but the staffs were very friendly and helpful. Overall we loved the place and their service. The view from the room is definitely one of the highlight of the place.

4," 342/5000 This is my second visit to the Hyatt hotel. First time alone and second with family. Despite the minor improvement in the bathroom. But the hotel has given a special impression to my daughter, starting from the less hetic check-in process, friendly service at the club lounge, charming beaches and relaxed hotel atmosphere."
5,"I have been staying at the Grand Hyatt since more than 26 years. The hotel has never stopped improving. The staff is extremely helpful, caring and genuine. The food is amazing. The attention to details will blow you away. Warm credits to the outstanding staff and management."
2,"The Grand Hyatt Bali has some incredible grounds and a fantastic beach.  The focus for this property is clearly on these items.  Where the property lacks focus in on the outdated rooms - ours also held a musty, mold-like smell for the duration of our stay.  Simply put, I just expect more out of the Hyatt brand.  For these reasons I would neither recommend this resort nor return unless the rooms received some well needed renovation."
5,We were really impressed by the beautifully maintained hotel grounds and Nusa Dua beach. Would also highly recommend Pasar Senggol experience (local buffet & tradicional dances) as it was certainly worth the price.

You are treated very special, the staff are friendly,, both the beach and pool superb, the food tasty++ and the Grand Club is in a league of its own. All the staff were eager to please and nothing too much effort. This resort is a jewel in Bali."
5,"This was our first time visiting Bali. We had a luxury escapes deal and we were blown away with the resort. The grounds were amazing, staff very helpful and friendly.  We all loved the swimming pools and the slide. Great position too, opposite Bali collection.  We had the best time relaxing at grand Hyatt and can’t wait to return. Breakfast was great as were the lunches and dinners  Absolute paradise"
2,"I would not recommend staying at the Grand Hyatt Bali. The quality of our stay was inconsistent and disappointing in a number of ways. While the hotel lobby, grounds and spa are very beautiful, there wasn't much else that my partner and I liked about the Grand Hyatt.   We booked an ocean view room with a king bed. We were disappointed to find that our room had twin beds and minimal ocean view. Our room mainly faced a garden area. There was a small section of ocean view but only if you were sitting in one corner of the balcony. The hotel resolved the twin bed issue by putting a zipper on the bed but we did not get the ocean view we were expecting. To make things worse, our room looked like it had seen better days...about twenty years ago. All of the furniture was chipped, the…"
5,"Very big and nice room for 3 adults close to the Grand Club . This club was one of the best i have been so far in SE Asia (better than HR Hua Hin, HR Phuket, HR KK, GH KL, GH Singapore, HR Yogya, HR Samur Bali) . Staff were excellent (guess most of them have been working already long time in this club), service was outstanding, the food was excellent for a club!  Club breakfast was the best club breakfast experienced in any club so far . Really an example !   Of course there are some minor points like plastic chairs on the beach, the swimming pool was overcrowded , too much noise in the club swimming pool, but anyway, the beach was very nice and you could swim in the sea  . With some minor improvements, this hotel should go up to category 3 or 4 .  Price quality = excellent if…"
5,"Beautiful grounds - took me a couple of days to navigate around the resort with out a map.  While the pool area had the typical hustle-bustle in getting a good lounge, the beach lounges were very spaced out and always available - most under gorgeous trees.  Staff absolutely fabulous and after a couple of days we realised we didn’t need to buy extra bottled water as the house keepers generously left ample supplies.  We had the luxury escape package and although we have yet to do the maths to see if it was really worth it, we are glad we did as there were many luxury items that we normally wouldn’t justify buying (eg champagne brunch).  We also preferred not having the hassle of heading out of the resort for dinner each night.  It was a pity that guests had to pay for things that…"
5,"Bali is an excellent holiday destination: it has it all; but staying at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua is the icing on the holiday. Everything is just 5 * magic.

5,"We chose to stay here because of a deal from luxury escapes. it was a 5 star resort, with 5 star service. Great for families. We had vouchers for dinners and some cocktails which were fantastic. The Salsa Verda resturant for dinner and breakfast a favourite. The surprise was the 21% addition to all the bills. this made it pricey, but you have the discovery mall and local shops nearby to chose from. About 25minute drive from Kuta and Legion, but worth it for the beauty of the place. Highly recommend "
5,Our whole experience at grand Hyatt was superb. The amenities were great and the staff were warm and welcoming. The club access was great value for money. And provided a resort within a resort.  Will Definitely stay here again.  
5,"We stayed here for our family holiday, and what a place. It was absolutely fantastic.  One of the best holidays we have had. The hotel itself was huge, it had a kids club, a few shops, souvenir shops, restaurants and an evening market. People selling souvenirs at the market every evening.   We stayed in an interconnecting grand room and they were def grand. Nice, big spacious rooms with a nice view of the ponds. We weren’t too far from the shops and the beach. The main pool was big with lots of sun Edda round although some people would take them from morning and then be away from the pools. But we always managed to get at least 1 or 2 sun beds. The pools were nice and clean, very big and it was lovely to have a choice of pools. The water slides were a big hit with the kids and…"
5,"I left after three nights feeling completely at peace. Not a single complaint! Travelled with my three year old and she loved it! From the awesome kiddies slide, to the cycle along the beach... we really couldn’t get enough. The restaurants cater for everyone. We took the club access... I didn’t think this was worthwhile for us. We would rather have three full meals as they are well priced. As opposed to Atlantis in Dubai where the club room has more substantial food items throughout the day, this club access has a “happy hour” 5-7pm where you can find a reasonable snack. But the advantage of check in and check out times, and the exceptional service at the club access would make me want to book this again. We really have no complaints. Special thanks to the gentleman who…"
5,"Nice property with lovely landscaping, ponds etc.. 5 mins walk from the shopping arcade. Courteous Staff and great food. Spacious rooms with day bed for kids snuck in a bay window kind of space. My son loved it."

3,"good place to stay, but may need to renovate the rooms. the septic tank also need to be frequently checked. last stay on 3137 the smell of poop was terrible inside the room due to septic tank problems."
5,"Stayed 4 nights in August 2019 in the Grand Club King Room. Our check in took place in the Grand Club lounge section of the hotel. As a Hyatt member, we were upgraded to a Deluxe King room. The room  decor was simple but the King size  bed (8 ft. Wide) and bathroom were huge! Room location was great! Our balcony faced a beautiful pond and we were just a few minutes walk to the club pool and the beach. Daily breakfast and canapés were provided at the club lounge. Food quality and selection were good, better than expected. All the staff that we encountered at the hotel were friendly, attentive and helpful. Overall an excellent stay!"
3,"Whilst this resorts location is amazing, the resort itself requires a lot of work. We had to be moved rooms due to plumbing issues and the air conditioner unit rusting out. Some of the feature rock around the pools had broken off thus exposing steel reinforcing mesh, one of the pools had a terrible smell coming from the drain. "
4,We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua with our 2 young children and another family. The pool was beautiful and the kids LOVED the water slide. Most of the staff were friendly and attentive. Great location with close proximity to the Bali Collection. Kids spent 2 days in the kids club and loved it. Complimentary WIFI was also great.
3,"We were 10 in our group and spent a week at this resort.  Initial impression was great, wide expanse, huge resort, strong security.  We had 5 rooms and wanted them close by, on arrival, the bags were sorted efficiently and check in took around 20 mins (a slow process), however, we got the rooms we wanted.  We had the standard king sized rooms on the ground floor….large room with a recessed sofa bed. The rooms were dated and in serious need of both a make over and an upgrade…..the entire property is in a desperate need of investment especially the rooms….doors that barely close, broken shower that needed fixing, lizard that needed clearing out….that said, plenty of charging points….travel adapters not needed. We had drinks in the main bar off the lobby…wide selection, nice…"

4,"The staff were wonderful at this property, and we very much enjoyed our stay. The only hiccup, was upon arrival, we got into bed our first night and found a large amount of sand already in the sheets - which made us feel they had not been changed since the previous guest. While housekeeping did come and change the sheets - it took a really long time, and there was zero apology for the stall sandcastle we found in the bed on arrival.  The property had lovely pools, wonderful beach access, and was otherwise a real pleasure."
5,"We are currently staying here and feel we chose the perfect hotel for our 2 week holiday. Everyone who works here appear to be so happy to come to work each morning. It makes a huge difference to be treated with a gorgeous smile every day.   The hotel is constantly being cleaned by staff, whether it’s sweeping the forever falling leaves from the trees, or the pool area being washed.   Great location and good access to the towns further north.   However, what I am finding frustrating, is that around the pool areas, the beds are being reserved before people are going for breakfast! So by 10am there are no free beds, with any shade/umbrella. We have been forced to sit on the beach, which don’t get me wrong, is stunning, but even the beds on the beach fill up very quickly too. We…"
3,"The outside gardena and views are beautiful. We got a good deal on luxury escapes so decided to try this resort.  We have been to Westin 3 times as we love it there, but found Grand Hyatt couldn't match their level of service. We felt ripped off with kids club....I was given receipts of the price everyday and then got charged an extra $500 Australian $$ at the end because of tax and service charges......Kids club is free at westin  and actually better, so was very annoyed about that .   ...the buffet breakfast can't compete with westin and sofitel and I'm sure other resorts.. The variety was not on that level. My husband was most disappointed. And the stray cats need to be removed, we don't mind the squirrels....And Iv never seen a monitor lizard before but saw so many here,…"
1,"We made a booking for 12 rooms, three months in advance. We paid for Grand Rooms with Ocean View. We sent them copies of our passports to confirm our ages and families. We informed them that we are traveling with senior citizens and handicapped members of the family. We were given standard rooms with twin beds for all married couples in the worst section of the hotel in the remotest corner of the hotel which made it impossible for our octogenarian mother to go anywhere. The rooms were stinking. The allotted rooms were 10 to 15 rooms away from each other in the resort. My room number was 4134 and the room allotted to my children was 4114. The front office manager Ardalita Sovyan was rude and obnoxious and said in a rude tone  “ We are fully booked. Do whatever you have to, there…"
4,"Stayed 5 nights at grand hyatt. Going back to Bali in 7 months again but we are not considering going back to Grand Hyatt though :(   Entry to the Lobby/check in .. you are treated like a king. View straight away has such a wow effect. The musicians in the Lobby playing beautiful music!Just lovely  Rooms nice and spacious. We stayed in a superior room (the standard one) with 2 kids in the South village which was perfect as we were in between the breakfast restaurant and the pool, so was not far to walk. Some other hotel building would require longer walking. With kids might get bit tiring forgetting things in the room, changing them..  Big hotel, very clean, top beach (even though sea very rough in July) with sunbeds under trees.. lots of squirrels, very cute. The resort.. wow,…"

5,Fabulous 10 day stay. This place has everything you need and also a very good shopping centre opposite so no need to go to the busy downtown areas. Excellent restaurant choices did not dissapoint. Wonderfully manicured grounds remind you that you are in a tropical paradise.
5,Fabulous hotel in amazing grounds. Stayed 13 nights and couldn’t fault anything. Stayed with husband and 12yr old. Bali collection centre nearby was excellent for food. We had a club room so had unlimited non alcoholic drinks all day in the club room and alcoholic drinks 5-7pm with snacks. The good available was actually enough for a meal
5,"We stayed in Grand Hyatt Bali from 30 July to 11 August 2019. This was our third stay in that hotel in the last three years. For us there is no other choice in Nusa Dua than this hotel. There are so may things to be mentioned, but the key ones include perfect location of the hotel, cleanliness and good size of the rooms, friendliness of the staff, the pools and overall layout of the hotel's premises, dining options, shops etc. I highly recommend this hotel for the families and couples as a piece of paradise on the Earth. We will definitely come back again."
5,"Our family just visited Bali - we stayed at Grand Hyatt, amazing property, facilities and Chefs at Garden Court and Salsa verde went out of the way to accommodate our dietary requirements.  Had a relaxing stay with them."
5,Amazing swimming pools the one with the water slide provides hours of entertainment for children aged 5-12. Plenty of restaurants to choose from within the hotel. The Japanese was amazing. Very close to Bali collection for so many options for meals and you can walk. Shame not many family room options to choose from at this hotel.

5,"We spent 05 great days here. It was our first time in Bali and we loved our stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali. Yes the hotel food and drink was expensive but if you venture out there are really cheap options. The hotel pools were great and the beach was always empty, so there was plenty of space. The room was fairly new and comfortable. We would definately recommend hiring a driver for the day to see the island. there are plenty of drivers plying their trade out side the hotel grounds. The hotel staff were friendly and polite and they always had time to say hello and make you feel welcome."
4,"Beautiful hotel. Great location across from Bali collection and on the beach. Some spas don’t work. Pool area spectacular. Staff friendly and helpful. Biggest disappointment was the Price of food and drink, expensive in all hotels visited in nusa. More than perth prices. $60 for 3 course lunch off kids menu 😤 "
5,"Our family are lucky to have access the the Grand Club by staying at the Club Room at this hotel.  Highly recommended.  My review is focusing on the Club area but I wanted to note that the word I have for the landscape of this hotel is ""paradise"" ""heavenly""  ""Stunning""  The room is ready for some refresh which I was told is happening soon.  We are family of 4 and we look forward to the Grand Club every morning and evening.  Even when we are out touring Bali, we look at our watch and looking forward to  go back to our paradise and visit our friends at the Grand Club.  Everyone work works here is top notch and what a 5 star staff should be.  My wife is so happy that they knows her favorite fruit is mango and papaya and they always have a plate or 2 prepare just for her.  We just…"

Just one thing need a cart help to drop and pick from Rooms or around the property lot of walking around."

Everyone in the hotel is so friendly and helpful and everywhere we went, we were welcomed with a warm smile. The facilities are great and everything is so well maintained.

5,"After a few days in Kuta, Nusa Dua was the perfect getaway for the family. Great family time by the pool slide which our kids couldn't get enough of. The grounds are nice too with a nice walk around by the beach. It's location is close by the Bali collection which has some decent shops and restaurants. The food at the hotel was only OK, bit they get 5 stars for the property alone! Also the suite upgrade which was much appreciated!"
5,In our oppinion the Grand Hyatt Bali is one of most beautiful hotels in the World. We‘d like to thank the staff for making us feel at home away from home. A special thanks goes to the team of the Grand Club. You made our stay magical and unforgetable.
5,"We had a fabulous family holiday with a Luxury Escapes package for 8 nights.  Definitely worthwhile getting a Lagoon Room on the ground floor, especially with kids.  We had room 1109 which was close to the pool, restaurants and beach which was an advantage as the hotel is massive!  Great restaurants, the spa is amazing, and the kids had a ball on the waterslide everyday."
4,"Rooms a little dated, musky smell in rooms not nice. Grounds lovely, staff polite and more than helpful, day spa very nice although expensive. Overall we had a great stay, kids loved it, walking distance to Bali collection which is handy."
2,"We stayed here from July 31st-Aug 7th, 2019, and previously stayed in 2017 and 2015. Here are the pros and cons from our visit:  (+) -pools/water slide -rooms -beach -grounds -Japanese Restaurant is fantastic - Friendly staff - Family friendly  (-) - One of the heaters to the jacuzzi broke prior to our arrival and remained broken throughout our stay (in the middle of high season)! This resulted in the temperature being at least 5-7 degrees cooler (Celsius) than the advertised temperature of 35 — which is where it was during our previous two visits. Needless to say, the jacuzzi was a large selling point for us and we were very disappointed the matter was not addressed during our stay despite repeated discussions with the staff and duty manager.  - Bed sheets and pool/beach towels…"
5,"After a few days in Kuta, Nusa Dua was the perfect getaway for the family. Great family time by the pool slide which our kids couldn't get enough of. The grounds are nice too with a nice walk around by the beach. It's location is close by the Bali collection which has some decent shops and restaurants. The food at the hotel was only OK, bit they get 5 stars for the property alone! Also the suite upgrade which was much appreciated!"
5,In our oppinion the Grand Hyatt Bali is one of most beautiful hotels in the World. We‘d like to thank the staff for making us feel at home away from home. A special thanks goes to the team of the Grand Club. You made our stay magical and unforgetable.
5,"We had a fabulous family holiday with a Luxury Escapes package for 8 nights.  Definitely worthwhile getting a Lagoon Room on the ground floor, especially with kids.  We had room 1109 which was close to the pool, restaurants and beach which was an advantage as the hotel is massive!  Great restaurants, the spa is amazing, and the kids had a ball on the waterslide everyday."
4,"Rooms a little dated, musky smell in rooms not nice. Grounds lovely, staff polite and more than helpful, day spa very nice although expensive. Overall we had a great stay, kids loved it, walking distance to Bali collection which is handy."
2,"We stayed here from July 31st-Aug 7th, 2019, and previously stayed in 2017 and 2015.

5,"We went with 2 adults and 2 kids aged 4 and 9. Reception area is great, check-in and out went smooth.  Rooms are good, but towels and free water was a bit random :). Sometimes we had 5 water, some days 3 and same with towels. Most days we had 3 towels.  The grounds are fantastic and right at the beach. Very clean always.  Only downside for us was that food and drinks were pretty expensive / based on the room price you get some expectations for the restaurant prices and we didnt feel they were a match. It is not really a problem since there are a lot of other options in the area - both at bali collection and at the beach.    But overall it is fantastic hotel, great grounds, service, location - highly recommended.   "
5,"As always The Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua Bali, does not disappoint. A beautiful and majestic outlook draws you in as you enter the complex, accompanied by the cultural tradition of ""ringing the gong"". Everything about this hotel is restful and luxurious, yet still quite affordable, and the complex has retained its original colonial architecture. "
5,"Everyday I think about our recent holiday at The Grand Hyatt in Bali. My whole family misses the place and the people so much! We stayed at the hotel in the beginning of July for 7 nights and we booked a Club room (highly recommended). Pandu checked us in and gave us all the details that we needed to know. The welcome drink was delicious!  The Club benefits are worth the extra pay because it includes breakfast at the Club lounge (not crowded in comparison to the other restaurant), access to the private pool and cocktails from 5-7 pm which included unlimited drinks and a delicious spread of food. The lounge was so peaceful and relaxing because it was surrounded by a pond with beautiful Koi fish. The Club Manager, Urip made sure to look after us throughout our stay. Sutrisna was…"
3,Travelled here in July with family and friends and stayed 10 nights on a luxury escapes deal.  This is the first time a luxury escapes has not exceeded my expectations. We were also short changed some vouchers. Our friends spent an hour arguing for theirs which they received but I couldn’t be bothered.   We requested in advance not to be in the west wing as it’s so far and also to be near friends and got neither. The initial rooms (2 x interconnecting) we were given were literally the last rooms in the resort just before Bali collection and not very nice. When paying a lot of money for a hotel all rooms should be nice. After an hour conversation at reception after a very long day of travel with toddlers we were told we could move the next day which we did.  All rooms are…
4,"We had a beautiful stay at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua.  Only thing missing here I thought was a swim up pool bar and some good afternoon poolside music.  The roof top bar also could have had a better vibe with the addition of an afternoon musician or good tunes, it lacked a bit of atmosphere for afternoon drinks.  A beach event would also have been great.  Most other Nusa Dua Resorts hold things beach or pool side however this does not happen at Grand Hyatt.  Very conveniently located across the road from Bali Collection.  Room was a brilliant size albeit the bed was a tad hard and the pillows were not that comfortable.  The waterslide and pool coupled with the beach was a fabulous waterplay ground for the kids, lots of families were staying.  Great gym facilities and the Spa was…"

5,"From the moment we walked into the breathtaking lobby to the moment we had to leave, we thoroughly enjoyed every minute in between. Our room was amazing and if you can afford the additional to upgrade to a Grand Executive Room, I would absolutely recommend it. The staff were always amazing and nothing was too much trouble for them. We loved the selections of pools and tried them all. The beach is magnificent and very clean and perfect for singles. couples or families. We had a fantastic Teppanyaki dinner and their beautiful Japanese restaurant (Nampu) and would recommend this to anyone. My family and I have been to Bali several times but Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua is our favourite hands down. You are guaranteed a lovely experience here."
4,"The sanitised Nusa Dua is rather different than the bohemian settings of Ubud. Having said that, if you want to restrict yourself to the resort and the beach, then this property is as good as it gets. The shopping arcade outside the hotel is a good place to buy local knick knacks."
3,"We booked our last holiday week of 3 in the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua (8 days). The entrance is overwhelming, beautiful and impressive. On the check-in you notice immediately the difference between the warm, personal welcome at many other places in Bali and this global multinational practical giant working with staff under pressure. It is a giant complex, with over 600 rooms and that’s unavoidable in this enormous factory.  The connected rooms we had had a continuous smell of molt. After 24 hours of nonstop airco this seemed to be gone. Unfortunately the many chinese in the connecting buildings made so much noise that we had to close the balcony door too often. The rooms and buildings are very noisy, and when you are unlucky you enjoy your neighbours continuously. A nice giant…"
5,The Reception and service was very good experience in Grand Hyatt Bali . The location is very nice at Nusa Dua Beach. I recommend anybody visiting Bali to prefer this place. Evening stalls and local performance will make you cool. 
4,"We stayed in Hyatt for 13 days. I liked the time I spent here, you can find lots of activities!!! From surfing to golf, from volleyball to mini-football!  I also want to notice that breakfasts are very delicious!!!  All the personal was very kind and sensitive to us !!!  But the only reason I put 4 stars that Wi-Fi in our room was bad! We lived in room 1305 and Wi-Fi suddenly disconnected a lot of times so I couldn’t talk on my phone normally and watch videos on YouTube!!! Please fix your Wi-Fi, because everything was cool except Wi-Fi!!! "

4,"situated on the perfect beach of Nusa Dua, great service all round with excellent facilities suitable for all types of holidays, we stayed as friends and loved the location.  We did find the hotel (the room we had was a Grand room) getting a little dated with maintenance lacking."
4,Its second time this year for us.  We loved it so much in January - kids love the slides and interesting pools.  July not particularly great for me as the weather was not as warm as January so did not get a chance to enjoy the 11am - aqua aerobics class. Overall always fun.   In the lounge area - Sri was excellent - she made us feel welcome every time we dined there. Nice to be remembered by the staff - feel welcoming!
4,"This hotel was chosen for us as part of a family wedding.  It was our first time to Bali from the US and, while we enjoyed it very much, I'm not sure it's right for everyone.    Pros:  The property is beautiful and the staff could not be nicer.  The restaurants are fine though no Balinese food available.  It's across the street from a ""mall"" - an outdoor shopping center with lots of restaurants (a great Indian one, btw), clothing stores, souvenirs, etc.  The property is located on a very long stretch of beach which is nice to walk.  The rooms are very comfortable - we had a suite - though with 600+ rooms, many don't have views and are quite a hike.    Cons:  Lots and lots of kids.  This is NOT a honeymoon spot.  The gym does not have AC so it's like working out in a sauna.  They…"

Huge driveway and pathway to the reception desk, you can immediately feel and see the Balinese culture and architecture. The grounds, the gardens and landscape are impeccable and can surely attributes for a very relaxing stay.  Staff are very friendly, welcoming, polite and always smiling. Amazing and wonderful staff to create memorable stay.    Excellent facilities with several swimming pools and long stretch of private beach (no vendors around). Had a nice dinner at Garden Cafe, quality  classic cuisines from Asia to Europe and the service in this restaurant was superb.  The hotel is located near to Bali Collection, where you can find several shops and…"

5,"We visited last week and the service was excellent. Huge resort on the beach with lush foliage and gardens. Several large pools. Right on the beach so you can go from pools to the beach. The ocean water was very warm. Included buffet breakfast which was extensive and very good. There is a nightly Balinese dinner show which you should see and there is a huge dinner feast. Overall, recommended."
4,Had a lovely stay here after a luxury escapes deal.   Staff were incredible and food was very nice. Really liked the night show and meals. Room was great.  My only big comment would be the water bottles I used and I would like the hotel to develop a system to reduce plastic waste. I must have been using 5 bottles a day and I would like to see guests being charged for a aluminium bottle perhaps to reuse and have filter stations. Given the plastic on the beaches in most of Bali I would really like to see this change before I returned. Time for a rethink here.  Thanks to the amazing staff.
3,Resort   The resort is amazing. Attention to detail by ALL members of staff is amazing. Onsite gym is great along with the multiple pools offered. Plenty of sun beds available near the pool & on the beach (although on the beach the locals are attempting to sell merchandise & massages).   Food  Breakfast selection is excellent. There is no HALAL food onsite so it will need to be the veggie option if you are muslim although outside the resort there is a selection of over 200 restaurants which do cater to halal   Bedroom   The only gripe I had was the room. At first it looked big and spacious however the decor was dated. We also found 3 cockroaches within our room luckily we managed to get rid of one however the other two we could not locate so it left a sense of uneasy on the back…

5,Great places to stay for a family. Interconnecting rooms great set up for family of 5. Waterslide paid dividends!! No need to leave the resort if you don’t want to. Actually felt like I had a holiday. Great food.
5,"Right from check in to check out it’s been an amazing experience travelling with kids and family don’t think twice book Grand Hyatt Bali with ease the resort is huge with plenty to do we didn’t feel like going out  Make sure you are not in a hurry and book 4-5 nights minimum to enjoy your vacation  Kids will love the pool and activities at resort  Close to Bali collection mall plenty to shop , spa and daily need with easy access "
4,"Beautiful resort complex with multiple pools. Grand Hyatt club included a private pool for the club, less crowded and better sunbeds. Room was spacious and clean. Service at club breakfast and afternoon was a bit slow, but very friendly."
3,Stayed 3 nights. The Grandeur and opulence of the foyer was not consistent through to the rooms. First room we were placed in was way too far from all the amenities so we requested a change. Second room good location but dated and not as clean as I would have expected. Resort is well kept and gardens are lovely. Breakfast was average in my opinion have certainly had better. For our family resort way to spread out meaning a lot of walking and in the heat is not ideal nor how we would choose to spend a holiday. Not terrible but wouldnt come back...
5,"We had a wonderful 10 day stay at the Grand Hyatt in Bali, it is a beautiful resort by an expansive beach, the gardens and ponds are stunning. The pools weave through the resort so give you a more private setting wherever you are even though it is a big resort, and there is plenty of shade beneath umbrellas and frangipani trees, we used sun loungers mainly but if we went to the pool later in the day when it was busier it was just as nice laying on the lawn under the trees. The breakfast buffet, restaurants, service and staff were great too, all very friendly and helpful. They allocated us a new room without hesitation as our first room in the west village smelled of mould, I think it hadn’t been used in a while, maybe too as we had booked through a carrier not directly with the…"

5,I was stay in grand hyatt bali for 2 night to celebrate my gf birthday.. it was amazing n staff so friendly. Food in salsa verde was very good ! The hotel gived very beautiful flower to my gf in the afternoon n when we come back from our dinner again we got little surprise in the room . Thank to the Team 🙏🙏🙏 .
2,The Grand Hyatt is a great option for people that don’t mind expanding their waistline and cluttering their arteries. While delicious and healthy food is abundant on Bali it unfortunately hasn’t found its way to the Grand Hyatt. They however do charge 5-star prices making it even worse. 
4,"beautiful hotel with excellent service. We were upgraded to a suite with a living area, which was perfect with the kids. There was a nice basket of fruit and water awaiting us as well. The entertainment at the hotel bar was perfect for the evening. It was a guitar trio that played a lot of famous songs and sang very well.   The hotel has severals beautiful pools and slides for the kids. On the beach, close by the hotel, you can have a great 1 hour massage for US$10!"

I had my best massage ever there. - Wondering around seeing the wildlife in the gardens and ponds - The children loved all the pools - there are so many pool areas you could never get bored, always find a lounger and it never felt busy - The location - we walked out along to the beach to cafes, a park and across the road to the great Bali Collection shopping mall - probably the best hotel breakfasts we have ever eaten - so much choice! - Room was spacious and very comfy. The main bed was the biggest  I've ever seen, plus our son had another double size. - We really loved the pizza's in the Salsa Verde restaurant - The…"
4,We were here for three nights and while this place is not vegetarian friendly garden cafe was the best  of the best bet for vegan and vegetarian food.. they also cater people with allergies and food restrictions.. the breakfast had super wide range of options and our favorite was the Indian food .. I have lived in India for 25 years and then in US for last 10 years and this place had one of the most hospitable chef Ashish jakhmola and amazing amazing Indian food.. we  met the chef accidentally in the cafe and he invited us over for lunch made everything that we asked for.. grand Hyatt Bali you have a gem of a chef if we ever want to come again to Bali with family or host a family function this is the place we will be !! and thank you Chef Ashish Jakhmola my parents and even my 2…
5,"This place is fantastic, and the service was outstanding.  I don't remember we got this type of service at any other Hyatt.  I think the staff genuinely cared about the guest.  Location is excellent; lot's of food options."
5,"This hotel is stunning and perfectly located on the beach. It has beautiful pools, great restaurants and overall relaxing atmosphere. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We can't wait to come back."
3,This was our second visit to Bali in 3 years - with each visit we stayed in at least two hotels. Of the 4 hotels we stayed this was probably the most disappointing. We found the hotel to be very dated and could do with an uplift. However the biggest let down was the quality of the food. It felt very short on what is expected from a 5 star hotel. During one of our dining experiences a number of guests had to tell staff to re-cook the scrambled eggs as it was like a soup. The dishes prepared were not special. Further on most mornings there was often a 10-15+ minute wait to be seated for breakfast. Disappointing.

The main bed was the biggest  I've ever seen, plus our son had another double size. - We really loved the pizza's in the Salsa Verde restaurant - The…"
4,We were here for three nights and while this place is not vegetarian friendly garden cafe was the best  of the best bet for vegan and vegetarian food.. they also cater people with allergies and food restrictions.. the breakfast had super wide range of options and our favorite was the Indian food .. I have lived in India for 25 years and then in US for last 10 years and this place had one of the most hospitable chef Ashish jakhmola and amazing amazing Indian food.. we  met the chef accidentally in the cafe and he invited us over for lunch made everything that we asked for.. grand Hyatt Bali you have a gem of a chef if we ever want to come again to Bali with family or host a family function this is the place we will be !! and thank you Chef Ashish Jakhmola my parents and even my 2…
5,"This place is fantastic, and the service was outstanding.  I don't remember we got this type of service at any other Hyatt.  I think the staff genuinely cared about the guest.  Location is excellent; lot's of food options."
5,"This hotel is stunning and perfectly located on the beach. It has beautiful pools, great restaurants and overall relaxing atmosphere. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We can't wait to come back."
3,This was our second visit to Bali in 3 years - with each visit we stayed in at least two hotels. Of the 4 hotels we stayed this was probably the most disappointing. We found the hotel to be very dated and could do with an uplift. However the biggest let down was the quality of the food. It felt very short on what is expected from a 5 star hotel. During one of our dining experiences a number of guests had to tell staff to re-cook the scrambled eggs as it was like a soup. The dishes prepared were not special. Further on most mornings there was often a 10-15+ minute wait to be seated for breakfast. Disappointing.
5,"Our favourite hotel We come here every year and will continue to do so. Beautiful property, amazing staff, food, facilities, experience. Every time we visit here we always start palming our return visit  Highly recommend to all!"
5,"We had our anniversary celebration and the staff could not have been more accommodating.  we were upgraded to a suite and on our first evening they did a happy anniversary greeting on our bed with flowers.  The bedding was outstanding and we had to look up the bed size on the internet to figure out what it was as it was huge (Emperor Size - 7"" x 7"").  We had Club access and had outstanding breakfasts and cocktails & appetizers in the evening along with a private club pool.  Beach was clean and large with no problems in getting lounges.  Service was attentive and you felt that they really cared.  We will definitely be back."
5,"Perfect place for a family holiday. Everybody in the staff was very courteous and helpful. Service was excellent be it on the beach, the restaurants or in the rooms ( always served with a smile) Loads of things to do-  starting from the pools,beach, water activities etc.  Our kids wanted to do water surfing, unfortunately due to the low tide they were unable to do it properly and for the time that the activity was booked. The service provider, from the hotel, on their own, were nice enough to cancel the charges, since they were not able to provide the service properly due to low tide.  All the restaurants provided excellent food. The service was unobtrusive and present all the time.  "
5,"Grand Hyatt Bali gives you everything you need on a trip to Bali, and more.  All the conveniences and choices of a large, well oiiled hotel but with the personal service of a small intimate establishment  where you are made to feel 'extra special'. With their expansive areas of gardens and beautiful beachfront, it is easy to discover many secluded spots to enjoy  (if you need) even at their peak season.  Their Japanese restaurant Nampu is a must-try - even if the teppanyaki rooms are booked out, the a la carte menu in the rustic dining room offers delicious options  Highly recommend booking Grand CLub rooms - the lounge facilities are amazing as are the the service and complimentary extras that come with this category of accommodation.   "
5,"A wonderful place for a relaxing holiday. Luxurious rooms, super friendly and helpful staff, fabulous restaurants, beautiful pool and beach areas and the most amazing day spa! Have fun with the water aerobics and don't miss the Teppanyaki. A touch of Balinese paradise 💕"

5,"Thank you to your wonderful staff for making our family vacation so wonderful. We loved the kids club staff, the pool was stunning, and the location was perfect to visit the market, it's just across the street! Also a quick taxi ride into the city to visit malls, water park etc."
5,So relaxing and the staff gave such wonderful service. It was more than expected and everything we wanted for a relaxing and rejuvenating holiday. Would highly recommend this holiday for anyone looking for some time out.
1,Hotel grounds and pool were absolutely fantastic. The quality of the food offered at the Garden Cafe was well below our expectations for a Hyatt Hotel.  We will certainly be going back. Loved the 8 days we stayed there!!
5,"We stayed three nights in the South Village which is great as it's nearer to the beach. We were initially given a room in the West Village but asked to change and the hotel kindly obliged.   The stay was great. The hotel has a beautiful and clean private beach. It is a short walk to Bali Collection - a ""village"" of restaurants, shops and even a supermarket - so it's convenient for when you don't want to dine in-house. Otherwise, there's a few shops and quite a number of restaurants within the hotel too.   We were at the first floor and loved it. Our terrace overlooks a pond with ducks every morning. We can see the sea too. While the room is not spanking new, it's comfortable.   Room service is a bit of a hit-and-miss depending on the food you order. Love dishes tend to be bland…"
5,Well situated with a good beach and great facilities. Shopping Centre an easy walk . Great staff. Yes the rooms are a bit dated but clean and had everything you could need. Ours faced the Garden Restaurant so had the noise of the extractor fans which was a bit annoying. Breakfast was just great and its a place we would go back to.

5,"We had an amazing experience staying at Grand Hyatt! The ambience, staff, views, all make up for a memorable and satisfying experiences. We were 2 families and had the best time enjoying its facilities. in addition, we are vegetarians with further dietary restrictions. Luckily, every day, Chef Ashish, Lia and her team made it exceptionally easy for us to have food. If you are a vegetarian and have Jain food dietary restrictions, this is the hotel to stay, where i highly recommend Chef Ashish's culinary skills. The room we had was nicely positioned between the lobby and various pools, and nusa dua beach.  Overall, we had a great time at Grand Hyatt! I would absolutely go again and would recommend it to everyone! Many thanks to entire team at Grand Hyatt!"
3,"Its always disappointing when expectation is not matched by reality. As you approach this hotel you are immediately impressed by the secure entry, the sweeping drive though beautiful gardens to a spacious inviting lobby. They ring the gong on your entrance. Then you are told your room isn't ready even though its after check in time. 40 minutes later you reach a dated but functional quiet garden facing room. This is a huge hotel and its busy. So busy the 3 restaurants (4 if you count the breakfast area) don't really cope. We were there on a package via Luxury Escapes and when we used their vouchers things were OK....but venture outside these arrangements and look out! i.e. 1 hamburger, 1 steak sandwich and 2 beers = $A65! After a few days the lack of variety and the subsequent…"
4,"The first room we were taken to was old and smelled very musty .I think the culprit was the bamboo blinds and the fabric on the old daybed. It was also a long walk to the lobby and other facilities. The next morning we asked to change to another room, this was not much better so we declined and asked for another. They took us to the North wing and the room had been renovated. This room was much better. It was also very close to the Lobby, the Garden Cafe for breakfast and the balinese pool. The resort itself has over 600 rooms and four wings North, South East and West. Not good for people with disabilities as can involve a lot of walking, easy to get lost and hard to navigate your way around. We couldn't find our first room very easily. The grounds are beautifully landscaped…"
5,"Just like coming home.  The staff at he Grand Hyatt Bali are just fantastic.  The children love the hotel as it offers so much for them to do.  The beach is great, the pool is amazing.  The perfect place to spend your last couple of days before heading home.  The access to the hotel make it ideal for late checkout and easy late night trip home."
3,We stayed at Grand Hyatt for 3 days from 2July. On arrival the grounds look amazing. Our room was not ready at 3.00pm and waited for 1 hour.   It looks like we were given run of mill house room rather than deluxe room we booked. Bathroom was looking very tired with bath tub old. Clock not working.  Postive Lovely beach and never busy. Good breakfast  Lovely staff too  Negative The pool & jacuizz areas got too crowded with kids. They need to consider an adult only pool or have someone monitor the jacuizz as parents totally ignored signs.   There was two big corporate party and many of the restaurants were busy. Overall resort felt full and busy but if you moved to beach area it was much nicer.

5,The Grand Hyatt is in a great location right across the road from Bali Collection. The room and bathroom was spacious and the Grand Club facilities were nice. Check in was smooth - many thanks to Dhany.
1,"The grounds and positioning of the Hyatt was great but the rooms were run down and tired – definitely not fit for a five star accommodation. For example, the bathroom (bath/shower/basin) water in our first room came out of all the cold taps a dirty brown colour. The experience of the room being changed process was most unacceptable. For example, the Manager didn't even come to the new room with us and passed this role to a staff member who had limited English. The second room we were shown was substandard and at that point we asked to speak to the General Manager. After waiting unattended for nearly an hour at the reception (missing our evening meal reservation) the Assistant General Manager (AGM) appeared saying the General Manager was too busy. The AGM  then proceeded with…"
5,"Had an amazing holiday with family travelling from UK and Australia.  Hotel was beautiful.  Pool bar staff were amazing, nothing was ever too much trouble.  Breakfast was gorgeous, rooms were huge, shower & bath great.  No complaints, would definitely love to return."
4,"This was our first trip to bali and we did it in style. This vast and beautiful resort was great for our family of four. We had a suite which was big, beautiful and had amazing ocean views. The grounds are impeccably kept and every where you look there is something interesting to look at. The staff at all the restaurants were friendly and accommodating.The waterslide entertained our two active sons for hours which was a good thing as there is an additional and expensive charge for the Kids' Club at the Hyatt that I didn't appreciate so we didn't use it. This is generally my only criticism. The cultural shows each night were just wonderful. The direct beach access and beautiful breezes make the resort such a pleasure. There are other reviews that make a great deal about renos…"
5,"This is my first time in Bali and what a great way to start a holiday with a superb accommodation! I was sceptical at the start to come to Bali as I've heard a lot of bad things about it. But my experience proves me wrong... staying at the Grand Hyatt Bali is perfect for me. The resort is huge and have lots of amenities, close to the beach and shopping centres. Daily breakfast is scrumptious and I'm happy just chill and stay at the resort all week! So many things to do and the pool and beach is a must! I will definitely come back at stay at the Grand Hyatt in Bali."

1,"We stayed here for 5 nights and on the whole the place was brilliant, but, one big problem let it down....   I kept waking in the night hearing strange noises. One night I got up and spotted a mouse in the room which then quickly ran away and into a void the ceiling. I had a look and spotted that the mice hand made holes behind the spotlights to get in the room. This was quite concerning due to hygiene concerns with food being out etc. I'd also had lots of disturbed nights sleep.  The management at the hotel said they would get pest control out to have a look while we were out, but it turns out all they did was spra something - they did not attempt to block to the holes where the mice were getting in. We were offered a free meal, which was not satisfactory in my opinion.  This a…"
5,"My wife and spent 15 nights at the Grand Hyatt Bali in a great room overlooking the ocean with Grand Club access. Room was great, service was great, grounds are immaculate. 3rd year in a row and already planning #4 for 2020!"
4,"We stayed in this resort on June 2019 for 3 nights in connecting rooms 1436 and 1437.  We bought the voucher by travel agent, got cheaper price even when compared with World of Hyatt member rate. Breakfast for 2 person is included. I usually book the hotel stays by their own websites. Because sometimes I got free room upgrade or else. So I expect nothing here.  Check in time was longer than usual. Maybe because of high season. We got our room at 3:00 PM just at the normal check in time. Waited for about 1 hour but we got Veranda beverage voucher so we can wait more comfortably. Rooms a bit old but comfortable and the air con works well. The amenities were missed here and there (no toothbrushes), but we can call the housekeeping and they will provide.  Keep in mind that the…"

4,It’s been years since I last visited. Lots have developed but facilities are aging. Beautiful compound pool conveniently next to lovely private beach. Enjoyed the Pasar Senggol Buffet Dinner package. Was very lucky with the weather.

5,"Bali is beautiful, but what we will remember most is how the staff helped me and my wife feel so valued and cared for. They went above and beyond at every juncture and made this stay amazing.  Susanto the manager was so helpful for navigating tough issues. our AC stopped working and he helped us get in another room in the middle of the night. Even helped us with getting back to airport safely.  I've always wondered what the concierge does, but Unita and Sukriani helped me see them in action. They called the airline on behalf of me and my wife when we got stuck on Gili Islands due to bad weather. Unita worked tirelessly to find a way to get my sick wife home even when my passport was locked away in our room safe many miles away. From start to finish she took care of all our…"
5,"The room was great and big. All the staff was friendly and helpful. On the other hand, the quality of the restaurants is great.  The only bad thing I can say about the hotel is the quality of the buffet dinner show. It's a bit boring for the overall great quality of the hotel but you can avoid it."
5,"This is one of the best hotels at Nusa Dua. A fantastic location and lots of activities.The hotel is so big that you always have the sense you are the only people living there.A large number of restaurants and each one is a Culinary delight.From Frangipani(Italian) on the beach to the Japanese there's a place for everyone there. A huge swimming pool with a slide for the children,biking and an excellent Spa.The bar has a limited selection of snacks but an excellent vibe.Staff are friendly and courteous and there are some good places to shop within the hotel.The balinese dance is a must watch."
4,"Excellent place with serene views of the sea from the room. Polite & courteous staff but the room service leaves a lot to be desired. Lot of red ants and mosquitoes in the room. We left a tea cup on the table next to my wife's purse. Next morning not only the tea cup, but even the purse had ants all over. Beds are comfortable. There are multiple interconnected pools and they have numerous activities throughout the day. The hotel’s beach is very neat and offers great views at sunrise."
5,Great experience! Staff was so polite and helpful! Food and pools were also excellent! Rooms need a makeover but nothing major!   Located right opposite bali collection so we could easily walk and grab a meal when we were bored of eating in the hotel.   If u are going to Nusa Dua then this is the place to stay !

5,"Lots of comments about Hyatt being a bit dated and I can't disagree. We could hear pretty much everything that our neighbours were doing. But if you accept that, the Hyatt provides a really good beach experience. However, if you don't want to leave the resort be prepared to pay Aus prices + for your drinks. The 21% loading catches a lot of people out. Across the road is the 'Bali Experience' which is a little cheaper, but if you want real Bali prices be prepare to go a little bit further. If you are on a package deal the food is outstanding and the staff are great. Just be aware that you are 'tied' to the resort."
4,Quiet safe location near Bali collection. Staff so helpful. Fantastic warm pool with slide.  Food was expensive in Nusa Dua so include meals if possible. Great for little kids not teenagers. Negative was - No kids meals at pool bar.  
5,"We have been staying at the Grand Hyatt for over 15 years and have always loved the experience. The resort facilities, grounds, pool areas are simply stunning. We upgrade to the Club lounge that is absolutely stunning, the evening drinks and breakfast offering is the perfect way to start and end the day. As a family that travels extensively this resort is a family favourite. Well done to the entire team at Grand Hyatt, thanks for another perfect holiday. "

5,"Excellent place, for family if you want to enjoy and dont have to worry about kids and want to think of activities for them. The place is excellent to offer them many activities and safe space with very kind staff"
5,"Lots of comments about Hyatt being a bit dated and I can't disagree. We could hear pretty much everything that our neighbours were doing. But if you accept that, the Hyatt provides a really good beach experience. However, if you don't want to leave the resort be prepared to pay Aus prices + for your drinks. The 21% loading catches a lot of people out. Across the road is the 'Bali Experience' which is a little cheaper, but if you want real Bali prices be prepare to go a little bit further. If you are on a package deal the food is outstanding and the staff are great. Just be aware that you are 'tied' to the resort."
4,Quiet safe location near Bali collection. Staff so helpful. Fantastic warm pool with slide.  Food was expensive in Nusa Dua so include meals if possible. Great for little kids not teenagers. Negative was - No kids meals at pool bar.  
5,"We have been staying at the Grand Hyatt for over 15 years and have always loved the experience. The resort facilities, grounds, pool areas are simply stunning. We upgrade to the Club lounge that is absolutely stunning, the evening drinks and breakfast offering is the perfect way to start and end the day. As a family that travels extensively this resort is a family favourite. Well done to the entire team at Grand Hyatt, thanks for another perfect holiday. "

1,"Unless you have a huge family of bratty kids - go somewhere else. Nothing was impressive. The Hyatt Regency in Denpasar is FAR superior. I had a very unfortunate visit to the nail salon. Do not use!  All food and drinks were very unimpressive.  The bathroom should’ve been cleaner.   The only saving grace was the gym and Jasmini. She was wonderful. However, being solo - I couldn’t take single class offered."
5,"Our 2nd trip to the Grand Hyatt.  We stayed at the Grand Club and this is the place to relax completely.  The staff at the Grand Club are wonderful with a special mention to Mr. Urip and Mr. Adi - thanks so much for making it so nice for us.  The gardens are magnificent, Kirya Spa is so relaxing I wish I could live there !!  There are some things that need updating (furniture in rooms, the Gym), but we are not so interested in bling - we really value the care and attention of the staff, the beauty of the surroundings and the relaxation.  A good coffee machine in the rooms would be extra nice."
5,This was our second stay at this resort.  We requested the same room we had previously stayed in and were pleasantly surprised to be granted our wish.  Our room overlooked the tranquil emerald pool which is a great spot sit or swim for a few hours as it is away from the other pools and noise.  We stayed for 8 nights and intentionally chose to stay at the Grand Hyatt for the first part of our Bali holiday to unwind and relax.  The resort is full of Balinese architecture and the gardens are beautifully maintained.  We loved how expansive the grounds are.  We visited the Kriya Spa a number of times and the surrounds and service there are outstanding (tranquil and professional).  Staff were incredibly helpful and cheery at all times.  The room we had is a little tired but everything…
5,"Having stayed in several hotels around Bali, this is the pick so far.  Amazing gardens and pools, great location, friendly and effective staff. Breakfast at the Grand Club was up there with the best hotel breakfast I've ever had.  It is very nice to have the beach-side trail so handy and good quality gym - will definitely be back."
5,"With an 18 month old toddler and a number of holiday fails (our fault for attempting to holiday like we did pre kid) our friends suggested we try a resort. It worked!! Too easy!   This is family friendly. Lots of family fun in the water every day, easy to go back to room for a sleep and lots of other kids so our daughter could find a friend wherever she went.  Our daughter is adventurous and the staff are amazing with young children (apologies for the breakages) always remembering her name and giving her a wave and a smile and steering her away from danger.  Thanks Grand Hyatt Bali."

5,"Spent two nights in Bali at the Grand Hyatt..... and everything from the gorgeous hotel, the beautiful grounds, the fabulous room and - most importantly - the unbelievable  service from all of the staff was completely over the top. Specifically, the Club staff - Suderti, Yani, Bagus and Sarly - provided the most personalized, professional, friendly, efficient service. And this was all under the direction of Wiji, who went out of her way to make certain every part of our experience was above and beyond. Bali is truly amazing - and staying at the Grand Hyatt makes it even more so. A big THANK YOU to all who made it so......."
1,"The Grand Hyatt always feels like home away from home, all staff are very hospitable and generally glad to see you and welcome you back . the property is always clean with plenty of amenities whether your a couple or family."
3,Terrible Club Lounge food! One of the worst I’ve been amongst so many Hyatt hotels I’ve been to. Vastly needs improvement. Can you imagine even basic food like bacon and sausage was not available every day? I only had it twice after staying there for a week! 
5,"Lovely hotel.The staff were very helpful and friendly. The property itself is huge and lots of places to explore. We found every convenience we wanted especially since we were travelling with kids - atm on the property itself, 5min walk to Bali Collection etc."
2,"I paid for a connecting room and the smell was awful. Rooms were tired and ugly. Got a new set of rooms 45min later, same issue.  After 5 hrs in the resort and my membership not worth a thing I had to pay for an upgraded room. An extra $115USD per night, I was here for 9. With no other options we finally unpacked in the really expensive room and we had cockroaches running around all night. I trapped on in the shower, my husband killed 2 in the bath and there was one that died in the loo.  This is awful. Beds are average, breakfast is really average and the food here is ok but it gets real old real quick.  Grounds are long, hard and challenging if you have a disability or elderly. No loos near the kids pool so you have to trek the length of the grounds with wet kids to pee. And…"

5,"Here for a second time in 6 months and cannot recommend highly enough, the most amazing staff to create a memorable holiday, Mr Amrit, Bagus and Urip in particular (not taking away from all the other staff) this is becoming a second home and somewhere we will visit many many times again in future."
2,"This hotel and grounds really are beautiful, if a little tired and staff are friendly and warm and the location is great but would I stay here again? No. Whilst the hotel is fantastic for families, it is not suitable for those holidaying without children and hoping for some peace or tranquility. Despite this, it is marketed as a family friendly and couple friendly resort.   Apart from the gym, there was not one other area where we could escape the inevitable volume that comes with excited kids. Of all the bars and restaurants on site, a bar or a restaurant designated kid free would have been most welcome. I sound a grump but I object to paying the hefty prices of the restaurants and bars at this hotel to have my meal/drink marred EVERY single time by crying and shrieking little…"
5,From the moment we arrived we were more than happy with our decision to stay here.  The rooms were fantastic and ideal for a family of 5.  The pool and waterslide were a sure hit with the kids with the poolside cocktails a sure hit with us.  The staff were outstanding.  All restaurants were delicious and the luxurious spa on site was brilliant.
5,What a fantastic hotel to stay at.. the hotel could not have been more accommodating for my family.. the food and drinks are great.. will stay here again.. thank you to all staff who made our holiday so much better..
5,"I wrote a long review last year after our amazing stay at the Hyatt. This time we booked a Club Deluxe King Bed room and what a lovely room it turned out to be.  It was room 2128 which opened right on to the private Club Pool which was so convenient.   The room was large and the bathroom and dressing room was especially large with a door opening to the outside veranda to cater for those coming from the beach and pool. We were so close to the beach, just a very very short walk and we were on the beach. The pool itself is delightful and very quiet with the most comfortable lounge chairs.  The Club itself is worth every extra penny that we paid.  Breakfast each morning was fabulous with made to order eggs and other hot dishes plus delicious bread and cakes and all the things in…"

4,"Wow, we just had a great holiday through lux escapes staying for 10 nights with breakfast and dinners included.  The hotel is everything you would hope for as far as a tropical holiday with fantastic service, rooms, food, pools and beach.   Unfortunately though, despite the deal we purchased stating  ""And don’t forget children aged 11 years and under stay free with breakfast - now that’s holidaying!”  Kids under 3 aren’t allowed in the kids club. I don’t know about you but my definition of little one means kids including under 3 unless stated otherwise. Other places we have been to allow either a parent or guardian to accompany kids under 3 into the kids club but this place doesn’t allow that.   As we have a 2 and 4 year old, the kids club was useless as our 2 year old would…"
5,"Always feels like home there. Never get us bored.  The beach, the resort, the foods. Even the breakfast is one of the best in Bali! Also we've loved all the activities  such as biking around the resort and surfing lesson for our kids "
4,This is a very large resort that is directly on the beach so it's easy to find places to sit and many areas are shaded by trees. There are multiple pools with plenty of areas to sit. The resort's overall maintenance is good even though you can tell it's an older resort. The service levels are very good considering that this is a big resort with many rooms. Everyone we met was friendly and professional.  We are big fans of Hyatt and so we have stayed in many Hyatt's across the globe and this Grand Hyatt matches up well with our expectations. The Grand Club lounge is beautiful and well worth the upgrade cost. We enjoyed the ambiance of the open air lounge as much as we did the food and service.  The Italian restaurant on site was amazing. We normally try to only eat the local food…
5,"A 65th birthday treat! - the Grand Hyatt Bali was chosen because of its location and our previous experience of the Hyatt group of hotels. Our faith was justified and our expectations exceeded - a wonderful location and set amidst the best maintained gardens we have ever seen. Great food, great service - wonderful staff - thank you."
5,A very large complex with many rooms as well as numerous swimming areas' the staff were all very pleasant and helpful  ; the rooms were well set out with decks overlooking pool areas ; the room facilities were of high standard - good swimming on the beach at high tide ; breakfast were great with a great selection

5,"Awesome resort, restaurants all really good, service wonderful, upgraded to garden room worth every dollar overlooked pond ,gorgeous, 4 pools &lots of sunbeds to choose from, private beach with beds under beautiful trees, we felt very comfortable walking up the esplanade, "
4,"great good resort to stay with family, the best part was the water slide where just not kids but adults can enjoy too, and they have couple of swimming pool. Great big beach, where in the evening water leaves good part of beach and you can walk 20-50 meters inside the sea and collect shells too. nice environment, even small shops are built inside, with great hospitality. will surely return for next trip"
5,"We stayed for 8 nights on a luxury escape package and the value for 2 adults a 5yo and a 2yo was incredible. Most impressed with the size of the resort and the grounds/landscape is impeccable. Plenty to do within the resort for everyone. The service from everyone was amazing. Rooms were good, little dated but larger than most. We loved our time there and will definitely be back! "
5,We chose Grand Hyatt Bali for our family trip.  It was a very fantastic and pleasant stay. All staffs are very kind and the hotel was very well landscaped. The view of the private beach in front of the hotel was very beautiful.
3,"Hi, We stayed for 3 nights from 9th to 12th june. It was worth to say that the location was stunning on the beach.   However, we were quite surprised with the rooms as never expected from such Grand Hyatt brand. We choose connecting rooms as we are two families. Since we check in, we found lot of issues such as AC was too much noisy, requires cleaning. Dustbin spring was found broken. The main issue was connecting door for which the knob was not working. We called twice the room service to carry out repair of the same. However, it was not done during our stay. Wooden doors were jammed for bathroom and flappers were not working. it feels a quite high maintenance is required in this resort. Also Manager, needs to look it personally to address this issue. Hence, rooms were below…"

5,We can not fault at all. This was our second stay there and we are now planning our next trip for next year for my 40th...absolutely the most perfect place to stay in Bali. Couldn’t ask for better service or accommodation 
4,"Holiday ramadhan 2019 june old hotel but still maintain to hyatt quality.  Very clean and beautiful hotel. Nice location and relaxing swimming pool , with beach front. Few restaurants and good grand lounge club"
5,"The staff was so helpful, the check in experience also good, we wont wait for long to be assist. The pools are suitable for family and kids and enjoyable. The room spacious and good thing, the clean up the room 2 times in a day.  I wish we can coming back again for Holiday."
5,"We have just returned home from an 9nights,stayed at Grand Hyatt,It was absolutely sensational from start to end of stay.All the restaurants are great,the staff amazing and the facilities superb.Out 2 kids loved the kids club which was also included in the price. They watched a movie at the outdoor cinema every night, giving us the opportunity to indulge in lovely dinners and surroundings. We would go back in a heartbeat😍😍"
5,"I knew this hotel is kinda old. I have been to Bali so many times trying all sorts of hotels but never been to grand hyatt before which kinda odd because I do have hyatt membership points. But geez despite being an old hotel, it certainly didn’t disappoint.  Lobby is spacious and offers breathtaking ocean view. Pools are really great with slides for the kids. It has hot jacuzzi. Beach is really clean and certainly one of the best. Water is crystal clear and wave is big enough for kids and me to play. Restaurant breakfast is also great with small hiccups which was nothing. Location is in affluent neighbourhood, bali collection just across the road if you are looking for cafes and shops.   The moment I entered my room, I could smell the smell of an old room but as the air…"

5,"Best Room:  We LOVED room 3107. Best hotel:  Grand Hyatt Bali!!  It's soooo beautiful, classy and has the best service of anywhere we've EVER stayed! Tip:  If you have food allergies, let them know ahead of time.  Octarina was the one I emailed and she was so friendly and helpful plus fantastic in letting all their restaurants on the premises know about my food allergies. My impressions of the resort: You really realise where you’re staying is truly special, especially as soon as you walk out the beach-side gates.  There is a footpath (or sidewalk) that runs alongside the beach.  You can walk through the gates to access other properties.  As soon as you do, you feel like you’ve left a tranquil, wonderful paradise behind and entered reality. The beach becomes more narrow.  Lounge…"
4,"Recently had a lovely break at the Grand Hyatt. Chose the option to book a club room, and it is our third stay at the resort. Food and drink options at the Grand Club were fantastic, however the best asset this hotel has is its amazing staff. Nothing is ever too much trouble, and their efforts to take care of you do not go unnoticed. They also are respectful and always allow you to enjoy couple time. Metris met us on arrival, and check in was quick and hassle free. Urip and Sutri managed the club with excellence, and Jaz and Agus, Youni among all the staff were amazing. In fact it is almost unfair to name people individually as every single staff member was outstanding, including the chef who was a delightfully humble man who would always be interested in your culinary comments…"
4,If you are vegetarian bit trouble but others it's awesome and very well maintained.  Location is awesome so as hotel rooms. Swimming pools are good but timings are not acceptable... Staff was polite and helpful. 
3,"Hotel grounds and facilities very good, staff extremely friendly. Number of things however were disappointing and would put us of staying again as a young family, beds uncomfortable with low quality bedding, plastic feeling,  Kids club is for 3 year olds up and you can’t actually go play with your kid there, drop and go set up, we also had a one and half year old and we couldnt go play with our two kids there which is standard in any other hotel with such facilities, last issue was we arrived late on first night and our two young kids were sleeping at breakfast time the following morning, we asked to take some croissants  back to the room and this seemed to be an issue for the breakfast receptionist even though we had paid in full for breakfast.  Again hotel is nice and…"
4,"Great beach with plenty of shade. Soft sand and enough waves to be fun. Not for snorkelling. Good shade trees.   Hotel very large and confusing but beautifully laid  out gardens and pools. Food OK and service willing but not so professional. Very pleasant.   Rooms large and clean but a biT old. Not a problem. I suggest paying the extra for ‘Club’ rooms. The location is better, rooms newer and a very good Happy Hour 5-7pm with drinks and snacks. Breakfast location here is stunning and so calming."

Number of things however were disappointing and would put us of staying again as a young family, beds uncomfortable with low quality bedding, plastic feeling,  Kids club is for 3 year olds up and you can’t actually go play with your kid there, drop and go set up, we also had a one and half year old and we couldnt go play with our two kids there which is standard in any other hotel with such facilities, last issue was we arrived late on first night and our two young kids were sleeping at breakfast time the following morning, we asked to take some croissants  back to the room and this seemed to be an issue for the breakfast receptionist even though we had paid in full for breakfast.  Again hotel is nice and…"
4,"Great beach with plenty of shade. Soft sand and enough waves to be fun. Not for snorkelling. Good shade trees.   Hotel very large and confusing but beautifully laid  out gardens and pools. Food OK and service willing but not so professional. Very pleasant.   Rooms large and clean but a biT old. Not a problem. I suggest paying the extra for ‘Club’ rooms. The location is better, rooms newer and a very good Happy Hour 5-7pm with drinks and snacks. Breakfast location here is stunning and so calming."
4,"1. For those who likes to drive on their own this hotel provides valet service (some 5 stars hotels do not provide valet service), the lady at the front loby really quick on helping us and also greeted us (feel welcome) 2. checking in was fast 3. There are 5 pools in total within the hotel, but we can only use 4 pools, cant remember the reason why we cant use the fifth one, but great pool, my family and i really enjoyed spending time in the pool. 4. The hotel has their own private beach, real nice and clean, happy to see my daughter enjoyed playing here 5. Walking distance to bali collection  6. Breakfast was just ok, ( for those who never stay in this hotel, when you get your room, ask where is the breakfast for your area, we didnt get the information as we walked quite a…"
5,"Impressive hotel and location. You never get the impression you are in a 700 rooms' hotel. Huge and marvelous gardens, 3 different restaurants where you can have breakfast, plus a Japanese and a barbecue restaurant, hard to make a choice. 5 swimming pools all of them surrounded by a lush vegetation and  breathtaking gardens, with colorful flowers and  frangipani trees, ponds, waterlilly, squirrels, ducks, tiny birds, red carp fish and....friendly varano. It looks like a Monet painting. Pleasant room with a view on a peaceful pond. Sumptuous breakfast. Very elegant SPA with its own secluded swimming pool. Very wide sandy beach right in front of the main pool but some seaweeds, not the best for swimming. Although Nusa Dua is a gated holiday resorts area, the hotel is right in…"
5,"-Stayed for a week with my partner, another couple and their two boys aged 18mnths and 4.  -Beautiful rooms, gorgeous established property, amazing staff, range of great restaurants, pools etc.  -We had the add on of the Club Package (I think that’s what it’s called) and would really recommend this. It meant breakfast was included and access to the club pool which was beautiful. Also a big range of food and drinks available from late afternoon (which fed the kids easily)  -Great kids club and family pool with slides -The staff went above and beyond to help us when we had a medical emergency before arriving at the hotel. One of the duty managers Sarly, came with us in the hotel van to hospital and stayed to ensure I got medical treatment needed and was so well taken care of. When…"
1,"I am on my last night of 8 nights staying here. On my 4th day I went down the waterslide with my daughter and when landed, a broken tile on the pool floor cut my foot open. It was so bad that I almost needed stitches, I couldn’t swim for the rest of my stay (doctors orders said I couldn’t get it wet or dirty). Upon asking the hotel for a copy of the incident report to provide to my insurer, they have flat out refused saying it is internal policy not to provide one. I am extremely disappointed and upset. I missed out on 4 days of enjoying the resort facitilies because of the hotels negligence and now they are refusing my legal right to a copy of an incident report! Will never be back."
5,"Second visit to Bali as a family. Nusa Dua is simply stunning, much quieter than Kuta. With two children under 10 it felt a lot safer on the roads etc. I was worried it was going to be a lot more expensive but you could still get a meal for 4 for around 600-800 thousand rph. Obviously outside of the hotel! The hotel was magnificent we were there for 12days and I still don't think we saw it all. We were in a Grand Room which was easily big enough for our family. The swimming pools entertained the children all day especially with the flume.  There are a few ants around the pool so you need to keep your area clean from food.  We had bed and breakfast and had the choice of two locations to eat. The Garden Cafe is nearer the reception it is a bit cooler to eat here which some people…"

5,"Stayed 10 days, great service and nice having a choice of restaurants.  Quiet and secure.   Didn't take long to get to Kuta with 'Grab'. They were the only hotel that would guarantee adjoining suits for the family, thats what was our deciding factor"
5,"This is the 5th time at the Grand Hyatt and the 3rd time staying in the Grand Club. What can I say but wow wow. The staff really make the Grand Club they really make you feel like royalty. Yes the rooms are a bit tired, but who comes to Bali to sit in the room I certainly don’t. The beach is the best in Nusa Dua people moan about the rubbish on the beach if it bothers you that much get a bag and pick some rubbish up. The breakfast is really good there is something for everyone, the evening snacks and drinks are great especially the burgers yummy. I never want to leave my little peace of paradise and cry when it’s time to leave. A big thank you to all the staff to many to name but here are a few  Norman , strawberry lady the great reception staff, pool staff. But in my eyes the…"
4,Very friendly and helpfull staff. Good value for money. Location is perfect and the staff are very friendly which made everyday a joyfull experience. The food was good and everything was very clean and tidy.
4,"Stayed for 8 nights. Food was lovely and our service from Lisna (Cafe Garden) was exceptional, who just remembered all the small details on our trip. Hotel located near the Blow hole (10 min walk), great beach, pools and surrounds lovely. All staff extremely considerate,polite, attentive and courteous  Wish the hotel had a courtesy bus for surrounding areas to visit"
5,Amazing Service great people and a wonderful team....  I think the entire team made a huge contribution among the staff and was on point & top notch.  I enjoyed the entire atmosphere also and warm staff.  I think the community was a great feeling also.

5,This is surely one of the most wonderful resorts in Bali .Beautiful gardens wonderful well trained English speaking attentive staff nothing is to much to make your stay perfect .try to avoid school holidays if older as the children can be very loud screaming parents not caring let them take over pool and Resturants but apart from this 2019 parent problem most are great rooms large fantastic big beds veranda beach clean and perfect pools fantastic gym great food wonderful 
5,This hotel is outstanding. Its location in Nua Dusa means you have to take a taxi or hire a car to get around. Most of the tours provide pickup and drop off service and this hotel is located right on it's own semi private beach.
2,This resort is very tired and in need of much love. It is also not as children/family friendly as we had be told. We stayed here for 3 nights with our 3 children following 7 nights at the Padma Legian hoping that we would just be able to relax and enjoy the resort in Nusa Dua but the Padma Legian was far more relaxing and a lot better for kids with a more appropriate children’s pool and more slides. Kids club is also not free at the Grand Hyatt like it is at the Padma and many other resorts.
5,"I would like to express my special thanks or gratitude to your staff for making my stay feel at home and providing me with the best service renderable. The members who stood apart were Parnata from the pool area as well as Ravitha from Garden cafe. The extraordinary and remarkable service made my stay delightful yet entertaining. I really enjoyed myself. I would consider my stay at Grand Hyatt a golden opportunity, thanks to them."
5,"This may sound like the ultimate cliche but our stay at Grand Hyatt Bali - Nusa Dua was the stuff of dreams. The resort itself is beautiful - the landscapes, the cleanliness, the atmosphere and the sheer size of the place had us saying ""wow"" every time we turned our heads. The staff were brilliant - every single one of them were friendly, welcoming and willing to go above and beyond to make our stay the best it could be. The room was incredible, again you cannot fault them for cleanliness and presentation. We stayed in one of the ""grand rooms"" which had plenty of room for activities, the bathroom was huge too! The restaurants, namely the Garden Cafe and Salsa Verde were exceptional, the food was incredible... I lost count of the number of servings of mie goreng we ate at Garden…"

2,"had to change rooms because the ""standard"" room I booked and was assigned to had noise issues:  cars/motorcycles driving by (back of east village) , loud a/c noise (even when turned on low) and some unknown LOUD mechanical noise (north village facing east) from outside; maintenance guy told me it's the fan blowing noise from the restaurant below.  anyway very loud that I had to use the earplugs.  wtf.  ended up not changing anymore and stuck in a room with lots of noise issues.  I agree with other reviewers that this property is outdated and some/many rooms have noise issues.  if you have no issues with noise, it's a good property to stay.  otherwise, your days here might be all that pleasant.    for the lounge access, it's good.  I would say it's worth to pay the extra.  they…"
5,"Tonight we attended the Barong Dance at one of the great restaurants at Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua.  The atmosphere, ambiance, and restaurant setting was lovely with the sea breeze flowing through.  Meal - delicious, varied and plenty.  The waiting staff in our area were May (‘May Lucky’) and Sri (‘Sri Lanka’).   They were very kind, polite, and interesting and provided excellent service.  Their Manager was excellent and a lovely gentleman also.   Thank you - a most enjoyable evening. "
3,"The hotel was not so bad, our room was nice, but the beach area was so dirty..... and the pool area was very crowded....  We wanted to spend our time on a nice clean beach, but a lot of garbage was in the area....  Another think, they only had american breakfast, but we were in Bali, we wanted to tasty the local food.... We left the hotel next day very early in the morning..."
5,"Stay Duration: Three nights  Total Guests: 4 adults and 2 kids in 2 rooms  What we sought out: Our two families wanted rooms close to each other in a hotel which had a lot of moving space, easy access to clean beach, good food and a quiet place for the adults to relax.   Verdict on our expectations: Met on all counts and exceeded on a few.   Location: We were told time and time again that Kuta/Seminyak was the place to be when in Bali, but we decided against all those advice and chose Nusa Dua, specifically Hyatt. A great decision!! The beach was so close, so clean and beautiful! Its in the newly developed Nusa Dua area and therefore is humongous in hotel grounds. We later found out that its walk-able distance to the Bali collection shopping mall - shops and restaurants are…"
4,"We had booked ocean view but when we checked in , we were told that it has been upgraded to Executive view. Not sure , why someone will upgrade unless there is some issue with the booked room .I expressed my wish to get me the same type of room which I had booked, but that might not be available. Though, I had the ocean view from my room but it was little far. That is still ok. The only problem is , It should be communicated with customer in advance , so they wont be surprised at the last moment. That was the only concern. Otherwise, it is a very awesome and large property. You have ATM, Shops , Restaurant etc. Staff is friendly. For vegetarian , there are very less options. For non-veg, there are plenty. It is very beautiful and scenic property."

5,"This was our sixth time to Bali first time to Nusa Dua and the Hyatt.  We were travelling with our young children (ages 4 & 2) and their grandparents (age 65+).  The resort had something for everyone with stunning grounds, great pool area, and luxury spa.   It is a great resort for young children with all the different pools, water slides, beach and playground.  I recommend bringing some sand toys/pool toys/life jackets along with you.  Our 4 year old loved the kids club which had lovely attendants, ample activities, and a big selection of toys.  The cost is a little high but includes lunch if you stay for half a day.  The kids club is only for ages 3+.   The beach is the cleanest beach I have ever seen in Bali.  Yes- there is some rubbish in the water but the beach itself is…"
4,"This was the largest resort we stayed at while in Bali (out of 6 resorts).  This place had consistent hot water and water pressure, major plus in my book.  The room was nice, it overlooked the golf course, lotus pond and had a beautiful ocean view.  I did get a picture of a Monitor Lizard (maybe a Komodo?).  Lots of wild life here (not in the room, no critters spotted in the room). Check in was nice, staff was pleasant and welcoming. They have a little shopping village on premises (and are right next door to the Bali Collection).   Room is a good walk to the front desk area.  Beach area is very nice, kid friendly.  Nice water slide and pool area.  Great pizza at the Italian Restaurant! They were having a conference when we were there.  Prices seemed to reflect this as we were…"
4,"This is an exclusive resort with a lovely stretch of beach. The foot print of this property is large so expect walking and lots of steps. I personally do not think It is age friendly for the seniors and those with a bad knee.   Many pools in this hotel. But it doesn’t beat the sea. Waves are strong and isn’t good for swimming. Kite flying is easy from the looks of it.   Food in the hotel is not great. Balinese dishes are weird tasting . Western dishes are not quite there e.g. eggs Benedict, cannot make it.   We enjoyed a seafood bbq meal at Bali connection just outside our gates. That was good. Visited Starbucks reserve in town. Otherwise traffic congestion is common.   Overall, a restful holiday. But the special grand Hyatt service is missing here."
1,"I would never go there again.   Breakfast at the grand lounge was sub optimal. Went to the regular breakfast buffet also. Staff at the entrance were absolutely rude and unfriendly. Untrained and very poor comprehension added to the problem.   Croissants and bread was stale.   The suite was a lovely size and well appointed. However the bed curtains were torn and lacked a privacy partition between the bedroom and bathroom especially if traveling with friends, this is a big problem.   Overall the property is quite old, but maintained well. However it is not worth the price at all compared to several other hotels in Bali. And most disappointing is the poor standard of training and service offered by the staff on several points of contact.   I would not recommend this property. And…"
5,"All the staffs greet you with Balinese signature smile. The receptions helped us booked our trip and suggested a handful of nice destination for us to visit.  The garden is well maintained and full of wildlife (lizards, fishes, birds and ducks). It's like living in a paradise.  Multiple pools for you to swim in. House beach filled with white and fluffy sand. Good waves too.  Overall an excellent experience. Can't think of a bad thing. "

1,"Extremely outdated Hotel that is screaming for a renovation ,we checked in for 5 nights had to check out the next day and find another hotel, nothing in our dated room worked , the AC was not working , the mini fridge was not working even the power sockets were not working, the cheapest thing in the room the hot water kettle that can be replaced for a minimal cost was from the 70’s rusted ,disgusting and the best not working 😃😃.  The hotel is supposed to be a five star , but I have stayed two star hotels that are significantly better.  I have never checked out of a hotel early because of a crapy room and hotel this was the first , hopefully Hyatt can do something to update this property, till then stay away and save your money!"
4,"the hotel was in great shape considering some of the reviews I read, very clean and rooms are comfortable. Pool is great, wish it would open a bit earlier then 8 am. Spa also a must experience. Plus is the beach front, although there are many hotels lined up it still felt uncrowded"
4,"We stayed 3 nights at the Grand Hyatt Club rooms.  The hotel appears to have had a recent refurbishment will our room/furniture appearing fresh and clean.  The club area was a wonderful experience set over one of the hotels many ponds with fish, birds and large lizards all surrounding the area.  Food/Drink/Service in the club was fantastic.  The beach at the hotel sets the Grand Hyatt apart from other hotels in the area.  The hotel has one of the longest, cleanest stretches of beach in the area.   I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt Bali."
3,"Its a beautiful resort, the beach is clean and vast. The breakfast is nothing to shout about and the service could be better (no friendly smiles, no greetings, no personalization and definitely not the Balinese hospitality i've grown to enjoy). The kids club is chargeable but the staff are attentive and great with the kids so money well spent. "
2,"A little unorganized. Staff are super nice and friendly. However, if you booked it on rewards prepare for no breakfast (which I was told there was), unless you’re at the top tier of the membership....lame. If you do buy breakfast it cost 59 USD, which if it’s palatable it would be worth it. Room stinks of bleach and mold. It seems like they need to invest in some dehumidifier system to control it. The atmosphere is probably what you’re paying for. Sadly I will be coming back on the 27th.  Let’s hope it changes my mind. "

4,"the hotel was in great shape considering some of the reviews I read, very clean and rooms are comfortable. Pool is great, wish it would open a bit earlier then 8 am. Spa also a must experience. Plus is the beach front, although there are many hotels lined up it still felt uncrowded"
4,"We stayed 3 nights at the Grand Hyatt Club rooms.  The hotel appears to have had a recent refurbishment will our room/furniture appearing fresh and clean.  The club area was a wonderful experience set over one of the hotels many ponds with fish, birds and large lizards all surrounding the area.  Food/Drink/Service in the club was fantastic.  The beach at the hotel sets the Grand Hyatt apart from other hotels in the area.  The hotel has one of the longest, cleanest stretches of beach in the area.   I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt Bali."
3,"Its a beautiful resort, the beach is clean and vast. The breakfast is nothing to shout about and the service could be better (no friendly smiles, no greetings, no personalization and definitely not the Balinese hospitality i've grown to enjoy). The kids club is chargeable but the staff are attentive and great with the kids so money well spent. "
2,"A little unorganized. Staff are super nice and friendly. However, if you booked it on rewards prepare for no breakfast (which I was told there was), unless you’re at the top tier of the membership....lame. If you do buy breakfast it cost 59 USD, which if it’s palatable it would be worth it. Room stinks of bleach and mold. It seems like they need to invest in some dehumidifier system to control it. The atmosphere is probably what you’re paying for. Sadly I will be coming back on the 27th.  Let’s hope it changes my mind. "
1,"To celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary we booked this property but our experience was horrible. Air conditioner was not working till check out, muddy water was coming in hot water tap and staff was unable to do anything. We never experienced such kind of poor staff behaviour and if any problem comes with utility we expect alternate arrangement immediately. Our holiday was totally spoiled and we don't recommend this old property to any one at all. "
5,"We have stayed at this magnificent hotel many times over the last thirty or so years.  We keep coming back for a number of reasons:  friendliness and care of the staff, the beauty of the entire hotel, cleanliness of the rooms, care that is taken of the gardens and grounds, two wonderful pools, a number of good restaurants, etc. just to name a few!!  And, the Grand Hyatt is directly on the Indian Ocean on one side with the Bali Collection of shops and restaurants within a five-minute walk of the hotel on the other side!  What could be better than all of these selling points!  It is a wonderful hotel which I can highly recommend to any vacationer or even business traveler!"
5,What a lovely holiday! The Grand Hyatt is one of the most beautiful hotels i've ever been to. The rooms were very clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel is in a good location and has a beautiful beach. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.
5,"We had a great get away to relax by the pool and not be bothered by anything, surrounded by great gardens and super friendly staff who go out of their way to help solve any issue you may have. The hotels restaurants provide good quality food with some excellent options at a reasonable price. The location is good, being walking distance to Bali Collections where you can shop quietly with out the hassles of the downtown crowd, there are some good walking trials as well that enable you to explore the area either by foot or on bike. Good place to take the family away from the crowd and spend time together by the pool"
4,"The Grand Hyatt is so well positioned, it is on a great beach and has the most convenient Italian Restaurant on the beach. The food in all the venues is good, the service is excellent and they have a very good Kids Club. The location couldn't be better its right across the road from Bali Collection shopping centre yet in a quiet part of Bali at Nusa Dua. This is a kid-friendly Hotel"

4,"Although this hotel is very clean and well maintained it lacked the personal touch that you get from smaller resort accommodation, check in, walk round, check out. no real engagement with visitors. The rooms don't really match up to 5 star although adequate there was no wow factor."
5,"Pizza, wine glorious sunset on the beach, cocktails by the pool, attentive staff these are the memories we take away from the Grand Hyatt Bali..... PS stop by the Ralph Lauren / Polo store in the Hotel's shopping area for surprising great value......     "
3,"We were disappointed with our overall Luxury Escapes experience at the Grand Hyatt - limited, repetitive food and beverage menus. Whilst the external appearance of the hotel is impressive, the Guest rooms in my opinion are in need of attention to maintain a 5-Star rating."
5,"This is not a new hotel, and some might say it would benefit from a light refurbishment, but the quality of service is exceptional and the beauty of the environment is outstanding.  The quality of service exceeds any expectations and that is what sets this hotel apart for us.  Having travelled extensively with our work we now enjoy our retirement.  We now look for different qualities in our accommodation and the Hyatt at Nusa Dua provides exacty what we are looking for.  Great, personal service, attention to detail and extremely well trained, attentive and friendly staff. We will be back. AGAIN."
5,"My 18th stay at the Grand Hyatt and my best as staff were amazing and helpful - important as in remission from Cancer and they made it so easy , The Grand hyatt has by far the largest and best beach in Nusa Dua with plenty of space if you want on the beach which we did having about 200 feet of beach to ourselves every day so amost a private beach but also a great feature pool if you prefer . Food is great and waiter service is quick and polite, the rooms although older now are fully functional and give great views so look at pics from the hotel website as we tried another hotel 6 years ago booked in for 2 weeks and left after 2 hours as not a patch on the Hyatt, convenient for local Bali collection shopping Mall and easy walk for local street restaurants on Pantai Manyat so…"

5,"Had a 5 night stay in grand hyatt, nusa dua. Very tranquil and very peaceful place for family trip. If you plan to visit ubud or other places of interest it would be a 1-2 hr drive in traffic so factor in that. Nusa dua where the hotel is self sufficient with it own restaurants and small shopping center and private beach within the hotel."
5,"There are four restaurants lots of daily activities and a very big spa, so plenty of things to do for at least 5 days. The gelato is excellent and there is a happy hour promotion so can get one gelato and second for free. I twisted my ankle and the clinic at the resort is very good, well stocked and very cheap"
5,"What an amazing hotel, hard too know where too start! I will say our only negative experience over the whole trip was after the 17hour flight from the UK and a 4 hour stopover in Doha, arriving at Bali airport is the worst thing ever. we waited 2 and a half hours at immigration then a further half an hour at the ""NOTHING TO DECLARE""! Not a good 1st impression. However when we got through we were delighted that our driver had waited for us as he said its normal for it to take an hour plus at immigration! Tho others had said their transport had left them. So onto the hotel,soon as we arrived we were greeted with a drink, a cold flannel and a very easy check in. Baring in mind we arrived at about 3am, the staff were so smiley, it was so nice. We were on a B&B basis. Room was…"
5,Trip was organised for the family by my son. We could not have started at a better hotel. Rooms and location were all we could have asked with all 3 adjacent. Food was excellent  and service first class
5,"We spent 4 very relaxing nights in a club room at the Grand Hyatt.  The room was very clean and spacious with a lovely ocean view.  The afternoon “happy hour” is brilliant, one of the best we’ve had.  The pool area is quiet with lots of shade but that’s how we like it and the beach is right next to the pool so you have the best of both worlds. The Spa is beautiful and you must have at least one treatment.  I can highly recommend staying here."

5,"Had a beautiful stay at the Grand Hyatt. Ideal if you are traveling with children - ours loved the pool and slides. The grounds are truely stunning, and great to be able to walk straight out onto the beach. Make sure you treat yourself at the day spa - it’s divine."
5,"It was a great stay! Good pools and fantastic beach. Because of all the plastic on the beach, the hotel should encourage the guests to clean up - maybe do an event one or twice a week. People will gladly join. Good for awareness, and also a chance for people to teach their children."
3,"If you want to upgrade to the next category, the rooms are all facing the garden and not exactly seeing the ocean. So there is no need to upgrade. The food at the buffet spread was not very yummy. It could have been better if simple omelette can be mastered "
5,"Botanical garden 5 star hotel right on the beach with amazing staff and food. Couldn’t be happier. Had such a great time had all amenities you could ask for. Lots of complimentary items and services, 10/10 by far."

5,"The staff make this hotel make you feel very welcome and are genuinely happy to help you,  not the feeling you think may receive in a big resort.  Very personal. The grounds are beautiful and always well maintained, the ponds with koi, ducks included 🦆🦆, lizards and  lotus flowers very pretty. Walking to the restaurants or pool is scenic as there are lots of statues and ponds, large palms and trees to shade from the sun around the property and to the beach. The beach had some shade and sun loungers as well and they clean the sand as much as possible after the tides.  Nusa Dua is a quieter area and family friendly if you want to spend your days by the pool or early morning walks before you start your day by the pool!  "
5,The room was spacious and well appointed with top notch amenities. Staff were very courteous and accomodating always willing to help us out with a smile on their face! We ordered minutes just before the last call at the pool bar but the staff did not hesitate to take our order we just requested to have it to go as to not keep the staff waiting for us. The amenities are amazing!! There are so many pools and the beach is amazing. The area is very good for families travelling with kids as there are a lot of activities for kids. 
4,a lovely hotel that is well located next to bali collection and on a nice stretch of private beach. the hotel grounds are beautifully kept but the rooms whilst spacious are extremely dated and the air conditioning is capped at a level where it still feels too hot at night - I assume to save costs. The gym and spa facilities are lovely but again - not cold enough to feel comfortable working out in heat. the hotel has a daily Indonesian show that happens each night at dinner - its incredibly boring and repetitive with no other entertainment to keep families/kids entertained each night. the pool is nice and its length and size means it never feels over crowded. food options are ok - bit repetitive again if you are there any longer than 5-7 days. staff are very friendly. good…
4,"Even though my wife wasn't sure about the room as it is a little dated, we still had a good stay here. The food is good, but expensive, but the staff is really friendly. She loved spending most of her time on the beach, which was really clean."
5,"We had very pleasant and relaxing 4 days in Grand Hyatt.We stayed in a Club level room and it was great,the best part was the Club lounge open sided area on a lagoon,very peaceful to switch off from every day routine.Food choice was good,service was great and staff attentive and friendly."

1,This is NOT a 5 star resort. I can’t believe people have given this hotel so many good reviews. Makes you wonder and also makes you realize people have very different standards.  Upon checking in it was tedious. No one knew what was going on. After 40 minutes we were finally taken to our room. Outside above the door the ceiling was falling apart and there was a wooden plank to hide the hole (not very well I might add). When the door was opened a huge wave of mould hit is in the face. It was horrific!!! So bad for your health! When we complained they told us to open the door open. We checked other rooms with the same outcome. At $600 a room per night it’s absolutely horrible. The rest of the resort was also so rundown!  Clearly we left and checked into a proper 5 star resort the…
5,"Thank you for a wonderful stay! You went above and beyond to ensure I was happy, including  upgrading me to a suite. Thank you for the special treatment and support of my business. I am grateful. Sorry for the late review. Your food and service was impeccable!  Can’t wait to return with my colleagues for our yearly holiday. As it is my treat to my staff I can’t wait to re-experience what I experienced.  Thank you again!"
3,"Good: - swimming area and waterslide for the kids - quieter Balinese pools near guest rooms - spacious rooms, easily could have fit 2 kids on day bed if needed  Bad: - ants in our room every day  - linens smelled like mildew and housekeeping was not thorough  - didn’t honor the promotion for 2 massages at the spa - food options are limited and overpriced - beach is strewn with garbage and there are no umbrellas or shade near the water"
5,"We were met by staff who couldn’t do enough for us and this continued through out our stay. We upgraded to grand member this was well worth it. Fantastic room, snacks and all alcohol between 6-7. Snacks so good we didn’t need a meal after on some occasions. Pool area for members very quiet and relaxing "
3,"Beautiful grounds and great location. However, the service is very variable. The Japanese restaurant was very good but the Italian restaurant was poor. One very disappointing aspect was that only wines by the glass offered throughout the entire resort was an Indonesian branded wine which was poor quality. This detracts significantly from any dining experience in the resort.  "

3,"It was our 4th anniversary and we planned for a short 3 nights of stay there. Hotel gifted us a fruit platter with 1 massage oil and a pack of bath salt, which we really appreciated it. Our house keeper June / Junie was so helpful, so cheerful and pleasant. We tried all of the restaurant and loved all of them except Garden Cafe! We ordered a very nice burger in Pool restaurant salsa verde , when we ordered the same burger again in garden cafe, the burger patty was so soggy and falling into crumbles after the first bite... simply ewwwww!! Amazing ambiance in the Japanese restaurant Nampu , food and especially Japanese wine are extremely over-priced though, we didn’t order much. The crab was a little overcooked, not too likeable for a Japanese like myself. On our last day, we…"
3,I am currently staying at the Grand Hyatt Bali and a few times i have asked staff for a buggy for my elderly father who struggles to walk long distance. The complex is huge and main facilities are a long walk away. Staff tell me no buggy service available however a number of times i have sat at the main pool and seen a buggy go past carrying people. I think it is disgraceful that this hotel does not accomodate such a service for less able to be mobile.
5,The hotel design is very nice gives you the feelings of Bali style and culture. Very huge hotel and staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good with nice seating. A beautiful beach is also there. Love the hotel entrance and the welcoming.
5,A great place for a family holiday with lots to do. Great location. locals are very friendly and helpful very relaxing. Lots and amazing food better than i expected. Out door dining and a show was great. 
1,"This stay did not go quite as planned for us, so much that we had to cut our stay short by 3 nights. The hotel accommodated our request for an early check out when we said we were very unhappy with the service. Strangely though, no one asked us what the problems were exactly.. We got an ocean view room (room number remained a mistery to me for most of our stay, as the numbers seem to have fallen off the door (fully) and the wall next to the door (in part) a while back, and never re-attached. In a 5-star hotel, really?! Now, the ocean view room in reality was a partial view at best, but that of course wasn’t a real issue. Toilet door was broken when we arrived, and did not fully close, so we had to wait an hour in the room until someone came to fix it. Good - because that’s how…"

3,"Stayed here for 10 nights with my husband and this was our first trip to Bali.  I will start with the positives: The resort was pristine, the gardens and pond areas were beautiful  Our room was very nice and spacious 4 bottles of water provided each day Good location in Nusa Dua Staff in bar area and breakfast areas are lovely   Negatives: Extremely over priced- a sprite with tax was around $8 AUD- so ridiculous. I understand you are going to pay a bit more in a resort but I feel they are excessive with the charges   When we checked in there was a dispute over the amount of money I handed the staff as I was paying for our stay in cash. I handed them 25 million rupiah which had been triple checked by myself and my husband, handed it to them and after a few minutes of counting the…"
5,"The Grand Hyatt is one of the oldest hotels in Nusa Dua. Therefore it occupies the largest and most prime property on the gorgeous beach strip in Nusa Dua. No other hotel in Nusa Dua can compete with The Hyatt, when it comes to the amazingly landscaped lawns, ponds, streams and walkways, they are simply the best. The hotel is huge and spread over a considerable expense of land. Unlike the other hotels on the beach, all the f&b outlets are set away from the beach so it does seem a lot more laidback compared to its neighbouring properties. The service is reassuringly Hyatt, which means top notch"
5,Stayed at grand hyatt for a week. Enjoy the view from the room and the breakfast is not bad too. The beach is a bit dirty at times. The waves bring in so much rubbish and no one there to clean it. Hope the management can pay more attention to that.  I don't enjoy food at salsa verde. I thought the pizza is a bit too salty and the carbonara was too creamy.  The services are top. Everyone were friendly. Not many hotels in nusa dua is. So i can give five stars for the service.  Rooms are particularly big compare to other hotels in bali so if you don't like small room then go for Grand Hyatt Bali.  Thank you for memorable and enjoyable stay
5,The best value is to book Club rooms as they off complementary breakfast and late afternoon finger food and drinks. Many guests use these as their primary meals.   There us a great running path next to the beach. Just outside the hotel gate is the Bali Collection for casual shopping and multiple mud tier restaurants   We enjoyed relaxing under the shade trees at the beach.   
5,"We stayed for 7 nights and were very happy through out our stay. We’ve got upgraded (for free) from King Club room to the Executive Suite, which worked perfectly for us. The extra living room was very helpful when we have a family visit."
3,"Stayed here for 10 nights with my husband and this was our first trip to Bali.  I will start with the positives: The resort was pristine, the gardens and pond areas were beautiful  Our room was very nice and spacious 4 bottles of water provided each day Good location in Nusa Dua Staff in bar area and breakfast areas are lovely   Negatives: Extremely over priced- a sprite with tax was around $8 AUD- so ridiculous. I understand you are going to pay a bit more in a resort but I feel they are excessive with the charges   When we checked in there was a dispute over the amount of money I handed the staff as I was paying for our stay in cash. I handed them 25 million rupiah which had been triple checked by myself and my husband, handed it to them and after a few minutes of counting the…"
5,"The Grand Hyatt is one of the oldest hotels in Nusa Dua. Therefore it occupies the largest and most prime property on the gorgeous beach strip in Nusa Dua. No other hotel in Nusa Dua can compete with The Hyatt, when it comes to the amazingly landscaped lawns, ponds, streams and walkways, they are simply the best. The hotel is huge and spread over a considerable expense of land. Unlike the other hotels on the beach, all the f&b outlets are set away from the beach so it does seem a lot more laidback compared to its neighbouring properties. The service is reassuringly Hyatt, which means top notch"
5,Stayed at grand hyatt for a week. Enjoy the view from the room and the breakfast is not bad too. The beach is a bit dirty at times. The waves bring in so much rubbish and no one there to clean it. Hope the management can pay more attention to that.  I don't enjoy food at salsa verde. I thought the pizza is a bit too salty and the carbonara was too creamy.  The services are top. Everyone were friendly. Not many hotels in nusa dua is. So i can give five stars for the service.  Rooms are particularly big compare to other hotels in bali so if you don't like small room then go for Grand Hyatt Bali.  Thank you for memorable and enjoyable stay

1,"We were excited to stay in the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua for our last night in Bali. However, we were very disappointed and left feeling uncomfortable and unwelcome after our stay.  Two incidents had a negative impact on our stay.   First, when ordering a meal via room service we were told that we needed to pay in cash. When I requested to add the meal to the room bill, I was told this was not possible. After multiple phone calls, I thought I had managed to open a bill for the meal. However, once delivered the room service attendant continued to request for cash. In fact, the attendant would not leave the room and called multiple staff using the room phone before agreeing to open a bill. We have not stayed in any hotels where ordering meals has been so difficult to add to a room…"
4,"The Grand Hyatt is a beautiful hotel which is well maintained with a fabulous location right on the picturesque beach. Our room was large and fitted our party of two adults two small children family just fine. Whilst it is slightly dated the cleaners are amazing and it was spotless. Water was replenished every day.   As you are fairly out of the way of anything, the hotel prices are about the same as AUD with foods like pizza, fish and chips and burgers costing around $18 a pop. Don’t forget the hotel adds a 21% service charge to everything you order. Or you can head to the shopping centre Bali Collection right next door where it’s much cheaper to eat and drink.   We had breakfast included which was fine but a little same same. Also their method of making pancakes to order was…"
4,"This is one of the oldest resorts in Nusa Dua (if not the oldest) and that has it's pros and cons. The grounds and lagoons are beautiful but like other reviews mention, the rooms are a bit tired. Having said that, we requested ground floor Emerald pool view rooms and they are a really decent size. Steps away from a Balinese style pool which hardly anyone visited, I think because most other guests weren't aware it was there. This was our second visit using a Luxury Escapes package and once again we had a fabulous time. The staff left a lovely bouquet of flowers in my room with a card for my birthday (thank you!). The service is gracious and friendly and the spa is one of the best I've ever visited. A couple of highlights for us were the huge swimming pools and the Teppanyaki…"
3,"The good - the very extensive grounds are beautifully kept with exotic plants, many water features, lots of exotic bird life, (you can watch kingfishers and egrets/herons looking for fish in the grounds), and tranquil, visually attractive areas.  The staff are just wonderful! Respectful, polite, attentive, an absolute pleasure and very much what Bali is famous for.  The public areas are clean, lots of marble, nice touches like local musicians playing in the main (outdoor) foyer and really pleasant. The booking in was a very pleasant experience. The restaurants are fine, not wildly upmarket, but the food is good and service excellent. The Garden Cafe staff are wonderful. The not so good - the complex is very large - if you have any mobility issues you will likely struggle as you…"
4,We didn’t stay at the Grand Hyatt as we were staying down the road but we were pleasantly surprised to find the Hyatt having gorgeous tropical landscape gardens to stroll around .We ended up having lunch at Salsa Verde which was lovely.   We were extremely excited to find out the hotel also had a water slide which our grandchildren were very happy about. The hotel is totally suited to families.   The hotel is located on the beachfront & is one of the oldest so it does have a nice Balinese decor & ambience.

4,Would recommend the Grand Club to get some respite when necessary from the crowded general areas. There was a Nuskin convention going on with many attendees staying in the hotel from China. There's a private pool which is quiet and pleasant.
5,The Grand Hyatt Bali is a beautiful beachfront resort in Nusa Dua. We stayed in a Club-level room & it was outstanding. The Club Lounge was open-sided on a lagoon. The food & drinks were delicious & we enjoyed the wildlife that we could view from the lounge. An overall perfect stay.
1,"We booked for 8 nights really excited for the water slides. Water slides ok for very small children. Not for 8 and 12 year olds. Bare minimum in rooms. photos very deceptive. Not even a razor or cotton bud in the room. Booked a family room and kids meals aren't included... Leaving early. Very disappointed Hyatt!! BTW everything is is extra even kids club, tv....."
4,"We had a great time here.  Rooms are a little dated but the staff, food and facilities are fabulous.   Good and drinks a little expensive but for Nusa Dua that’s is to be expected.  The beach is the s far better than at other hotels we have stayed at in Nuda Dua.  We had a great time"
5,"After a 2,5 weeks of travelling from Java to Bali, and having visited a numerious kind of luxury hotels and resorts on the way, we were supposed to have our cherry on the cake in the Grand Hyatt Bali to spend our last 8 days of Holiday.  The arrival was mostly welcome and warm. We were checking in and guided to our room by a very friendly member of staff.  But......when she opened the door to our room there was a big, big disappointment. The size of the room was far of what we had expected. This was just a standard city centre hotel room with a very limited space to walk around and not even to mention the size of the toilet.....Totally unacceptable to spend here 8 days for a holiday! And no......it was not the fault of the hotel, our travel agent had booked this roomtype for us.…"

5,"Regular holidayers in Bali this was only the second time staying in Nusa Dua and the Grand Hyatt ticked all our boxes. The rooms were spacious, well maintained and serviced. The pools and beach were great and our 7 year old grand daughter had a ball on the water slides and swimming at the beach. The breakfasts were great with plenty of variety and being close to Bali Collection provided plenty of shopping and eating options. We thoroughly enjoyed our six night stay"
5,"We just stayed 4 nights with our 2 young kids. Our room overlooked the beautiful ponds and had one king bed and one large daybed which was more than enough space for our kids 8 & 6 yrs to sleep.   The staff are amazing, so friendly and could not do enough for you. I got flowers delivered to my room for my birthday that had been 2 days before we arrived, extra water appeared in our room when they knew my daughter wasn't feeling well....all little touches that made it such a special stay. The lagoon pool is beautiful, plenty of sunbeds and the water slide was of course a big hit with the kids. The beach out the back was clean and beautiful for swimming as well. Breakfast was great, not a massive selection, but enough. We ate lunch and dinner in the hotel as well which was…"
4, The service was very good in all departments. The room was cosy ...the a/c & the bathroom could improve to meet modern standards. The location is very good ...overall the breakfast buffet could change to have some different menu varieties as many travellers stay on a package tour of more than 5 days. 
3,"This property is beautifully situated on the beach at Nusa Dua and like all Grand Hyatt's it's well..pretty grand.  I will say that the rooms although super spacious are tired and in need of a refurbishment.  The staff are super friendly and attentive.  The room I was given faced onto the sea but had a 24 hour power plant which was noisy even with the external balcony door shut.Added to that, there was a connecting door and a very boisterous family next door so I could hear everything that was going on including scraping of chairs."

5,"My friends and I love the Grand Hyatt. It’s beautiful with lots of swimming pools and great restaurants. Prices for food was surprisingly reasonable, around $10 to $22 U.S. dollars. I highly paying extra for breakfast buffet. You will enjoy and we will stay here again when in Bali.  PRO TIP: HIRE A PRIVATE DRIVER TO TAKE YOU EVERYWHERE. AROUND $50 USD PER DAY, INCLUDES ADMISSIONS AND LUNCH!!!"
5,"Our family of 4 had a fab stay at the Grand Hyatt in a suite, which was so spacious and well appointed (3x TV's with many news and movie channels & strong WiFi)... so much so that it was difficult to get hubby to leave the room each day!   We were spoilt for choice each morning at the hotel's breakfast buffet with plenty of freshly cooked pastries, eggs any style, fresh fruit and juices, and even mickey mouse shaped pancakes for the kids made to order.   We joined in the morning pool exercise class taken by a super charismatic Balinese man, and spent most of the days relaxing by one of the many pools. There were always plenty of poolside loungers to choose from either in shady or sunny spots.   Thanks go to the resort team who were super friendly and accommodating with our…"

As usual, i still love this hotel's massive river pool and slides. Our second time to same hotel but i don't think their hotel system doesn't recognise our booking name and i even told the staff this was our second time. No surprise by the hotel found. lol  we booked via expedia and it sucks. we chose ocean view and when we got to hotel, the staff informed us that the booking was for normal room and they assigned the room just next to car park i think where we can hear the noise and it was way too far from the lobby. i brought my son 3 years old kid so it's not practical. so we had no choice but…"
5,The Grand Hyatt BALI was such a good surprise and is absolutely beautiful. I was expecting a basic resort type of hotel and I didn't want this experience when visiting BALI. To my pleasure and surprise it was a stunning resort with a corner side of the beach that was completely their own. Multiple pools and so much to do on the resort itself. It was an amazing place to see the southern part of BALI and see the beaches.

The Pros: - Great service, very nice people - The resort is very beautiful and pleasant to walk around in  - Great location, right by Nusa Dua beach which is extremely clean and pristine - Many choices for restaurants, particularly enjoyed dinner at Pasar Senggol with fun Indonesian performance and good local food  The Cons: - We booked the Ocean View Room but it was on the ground floor and there was no view of the ocean which was a huge disappointment - The room service food was bland  - Was taken to the wrong room initially, then had to walk another 10 minutes to get to the right room  Overall, it was a fun stay but for a five-star resort it can be better."

5,"We stayed for two nights at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua following an ocean cruise from Sydney to Bali.  We had previously stayed at Four Seasons properties (Ubud and Jimburan Bay), which are justifiably admired.  Well, we actually prefer the Grand Hyatt, which comes it at substantially less.  What makes the difference is that the beautiful beach at Nusa Dua, and the restful and beautiful grounds of the entire Nusa Dua resort.  The Grand Hyatt's grounds are beautifully landscaped, wandering down to the beach.  The room way stayed in (an ocean view in the East complex) was spacious and well-appointed.  The staff throughout the resort were gracious and helpful.  And a bonus is that the main shopping center for the Nusa Dua complex is right outside the Grand Hyatt's entrance, which…"

A huge property divided into 4 villages, it has 5 pools, an amazing gym, multiple dining choices and basically everything you need for a large resort experience. There is a long white sand beach in front of the hotel (there is even a tractor that grades the sand in the morning for you) and a large shopping mall behind it.  Staff is friendly, accommodating and doing their best to keep up the luxury feel of the property.  FYI - This is Bali and there can be bugs, especially during wet season - it is a fact of life and even the Four Season has bugs.  Why Stay here – Very secure, extremely family friendly with lots of resort amenities. Runners paradise, wet season surfing, excellent work out facilities. Kid Zone/Camp Hyatt area is amazing…"
5,"I have stayed here many, many times. To be exact 15 times in the last 10 years. So its pretty self explanatory why our damily continue to re-visit. A++ A MASSIVE THANK YOU to all at Grand Hyatt and for their service. Very happy"
4,"Excellent places for families with young children.  The water slide was a great draw card for the kids. Pasar Sengol buffet and show was good, Nampu set Teppanyaki menu expensive but great taste. Only downside was the beds felt like sleeping on a rock.  Great shopping across from the hotel, not the typical cheap crap sold on the beaches but more department store goods. Great well priced food at Bali collections, recommend Moon Cheer restaurant for the music and ribs."
4,"Loved the room service, staff was helpful and kind. Only big flaw which is the biggest one is, it's very difficult to find your room if Noone is around. Directions are extremely poor. I was there for 4 days and every time it took atleast 15 mins to reach lobby which was apparently only 4-5 mins away from my room. Beach and breakfast is mind blowing. "
4,"My husband and I truly enjoyed our stay at Grand Hyatt Bali. Every staff person we encountered was extremely friendly and gracious. We primarily ate at the Grand Hyatt club and the entire team  provided us with 5 star service, especially Ari. He knew our names and would always say hello when he saw us at the club . The wait staff at the club was equally amazing. Yuni was attentive and ensured that our drinks were refilled promptly. Although the hotel could use a fresh coat of paint and updates in some places, it was still beautiful. We loved the beach, which was always clean and not crowded. There is a path that connects the Hyatt with other hotels in the vicinity, which was great for morning strolls. We had an ocean view room and could catch the sunrise every morning. The room…"

5,"We loved our 8 days at the hotel! We had an ocean facing room, it was beautiful. The hotel is large and feels tranquil. I honestly didn’t want to leave it. We took beach walks. The beach is sandy clean and empty. I was mostly at hotel and my husband golfed nearby. Please more food options!! (I didn’t like the restaurants at the Collections, only the I Indian was food). I would come back if it wasn’t that far away (we live in Greece)!  The Spa was lovely, my husband had once though a rather average massage. My yoga class was great I wish I wasn’t that lazy and done more. Our son had a lovely nanny full time (Made Suciati- sorry for spelling), she came with us everywhere. Our son loved the pools. He is still too little for the kids club so can’t comment on that. Everyone was…"
4,"The Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua is a very large beachside resort.  All the usual beach activities are available and there are a number of huge pools to lounge around or play in.  I was very appreciative of the quiet adults only pool that was far away from the waterslide!   I stayed in one of the Club Suites and it was huge.  Large bedroom area, a walkthrough bath area with a glassed in double shower, living room and dining area.  All this opened onto a wrap around balcony overlooking the lily pond.  Pretty idyllic!  Breakfast, evening drinks and appetizers were all provided for compliments of the Club Lounge, so I didn't try any of the hotel's restaurants or bar.  Everything you need for a vacation is available on the property, so you almost don't have to leave.  However it would be…"
5,Wow was this service over the top. The entire Team Hyatt was excellent and courteous  throughout the entire complex. The numerous pools were massive and so cool to walk from the beach to the pool. They also had a very well equipped fitness center. The room and bathroom were gorgeous and housekeeping delivering fresh fruits everyday was a nice feature. It is convenient to walking to shopping and cute Bali Connection eateries and coffee bars.   
5," We visited this Hotel after purchasing a Luxury Escape, 8 night package which included Breki and Evening Meals and Sunset Cocktails. (The evening meals could be swapped for Lunch if desired.)  The Grand Hyatt Hotel is extensive. As such, its Balinese character is somewhat diluted because of its vast layout. None the less, it is however a beautiful Resort. The standard is set immediately on arrival. The eye catching Lobby Area and the Manicured Gardens look superb and very inviting.  The Hotel website claims there is 636 rooms located on 41Acres (16.6hectares) and 650m of beach front.  Rooms are located within 4 story spoke-wheel blocks in four separated Villages, all of which are located a considerable distance from the Lobby. We had requested a ground floor room. The upper…"

3,PROS: 1. Beautiful property: the hotel grounds are huge and very well maintained 2. The hotel has 2 water slides and 5 pools. Awesome! 3. Location is great. Hotel is located in a gated community and the area is well maintained. Great place to go for a walk/run 4. Staff is very polite and respectful.  CONS: 1. Ants in the closets. On our third day in we found probably 40-50 ants in our child's clothes and car seat 2. Beach HAZARDS on the property. Right next to the children's play area on the beach there was a piece of wood with a screw drive. Thru it laying screw side up in the sand. BIG SAFETY HAZARD. 3. Price of food is obscene and quality/flavor is so-so (you're better off getting GOJEK (Indonesia's Uber eats) and getting something delivered from across the road.) 4. Room…
5,"This hotel is one of most beautiful hotels we have ever stayed at.   Serene, peaceful and beautiful just like the staff who look after you so well without being overthetop      It suited us per perfectly as we wanted peace and quiet and a place to just chill and thats what we got.   Just gorgeous."

This hotel  does not disappoint , with  it's breathtaking gardens and huge swimming pools  ., with great surf .We relaxed on the beach most days as I love to surf and the local surfers are friendly  and the ocean with it's  crystal clean water with tropical fish amazing , also the staff are most helpful and make you feel relaxed with great beach side service and a warm welcome everyday  we felt so good and thank Suyasa for his friendly smile everyday  and great service..  The rooms are well appointed and fresh and  we had ocean view room  with the most wonderful views.

2,"I have stayed more than 50 nights at this hotel.  It has stunning gardens and usually top notch warm and personal service.  However on this occasion there are clearly some ageing issues.  The rooms are in desperate need of refurbishment - the curtains don't provide blackout and more importantly the air-conditioning in the hotel is basically broken.  It cools to a minimum 25 centigrade - not conducive to sleeping.  We told the hotel on the first day that the air-con in our room was not working and expected an engineer to fix it.  5 hours later, at 10pm, we returned to find nothing had been fixed.  We then spent the next 2 hours looking at 3 further rooms and all were the same.  We had a terrible night with severe lack of sleep.  The next day we wasted another 2-3 hours looking at…"
5,"Amazing ambiance, friendly staff, great food, very clean and well maintained, beaches are clean. Every element is well taken care of. I'd happily recommend this to anyone going to Bali fit for vacation. You'll love it :)"
4,"It’s a very beautiful resort with nice beach, the room is spacious and clean; love the Balinese feature pool but would love it even more if there are less ants or bugs around the poolside area, guess it’s hard to avoid but I believe some natural remedies can be done to minimise that."
5,Exotic and exciting hotel. We enjoyed the Indonesian food buffet dinners in front of local dance and fire shows.  Also the beach although shallow was perfect for our 3 year old grandson. I loved detoxing in the Indian Ocean and even enjoyed the five swimming pools and water slides .Drinks at the pool bar were fun too. I highly recommend this hotel!

5,"Wow! Having traveled extensively in Asia, I can truly say that the service provided at the Grand Hyatt Bali was comparable to a 5-star luxury hotel (Ritz Carlton, Shangri-La, et al). I would highly recommend the Grand Club to anyone seeking seamless service in a uniquely serene setting. I often read the negative Trip Advisor reviews on any property that we are travelling to in order to set my expectations regarding all manner of hotel experiences (quality of hard product, food & beverage selection, and service). Overall, we are low maintenance travelers, but our 11 year-old can be highly sensitive to surroundings as well as food & drink choices. The staff reduced our anxiety and accommodated our every request. If you are looking for a peace of mind getaway in beautiful…"
4,"Stayed here second time. First stay was 4 years ago.  Big compound, big room and overall nice but place is getting old and room a bit tired now.  Lots of amenities not in room but has to call them to get it which I find it troublesome.  Other than overall still a very good stay."
4,"We decided to stay here for a splurge as this kind of property is not our usual.  The welcome experience came with a gong bang, two classically dressed men playing a dulcimer like instrument, cold towels (absolutely necessary), and a drink.  The lobby is exceptional, with lotus flower ponds, a Lesser Heron strutting about and a general feeling of tropical calm and quality.  The hotel grounds were also quite extraordinary with lotus ponds, fish, ducks, large lizards, flowers, stone statues, Hindu ""altars"", swimming pools and a host of well acquainted restaurants.  There were alot of other aspects to the hotel that we didn't get around to visiting in our three short days.  We also got the feeling that this place is where Heads of State used to stay before more expensive properties…"
5,"We spent our family vacation in Grand Hyatt Bali in february 2019, and as always overall the resort is just a pure classic of Bali. We will definitely come back...  ++++ :  - The pool, one of the best you will ever see - The beach, amazing sand, deep blue water, big trees to rest when it's too hot (amazing how you will feel confortable and cool under the trees on the beach, so refreshing!) - The garden/flowers/nature around the hotel is magnificent. You will enjoy seeing birds, varan, fish, ducks, and plenty of squirrel playing around the place... - The food : Salsa Verde restaurant just near the beach is really great, and the breakfast are really nice too  - The Main Lobby : when you walk out the car the first day, you will see this INSANE lobby entrance : huge balinese style…"

5,"Spent 6 nights at Grand Hyatt with my family. Starting with the end: absolutely beautiful!

The smiles on all staff’ faces, from the car door on, their cordial attitude and the way they welcomed us relaxed the bad mood almost instantly.

3,"The Grand Hyatt Bali is the fallen star of the Hyatt family. Everything looks perfect on the surface with the cleanliness of the buildings and the gardens all being beautiful and definitely 6 stars, but when one peels back the surface to look inside the rooms you find a different world full of problems and when you complain and want to get things fixed you find an unsavoury undercurrent of denial in the staff, To give some examples, We asked at reception for 2 rooms one having a King bed and the other with 2 single beds. The receptionist  took some time and found rooms to our request. On entering the rooms to our surprise each room had a King bed. What happened afterwards was the real problem. My daughter asked 3 times every 20 minutes to have someone seperate the King bed into…"
3,"This is a lovely resort hotel. Very large complex of rooms set in beautiful surroundings. General service quality was high - with a few glitches that should not happen in a place of this sort. Rooms are very generously sized, and bathroom is spacious. When I arrived in room - there was no power. Took 3 calls to front desk to summon a maintenance man to flip the breaker. This is no big deal - but should not have taken 3 calls and 20+ minutes to get addressed. In conversations with other colleagues - several others had same issue upon arrival. This seems systemic and should not persist. It also took at least 5 minutes for warm water to arrive on shower tap. Normally, in the heat - I would not mind a cold shower, but the aircon in the room is so powerful that a hot shower is…"
5,"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 2 weeks. We were due to stay for just 1 week and when we moved into our next booked hotel, it simply wasn’t anywhere near the standard of the Hyatt, so we checked out and returned to the Hyatt!  From check in to check out - we were welcomed and made to feel very special. The rooms are excellent! Spacious and didn’t find them dated at all. The grounds are beautiful and really well cared for. Breakfast was excellent, staff really went the extra mile, for example the chap on the pancake counter, made different shaped pancakes for my 8 year old daughter every morning (she loved this).  Pools are huge and very relaxed - again, stunning!  The hotel is expensive. The Bali Collection is a shopping village a two min walk away - very expensive. Fine if your…"
5,Hotel and staff exceeded all expectations.  Grounds were beautiful with easy access to private beach. Food and amenities were great. Spa was an amazing experience.  Plenty of shopping and additional food choices next door in Bali Collection. Would highly recommend.  
5,"Stayed for a week and wish it could of been longer.  The hotel just oozes class with its stunning landscaped gardens and pools, the marble, tile and wooden beams in the open air Reception and its walkways leading to the different Hotel wings.  While the room itself is a little bit dated it was massive in size and the amenities provided top notch. Air conditioning was effective and quiet, and we found the king sized bed to be extremely comfortable and my wife reckons it gave her the best Hotel sleep experience she has had in years.

Everything looks perfect on the surface with the cleanliness of the buildings and the gardens all being beautiful and definitely 6 stars, but when one peels back the surface to look inside the rooms you find a different world full of problems and when you complain and want to get things fixed you find an unsavoury undercurrent of denial in the staff, To give some examples, We asked at reception for 2 rooms one having a King bed and the other with 2 single beds. The receptionist  took some time and found rooms to our request. On entering the rooms to our surprise each room had a King bed. What happened afterwards was the real problem. My daughter asked 3 times every 20 minutes to have someone seperate the King bed into…"
3,"This is a lovely resort hotel. Very large complex of rooms set in beautiful surroundings. General service quality was high - with a few glitches that should not happen in a place of this sort. Rooms are very generously sized, and bathroom is spacious. When I arrived in room - there was no power. Took 3 calls to front desk to summon a maintenance man to flip the breaker. This is no big deal - but should not have taken 3 calls and 20+ minutes to get addressed. In conversations with other colleagues - several others had same issue upon arrival. This seems systemic and should not persist. It also took at least 5 minutes for warm water to arrive on shower tap. Normally, in the heat - I would not mind a cold shower, but the aircon in the room is so powerful that a hot shower is…"
5,"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 2 weeks. We were due to stay for just 1 week and when we moved into our next booked hotel, it simply wasn’t anywhere near the standard of the Hyatt, so we checked out and returned to the Hyatt!  From check in to check out - we were welcomed and made to feel very special. The rooms are excellent! Spacious and didn’t find them dated at all. The grounds are beautiful and really well cared for. Breakfast was excellent, staff really went the extra mile, for example the chap on the pancake counter, made different shaped pancakes for my 8 year old daughter every morning (she loved this).  Pools are huge and very relaxed - again, stunning!  The hotel is expensive. The Bali Collection is a shopping village a two min walk away - very expensive. Fine if your…"
5,Hotel and staff exceeded all expectations.  Grounds were beautiful with easy access to private beach. Food and amenities were great. Spa was an amazing experience.  Plenty of shopping and additional food choices next door in Bali Collection. Would highly recommend.  
5,"Stayed for a week and wish it could of been longer.  The hotel just oozes class with its stunning landscaped gardens and pools, the marble, tile and wooden beams in the open air Reception and its walkways leading to the different Hotel wings.  While the room itself is a little bit dated it was massive in size and the amenities provided top notch. Air conditioning was effective and quiet, and we found the king sized bed to be extremely comfortable and my wife reckons it gave her the best Hotel sleep experience she has had in years.

5,"Second visit to this hotel - returned only because of the amazing customer service around the pool , beach and Grand Clube Pool by the pool staff and in particular Matsmita who is a real Ambassador for this hotel - however everything was spot on - Grand Club Service, Mr Urip and Mr Nurkholis - standout customer service in Grand Club, housekeeping spot on, clean , tidy - and no complaints - and great to see Matsmita still around the pool - will continue to return as long as these staff remain they are a true reason to visit - seriously go to this hotel - find these staff as described and enjoy your customer service experience!!!"
5,"This Hyatt is on stunning grounds, with beautiful lagoon pools and very secure. The direct beach access is very clean and the water very warm. The resort is very large yet there were no crowds and it was easy to access the pool and have plenty of space to relax. Our room was well appointed with a nice view out to the gardens and sea. The Club Lounge is large and staff are very friendly and polite. There is a different breakfast and evening food selection everyday with plenty of drinks.  Special thanks to Urip and Adi who made our stay memorable.  We spent 6 nights here and it was easy to organise a car and driver to explore the island.   The only suggestion is for the pool opening hours to be extended to open from 7am to 9pm rather than 8am to 7pm to allow for those how want to…"
5,"Club Rooms in need of update, but food, staff, and grounds were amazing, lots of wild life in this tropical paradise.  Special thanks to Urip and Sutrisna in the club lounge. we ate in most of the restaurants and we were not disappointed by any "
5,"This hotel is stunning , it’s gardens and surroundings are beautiful, the rooms are nice and well equipped. Breakfast was nice could have a good choice surrounded by beautiful gardens . Loads os sun beds never a problem . The only down side to staying here was it’s location as everything closed at 10 o’clock and there was nothing to do ."
4,"As you'd expect, this is a big, beautiful resort with immaculately maintained grounds and a great beach. However I felt a bit hostage by overpriced food/drink that was extreme even for this sort of property. Don't be fooled by reasonable room rates -- you'll make it up in basic food/drink (eg, nearly 6 USD for a can of local beer including 21% surcharge). Recommend buying a room package including breakfast or Club access in advance. Note the restaurants and stores within walking distance are pricey. When i tried to upgrade to Club access after check-in, the price was considerably more than what I could've arranged in advance. Also, this hotel desperately needs to work on sustainability. Please install fountains for refilling water bottles. There's way too much single-use plastic!"

4,"Just had 5 nights here. Really nice property. Impressive lobby and I had a huge room on the top floor.  It is very large and easy to get lost so it takes a few days to get your bearings. Staff were great.  Some reviews talk about it being tired but I didn't feel that. The design is Balinese with lots of timber and for me that is more appealing than all new concrete and glass. My friend was staying next door at Melia and my room in Grand Hyatt was superior to his.  The gardens are beautiful and well maintained. It's right on the beach, but it doesn't have a bar or restaurant overlooking the sea like Melia does. I think that's where Melia trumps.  I arranged a transfer from the airport, knowing I would pay a premium. But I was coming in late and didn't want the hassle. It cost…"
5,"We had eight days in a room with Club access - wife, 20 year old daughter and me.   The hotel is (I suspect) one of the older ones along this strip of the coast. I think this from conversations with staff who have been at the Hyatt for 25, 27, 28 years - which I reckon says something about them, their work and their employer. If you want to truly feel like a guest, rather than someone who is simply creating messes to be cleaned up or making work that has to be done ... COME HERE!! The staff are friendly, obliging, helpful - all wonderful people.   The hotel and its grounds seem to benefit from their age, not suffer. The pools are like none I have seen before - meandering streams covered by canopies of developed trees.   Our room was fine - plenty of space for the three of us.  …"

4,It’s welcoming feeling upon arrival at Grand Hyatt Bali. The sound of gong and Balinese musicians make us feel welcome. The sea view and natural green landscape were awesome.   We wish to convey our special thanks to two friendly and helpful customer service staff  Tita and  Kuriwada.   Our stay in Grand Hyatt Bali has been a very memorable one    
5,We stayed one night at this hotel and we loved it.it is a mistake that we didn’t stay more but it was an overnight stay when we arrived midnight to Bali we were going the next day to Nusa Lembongan.  Very good hotel for families where you can enjoy a kids slide and wonderful beach. The hotel is very big where you have restaurants and the best is the one close to the beach and they have very nice lobby where you relax. There are some shops inside the hotel but we didn’t get the chance to go to any shop because we checked in midnight and checked out midday.I recommend it if you are planning to be in a big hotel where you like to enjoy the nature and the luxury.
5,Grand Hyatt Bali is an amazing resort located on the best beach in Bali. The landscape territory is big and has plenty lush green. Our room was very clean and had great room service. The restaurants in the hotel are just amazing. Fresh sea food is served to you directly on the beach terrace with nice view.Staff members know English and are great at what they do. They always have a smile on and are very welcoming.  Can’t wait to come back here in Dec 2019!!
5,The best 5 star hotel We ever stayed in. Everything about the hotel-lobby rooms bathroom restaurants were luxurious. The family room was hugeand could comfortably accommodate 5 people  The garden area is breathtaking. The pool are is the biggest I have ever seen. The beach was good and clean. The location was great. Shopping centre and restaurants were across the road- 2 mins walk. Buffet breakfast was great with different varieties daily.the coffee lounge had a great view and we could sit there for hours. It had huge separate area for spa which was excellent .staff were really good. Overall we had a great experience
4,"We decided to try the GH on our 7th trip to Bali. We will definitely be back! The resort was stunning, the staff were lovely and the club package was well worth it. We have two young children and they had a ball. The club room was ideal - a day bed that sleeps two children and a king bed. Short walk to the club lounge and pool. Prior to booking I read all the reviews on trip advisor and was concerned about the mixed reviews. But it is honestly a fantastic option for young families. Several pools and restaurants to choose from, gorgeous kids club, small playground on the beach and for mum and dad, a stunning day spa! No need to leave the resort!"

5,"Visiting Bali is always pleasure to forget and escape from stressful life. Grand Hyatt Bali offers always great hyatt touch with perfect hospitality. Specialty highlighted Manager at Pasar Senggol Mr. Reka and Mr. Urip at Grand Club. Their hospitality, attention to details and friendships are really second to none. I will definitely visit again to meet them. Arigatou & Terima kasih！"
3,"I read many of the glowing reviews of this place before coming here. On arrival my initial reaction was one of disappointment. Yes, the landscape is beautiful, the pools are numerous, the staff are friendly and try their best but it’s not a “Grand” Hyatt; when the entire facility looks like it needs to be re-done to take this place into the 21st century.   I felt as though I’m was in a gilded cage, trapped in the sterility of Nusa Dua, a precinct that lacks character and fizz. We escaped to Seminyak!  It just isn’t for me.  "
4,"Nice and clean hotel within a secured compound. A 5 minutes walk to Bali Collection where you can find restaurants, bars and many shops (although prices are rather expensive).   Basic amenities in the hotel room could be improved.  We need to call the reception for toothbrushes, bedroom slippers etc and need to wait about 30 minutes before the stuff were delivered.    Facilities and beach are top class. Good spread for buffet breakfast.  "
4,"Located in Nusa Dua -- the classy, safe, manicured “Singapore of Bali” -- this timeless, sprawling family resort with its gorgeous mature flora and traditional design is virtually unrivaled in its category. Add to that shopping mall across the road, and you really can’t find a better match for young families and grandparents (others will probably prefer the more hip Seminyak). One valid issue many others have raised is charges for the kids club. I’d at least suggest the hotel offer guests a couple of hours complimentary entry to try before they buy.   We just just got back from a few days in a club room, which was very comfortable for our family of 4 (our young kids slept together in the made up day bed). Unfortunately, there were bed bugs. While I appreciate this is a challenge…"
5,"Stayed 20 years ago and even better today. The gardens are magnificent. You need to pay extra to access the club lounge as the food and beverage on offer is amazing. The Club Manager, and all his staff are exceptional."

3,Rooms are dated but functional. Gardens are spectacular. Being right on the beach was a plus. However the staff are polite but lack real personality. The only plus was that the kids loved the waterslide and plenty of pools to choose from. Disappointed that you couldn't get complimentary water when dining in the restaurants instead you had to buy water but yet they provided free bottle water in the rooms. We had items taken from our room when we changed rooms so please ensure you lock up your valuables. 
5,"We recently had 8 days at the Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua, staying in a Club Ocean View room. We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and it was a wonderful place to do that. The hotel is incredibly beautiful and the gardens are stunning and carefully maintained. The staff are the best thing about the resort - unfailingly friendly, professional and polite. We were delighted with our stay in the Club area and enjoyed the ability to have drinks and canapes there in the evenings. Salsa Verde is a great Italian restaurant and Ferry is a wonderful host there. I can't wait to go ack to this resort - it is incredible."
5," Upon arrival, we had a small problem which was resolved in a professional manner by the Hotel Manager, Amrit Gurung and Assistant Director of Rooms, Agus Virgianto. Since that, our stay has been more pleasurable by the day. The staff at the guest relations desk are always very helpful and nice. The room service was always on point.   We had the pleasure of meeting the Executive Chef, Greg Odolak. He took us on a tour of the various restaurants the resort has, which proved to be very helpful during our stay. After mentioning that we’re not big Japanese food lovers, he highly recommended the Nampu Japanese Restaurant and we took his advice. We were very impressed with the meals and service. He described the various cuisines of all the restaurants on offer. We dined at most of…"
4,"Overall we had a very relaxing and enjoyable stay and the resort was beautifully set out and very well equipped to suit people of all ages. Everything was clean and well maintained and there were a variety of activities to keep us occupied. At times I felt that the guest service was lacking, and would give that a rating of 3 out of 5. Whilst this may be a minor detail, I have stayed at other resorts in Bali where the concierge staff, restaurant staff and cleaners would go the extra mile to get to know their guests and make their stay as comfortable as possible, but I didn't feel that this was the case at the Grand Hyatt in Bali. Also, we stayed in a garden view room which had a lovely view, however we found it quite disrupting when birds would bang into our balcony window at…"
5,I just returned from a 14 night stay at the Grand Hyatt with my two children.  We had a wonderful holiday.  The hotel is set on beautiful gardens next to the beach and is very serene even though it is a very large resort.  We had a lot of fun in the swimming pools and sun lounges were readily available.We had breakfast included everyday and I could not fault it - amazing selection both at Salsa Verde and The Watercourt.  We ate dinner at Salsa Verde on a couple of occasions and enjoyed the Italian food on offer.  We also ate dinner at the Japanese restaurant and that was lovely.  The Courtyard Cafe was very disappointing and I could not eat my main course but they happily took it off the bill. There are many eating options at the local shopping mall called the Bali Collection.…

4,"Stunning grounds, gorgeous pools, right on a lovely beach, delicious food & charming staff. We spent 8 days on a luxury escapes package, which is a terrific deal that includes most meals, nightly cocktails and so much more! It’s big resort yet we saw no crowds, no hassling to get a poolside chair, all relaxed and easy. My only very very slightly negative comment is that the rooms, while spacious and extremely comfortable could do with a makeover.  Altogether a beautifully run and maintained resort! "
3,"It used be a great hotel in the past. I remember staying in this hotel years ago when I was kid. It was built in 1991 I guess. It was one of the luxurious hotels in Nusa Dua area during that time. I had a great experience and memory about this hotel as a kid.   Fast forward to 2019, the room and the property are old, need some renovations. This hotel is huge! You might get lost. Also, It’s very dark at night and a bit eerie..   Breakfast was alright. The pool is amazing.  there are new hotels nearby with the same price point.  Would be back here if the had a major renovations.   "
2,"If you want to pay high prices for a midrange cheap hotel, then stay here!  Very poor customer service didnt seem to know anything about the area when asked pointed questions. Did not enjoy the stay at all."
4,"Great resort, nice pools and restaurants with excellent location. I wish they offer  two-bedroom suites. The only option is a villa which is more expensive.The 2 twin bed room feel slightly crowded for a family of 4."

Our friends wanted to be on the 2nd floor & we wanted to be on the 1st floor (ground floor) & we requested views over water if possible. We both got what we wanted, close to each other too, no request was too much trouble. Would highly recommend this place to all my friends!The best 2 things is it's right on the beach & just across the road from the Bali Collection Shopping Mall with multiple shops & restaurants, best of both worlds !"
5,Stayed in a club room which gave access to the Grand Club.Our experience once checked in was first class.The Club staff were brilliant with nothing too much trouble. Always smiling and made you feel important.Our room was handy for the Club and easy to access. Breakfast was ideal and the evening ‘drinks and canapés ‘ were always varied and excellent.We enjoyed our stay.
5,"We chose the Grand Hyatt Bali from previously seeing it walking past on the the beach path 7 years ago.  We booked through the hotel website as World of Hyatt members and paid for our stay at the hotel.  The grounds are beautifully established and maintained, such a joy to walk around in.  The resident ducks offered us loads of entertainment when we were on the balcony.  We chose to spend most of our time on the beach at the front of our section of the resort as there were beautiful trees giving shade.  It is an older resort that has been there for a long time, but it is beautifully maintained and the gardens are outstanding.  Our room was a Grand Executive Suite King and we were not disappointed, everything was perfect. It was my birthday while we visiting and the hotel team…"
1,We have been to Nusa Dua many time though not to this hotel. This is our first luxury escapes holiday and thought we would go to a resort that is known for its high standard around the world. This particular Grand Hyatt is very dated - needing an upgrade. As a coupon holder we were made to feel inferior to the other guests. The food was pretty much the same menu for the coupon holders throughout the hotel. One night we could not get into any of the restaurants as the were all full ( hotel only half full though there was a conference on) when we did get served the food was very basic and average. Breakfast substandard for what I would expect at a hotel this level.  There are minimal/ zero activities organized for children outside the kids club ( which is well over priced compared…
4,"Hotel rooms are in need of renovation. Service throughout the hotel was very good. The grounds in the property are very charming and have the feeling of a Balinese garden. Beach at the hotel is not very good, however, the 5 pools are excellent."

5,"Ideal place to relax and pamper.  Beautiful surroundings the hotel grounds are spectacular and kept spotless and the beach was much better than in front of the other hotels and was kept clean. Food was great, as was the cocktails and Bali connection shopping mall is a close walk for other eating options."
5,"Hi grand Hyatt Bali,  i came to the veranda bar a few days ago for a some  drinks and i was in love with this beautiful place! this place is so magic en relaxing with the life music . i was served by a very nice lady ""Angela"" she had such a high level class serving me with a big smile ! the drinks and smoothies tasted perfect !  i will come back to this amazing place!  thank you Grand Hyatt Bali"
3,Stayed here for 6 long nights having booked for 8. We checked out early and let the hotel keep the cash.  Positives  Pool Rooms ok - spacious but dated bit musky  Staff pleasant in the main Close to Bali Collection  Negatives Breakfast not included for kids - this meant check in took 60 minutes while we cut a deal in US dollars  Pool water too warm Food not satisfactory  Needs new management and complete refresh  Seems to be mainly for conferences
4,"The Hotel service is superb with friendly staff everywhere you turn. We experienced the Grand Club during our stay & loved the food & beverage package that was supplied, with no dinner required as plenty of options available.Only down side is that the Hotel is showing its age& the rooms could do with a revamp compared to the competion."
5,"Stayed at hotel for a relaxing break.  Room had third bed instead of sleeping sofa which was perfect for daughter's ""private"" area.Used Hyatt points to stay at Grand Club level. Had excellent service checking in and out and with concierge assistance.  The breakfast, evening gathering, and all day refreshments were well worth the Club level upgrade. The private pool for Club level was a plus. All the meals at the various restaurants were excellent (although at typical hotel pricing). The sashimi at the Japanese restaurant was outstanding (order extra).  The ""Rendang"" pizza was a pleasant surprise of Indonesian flavor.The Hotel is far from the Kuta  area, but nearby shopping and restaurants offered alternative options. "

4,"The beach at Grand Hyatt Bali is truly stunning. The beach is clean and the staff super responsive. They have showers right at the beach, cocktails bar, towel service and they have a kids pool Our room had ocean front views"
4,"This hotel was very spacious, according the staff was built in 1991... around 14 HA, very spacious... Hotel has own private beach around 1 KM, very nice beach to spent time with family.... very large swimming pool, nice restaurant , western and japanese restaurant,  artistic ornament , lots of statues, spa corner and huge ballroom"
1,"This property is a shadow of it’s past glory days. Whilst kept with care over the years, it lacks the grandeur that made it Grand Hyatt In the past. This property needs to be knocked down and start from scratch to build a property worthy of its name. The layout is too confusing so much so that 2/5 staff couldn’t give accurate directions. The facilities to not cater for the number of patrons it holds, and signs of things starting to fall apart are starting to show everywhere. We stayed last year at the Grand Hyatt Cancun and these properties aren’t even in the same category let alone should wear the same name. "
5,"Grand Hyatt did not disappoint with our 2nd staff at this 5 star resort. What makes this resort a cut above the rest is the exceptional staff it employees - always friendly, always helpful, always polite and always professional!! No matter where you are at this resort when you pass a staff member you are greeted with a smile and a hello and to me and my family there is no better way to be welcomed and appreciated!! Thank you!! The resort is just beautiful, the food plentiful, the pools relaxing and the beach clean - honestly it feels like paradise. Another bonus to this resort is that you are 5 mins from Bali collection where you can pick up souvenirs to take home to family and friends. Could not recommend this resort highly enough!!

The location, staff were excellent and a very relaxed experience which all our family are looking forward to going back to."
1,"Hello! We arrived at Grand Hyatt on Jan 5th 2019 and were amazed by the beautiful territory. The hotel was looking great and staff was pretty friendly which is also very important. Everything was quite good until morning 6th of Jan when we went for a breakfast at Watercourt restaurant. The variety of food was’t very big btw, however it was Ok as have quite a simple requirements. The problem appeared when my pregnant (!!!) wife took a portion of sliced chicken (as usually she eats it and my 2.5 years daughter as well) and after she started eating that she realized that chicken is completely rotten. Absolutely 100%. What an unexpected surprise in a 5 star hotel. She called for a personnel and they did replaced a chicken on a table, however nobody said how sorry do they feel and…"
5,This was not our first stay. They never failed to surprise us with little touches to indicate that they value our custom. This time round we were astounded by the presence of a score board in our room for our annnual SCRABBLE CHALLENGE! WOW!

5,"A really nice hotel for the entire family. There are lots of walkways, beautiful gardens, multiple swimming pools, lots of ponds etc that will keep the kids entertained. Rooms are large with an extra bed that can sleep two small kids. Hotel is slightly old, but maintained well. Staff is very friendly and the buffet breakfast is very good. I have been coming back to this hotel year after year when I come to Bali. Bali Collection is just across the street and therefore you can shop and eat till late night and cross the road and come back. The beach is very clean and private. Almost every guest gets lost inside the hotel due to its vastness and that's enjoyable sometimes. WaterBlow at Nusa Dua is 15min walk from hotel."
5,The hotel and staff were amazing Will go back there again Food is great Location is great Bali collections 3 min walk Will see u soon grand Hyatt Thank u for lovely memories Best hotel in Bali The day spa is amazing
5,"The main reason I picked this resort was the beach and it did not disappoint! It was huge and was so interesting to sit and watch the water. The location is unique as it is by a peninsula called the Water Blow which provided hours of entertainment just watching the waves hit it. The beach is private up to the tide line and staff makes sure it stays that way. The restaurants were very good, a little pricey compared to the options across the street at the Bali Collection so if you can add on meals it is worth it - especially breakfast. The pool was the best one I have ever seen at a resort. You felt like you were swimming in the jungle. The rooms were big and very nice. Ensuite bathrooms were a little open so there is privacy but could be a little uncomfortable for some. The…"
5,Excellent hotel. Staff were very friendly and accommodating.  The gardens are immaculate. Pool area was perfect as well as water temperature. Loved the beach out the front. The hotel is in the centre of all the big resorts in Nusa Dua. The restaurants catering to every need. Would recommend this hotel and will be staying here again in the next year.
5,We stayed for 3 nights. Good size of swimming pool with slides. Everyone including kids and grown ups can enjoy. Spa experience was totally amazing. Good gym facility as well. Friendly staff. Definitely recommended.

4,The hotel is of excellent condition with fantastic pools and beautiful ocean views. Unfortunately our beds were very hard and felt like sleeping on boards. The kids had a ball and we dozed on pool chairs. Restaurants excellent food but prices high.
1,Grand Hyatt Bali should not be booked with the brand in mind as it’s not like any standard Grand Hyatt properties but much below standard. The hotel is worn out the staff are ill informed and reclusive.
4,The Grand Hyatt Bali is situated in a beautiful area called Nusa Dua. Beaches are sandy and gardens are beautiful. The 3.5km Nusa Dua beach strip is covered with 5 star hotels which offer plenty of water sports. Hotel is situated in a high security area which makes jogging a pleasure. 
5,"The Grand Hyatt in Bali is a huge resort on the beach. Beautiful, with excellent food choices and great staff. Perfect for relaxing and escaping the busy life of big cities. Location is Nusa Dua, which is the “resort” area, so there is not too much right outside of the hotel except for a big mall with average-quality restaurants and lots of souvenir shops, but it’s easy to spend time at the Hyatt in its many facilities and enjoy the experience.There is one loud club not far from the Hyatt that can make it hard to sleep unfortunately, depending on where your room is located. It ruins the atmosphere of tranquility but I guess there’s not much they can do for it."
1,"Checked in and back out within an hour, room quality is tired 3 star at best. The lagoon outside our room was full of floating dead fish and plastic water bottles. TV didn’t work, half a used bog roll left in the pan and after making a pretty reasonable complaint an absolute refusal to make any kind of room upgrade. Hopeless service standards from the management."

5,"I thougth I already had stayed at the best hotel ever. I was wrong. Grand Hyatt must be as close to heaven one can get. The hotel area is huge and very well kept, It is like staying in a huge Balinese botanical garden. All rooms either have seaview or a nice gardenview. All the staff is very polite and friendly, some of them even know, and adress you by, your name 🙂 Two pool areas with plenty of sunbeds, but after 11 am it can get a little bit crowded. Lot of families with small children so it is not quiet around the pool... Advisable to book a room with breakfast (3 different restaurantes to choose between) since this is a 5-star hotel, with a 5-star price level. Excellent Italian restaurant onsite, but if you find the 4 different onsite restaurantes to expencive, there are…"
5,"Spent 6 nights at the hotel just before Christmas. A big hotel but spread out over a large beautifully landscaped site with lots to explore, several pools and a wonderful beach. Good sized room with huge comfortable bed and the day bed in an alcove converted to a double sized bed so room can easily sleep 2 adults and 2 children. Good breakfasts with slight variations everyday but expensive if you're not on a meal plan.  Loads of sun loungers by the pools and on the beach so never any problem finding anywhere to sit. Some evenings ate at restaurants in the Bali Collection Mall across the road but  the Italian restaurant at the hotel is very good and not too expensive. Staff very courteous and welcoming. Didn't get a chance to try the spa but hope to next time!!"
3,We were somewhat disappointed.  The property is spectacular and in a great location but worn and in need of an upgrade.  Service was slow and the staff was just not as hospitable as other places in Bali we visited.
4,Grand Hyatt is a good property at good location (right next to Bali collection Nusa Dua). Overall we had good time but service was disappointing. If you are sports loving family or individual be ready to shell out more money to use Tennis court. Table Tennis table is of very bad quality. If you are using your Hyatt Club points be aware breakfast is not included with your room booking.Overall Very Good property! 8 out of 10!
1,Presence of mould in room is a major oversight from management. We had kids and could not believe that management would still let the room be occupied. Outdated hotel condition was also a huge damper on our vacation. We had to mov

Pools and beach are kept in excellent condition. All pool, gardening and food service staff work very hard.  My wife had an accidental fall near lobby due to wet floor. Duty manager offered medical care which helped my wife with some pain relief. Fortunately she wasn't injured deeply, just need ice packs snd lots of rest.  Hotel is little run-down with age. Restaurant food quality (Salas Verde, Garden Cafe and Nampu) were below average, so strongly recommend to dine elsewhere for special occasions. Bali Collection is very near but all places are not much better or cheaper.  Best value for money was Bumbu…"
5,"Had the best Christmas in Bali. The resort is stunning. The staff are lovely. There was plenty of options for breakfast,lunch and dinner. Great food and resort. Spent a day out and about in ubud, visiting the monkey forest, Balinese show and lunch over the water.Will definitely be returning."
5,We stayed here for five nights with three teenagers and thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We stayed near the garden water palace restaurant where we had breakfast every day as it was 1 minute walk away. We enjoyed it there as there was a great selection of food it beautiful surroundings. The beach is very large with plenty of sun beds where you can get shade from the trees and waiters constantly serving for drinks. A special mention to Parnata who knew exactly what time to bring the beer buckets with snacks. There are five pools and the hotel is very large which can be not to every one’s liking but we felt that it still had that personal touch. The hotel was quite expensive but there were restaurants up from the beach where you can can get cheaper meals or outside the main…
2,"My arrival service was nice and pleasant. Well until i entered my room and i felt sick all of sudden which made me wanted to drink warm water, right away and im bringing my baby with me and he needs to drink his formula. Surprisingly, the kettle they provided inside our room was rusty and i felt disgusted. I was thinking maybe they forgot to change it with the new one. So i called the housekeeping to provide me with the new one. I waited for like 25 mins but no one came to my room, so ive decided to called the housekeeping again and their answer was 'oh maybe we haven't find it.' Then i waited again for another 20 mins until finally, they bring the kettle to me.  The next day, after i took a shower for the second time, i was shocked and i just realized that they didnt even…"
5,"Super resort - pool, beach, restaurants - all top notch.  The breakfast buffet at the Grand Club Lounge was a great way to start each day.  I mailed 30+ postcards with stamps attached.  When my postcards reached the US, I noticed that an additional 2500 IDR stamp had been attached to my cards.  Many thanks to the Concierge Desk for covering my additional postage and ensuring my Bali postcards were successfully delivered!"

5,We stayed here for five nights with three teenagers and thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We stayed near the garden water palace restaurant where we had breakfast every day as it was 1 minute walk away. We enjoyed it there as there was a great selection of food it beautiful surroundings. The beach is very large with plenty of sun beds where you can get shade from the trees and waiters constantly serving for drinks. A special mention to Parnata who knew exactly what time to bring the beer buckets with snacks. There are five pools and the hotel is very large which can be not to every one’s liking but we felt that it still had that personal touch. The hotel was quite expensive but there were restaurants up from the beach where you can can get cheaper meals or outside the main…
2,"My arrival service was nice and pleasant. Well until i entered my room and i felt sick all of sudden which made me wanted to drink warm water, right away and im bringing my baby with me and he needs to drink his formula. Surprisingly, the kettle they provided inside our room was rusty and i felt disgusted. I was thinking maybe they forgot to change it with the new one. So i called the housekeeping to provide me with the new one. I waited for like 25 mins but no one came to my room, so ive decided to called the housekeeping again and their answer was 'oh maybe we haven't find it.' Then i waited again for another 20 mins until finally, they bring the kettle to me.  The next day, after i took a shower for the second time, i was shocked and i just realized that they didnt even…"
5,"Super resort - pool, beach, restaurants - all top notch.  The breakfast buffet at the Grand Club Lounge was a great way to start each day.  I mailed 30+ postcards with stamps attached.  When my postcards reached the US, I noticed that an additional 2500 IDR stamp had been attached to my cards.  Many thanks to the Concierge Desk for covering my additional postage and ensuring my Bali postcards were successfully delivered!"
5,"Our second trip, and it was lovely to be back again. So many of the staff remain, in fact, nearly all. They remembered our last visit and welcomed us back. Urip, Norman, Ary, Ari, Wiji, Yani, Sutrisna provided excellent personalised service throughout. A big thank you to all at the Grand Club. You are a credit to your profession and the hotel is lucky to have you. Given there are so many excellent luxury hotels in the vicinity this hotel distinguishes itself with its staff and the property.  The Kids Centre staff are fantastic as well. Children will WANT to go back to the Kid's Centre, it is fun. It does charge, but reasonable, and it is worth it, given the activities and also lunch/dinner provided, if necessary, in a lovely and secure setting, with their own garden, out-door…"
4,Extensive garden setting with well designed swimming pools as well many decorative ponds. Several on site restaurants and bars offer variety. Large beach with plenty of deck chairs and trees providing shade. Grand lobby and several buildings spread over complex. Some of the buildings clearly show signs of aging and are in need of renovation. Easy access just across the road to  a large pedestrian only shopping and restaurant area in park like environment
5,"We stayed at Grand Hyatt Bali during the last 2 days of our honeymoon and we loved it. Great hotel, really big. Nusa Dua is a very safe and calm area with lots of resort hotels around.  We stayed at the club room and they upgraded us because it was our honeymoon, thanks for this! The club lounge was great and the staff were very friendly. Recommended for a calm, relaxing stay at Nusa Dua in Bali! "
5,"We are currently staying at this lovely resort after 6 nights in Seminyak which we loved,  so doing a combo of hustle bustle rhen total calm at relaxation here at the Hyatt has been perfect.  The resort seems low occupancy at the moment so lots of space and quiet areas to enjoy.  We have a Club Room and must commend all the Lounge Staff who have been amazing... Lead by Urip,  Adi and thank you Yuni for looking after us so well. The nightly drinks and food is fantastic and a must ! We are a little disappointed however at the lack of management or GM presence.  Having just come from the Trans in Seminyak where the GM knows personally his guests and is out and about Constantly chatting his guests it is noticeable here and is non existent. My daughter and I got lost on one side of…"
5,"We stayed 2 nights for a short family break and found the Grand Hyatt absolutely perfect. The staff were great, rooms big and comfortable and the grounds are stunning. We were very pleasantly surprised that the food was excellent and the portions much bigger than other hotels in Nusa Dua. Very impressed! It's a long walk around the resort but because it's so beautiful we didn't mind at all. "

4,"I have stayed with Grand Hyatt at many places but this one disappointed me. The size of the room and bathroom are quiet small compared to other Grant Hyatt’s. You feel the interiors are outdated and bit worn out. If you leave aside the room, the property is worth visiting. It’s maintained very well with all amenities and facilities. It has a clean and quiet beach and some amazing restaurants and shopping areas inside the hotel. The location is also good with a shopping complex and lots of cafes and restaurants just opposite the property entrance. If you are on a family vacation or a laid back trip then this property is good to visit. "
5,"A true Bali experience from check in  to check out.Staff from Check in, Restaurants, Pool, Spa, waitresses/waiters   could not do enough for you...great restaurants, gardens and surrounds. Rooms serviced multiple times daily. Great location in Nusa Dua Bali on the beach. Many alternate restaurants within walking distance. "
5,My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt Bali after an extensive tour of Vietnam and Cambodia. We especially wanted to have some relaxation and down time away from the crowds. We were not disappointed and were especially glad to have signed up for the Grand Club.
4,"Had an enjoyable 3 nights here, didnt even get to discover all of the property as we were busy touring the Island.  Hotel staff very pleasant and courteous and go that extra mile.  I had an eye problem coming off the cruise ship and notified the hotel that I needed to check in early and see a doctor.  They arranged everything for me.  Upon arrival they escorted me to the doctor, even sent a floral bouquet to my roomwishing me well. These extra touches makes the hotel a true gem."
5,"Just arrived back from a 2 week stay at Grand Hyatt Bali - What an incredible place!  First impressions when we pulled into the hotel were very good - the concierge knew our names before we left the taxi and were treated to a ""welcome gong"". The entrance is simply stunning with views of the koi ponds overlooking the gardens and then the ocean. The whole resort is spotless, the staff must work so hard to keep the place in such good shape because it is enormous.  The pools are very clean, witnessed staff cleaning the pool while we were there. The beach is pretty good, the sand is soft and fluffy (only downside is the amount of debris floating in the sea, but this is uncontrollable by the hotel).  The food is always delicious, well presented and well prepared with a good choice at…"

1,we visited a restaurant in this hotel for dinner. we waited very long for our food. when food came they gave the wrong food and they did not apologize for their mistakes. and when we left they chased us over charges that we hadn't paid. very disappointing.
3,"This is my 2nd visit at Grand hyatt. We’ve been to bali many time. But we’ve stay at different hotel depending on the area visited. This time we chose Nusa Dua to avoid the crowd in Kuta or Seminyak. Definitely we chose Grand Hyatt. Cause of the ambience, and spacious room. But i found that they did not serve fresh juice during breakfast time at their venues. It’s shame, normally 5 star hotels serve fresh juice during breakfast time. I believe they should improve on the quality. "
4,"Checked in here after leaving our AirBnB which was full of bugs and was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful grounds and overall resort.  Staff was friendly and accommodated us after our “Ocean View” was not really an “Ocean View”; it had more of a “peek-a-boo” around the wall view.  They quickly changed us and we enjoyed the rest of our stay here.  The breakfast was fantastic and plentiful.  The pool was standard yet well located in between a restaurant and the ocean.  This area of the island is a bit tucked away and situated in a resort area where you can walk to the Bali Collection (outdoor mall with restaurants and shops) but not much other than seclusion.  If you’re picturing this resort to have the local amenities and culture of Ubud, then we wouldn’t recommend staying in…"
3,"It is a beautiful property, but am disappointed in a couple of things: 1.  Made a reservation with Guest Relations for a dinner and show on the property at approximately 9:00 AM.  Received a call from Guest Relations that the dinner and show were fully booked, thus can not utilize this reservation.  Not very sympathetic, even though I have Globalist Tier level it is obvious we were bumped by a favorite of the hotel.  2. Lack of monitoring the noise level of guests - room above our suite was noisy until 3:00 AM including loud talking on the balcony.  Most Hyatt’s I have stayed at, around the world from Milan to London to Dubai (and all over the USA) enforce a quiet time where the noise must be confined to your room.  Again, beautiful property and nice people but getting bumped…"
5,"If you are a paradise on earth seeker then you must visit Grand Hyatt Bali. Nestled at the beach front of Nusa Dua, one of the most fancy area in Bali with a beautiful beach. The resort has hundreds of rooms and the most thing you need to anticipate is the Pool area. It was like a tropical paradise on earth! Love the way they designed the pool like it is a natural beautiful lagoon. Speak about the foods, they have couple of restaurants with numbers of menu from Indonesian, Japanese, to Italian cuisines. You should try the Pasar Senggol Night Market where you can experience an outdoor buffet dinner while enjoying the performance of Kecak Dance. Totally recommended for family occasion."

5,"My Wife and I spent a week at the grand hyatt resort and visited the restaurant most days. The food was fantastic, the drinks where nice and cold and the view was amazing. The staff were also amazing, I would like to give a special thanks to Trisna she was great, couldnt do enough for us."
5,"Recently returned from a second holiday in this amazing place. The hotel is situated on the beach, amongst the most manicured gardens, trees and pools. It is beautifully clean and has all the amenities one could ask for to make a truly relaxing and indulging holiday. The rooms are large with huge beds, clean and comfortable with daily service to an exceptional standard. The hotel offers many eating venues, catering for all palettes, all set in the most beautiful of surroundings. I can highly recommend the afternoon tea at Veranda lounge and bar, an array of sandwiches and cakes, all beautifully presented by very attentive staff whom want you to thoroughly enjoy the experience! The Garden Cafe, offers a wide choice of food, but the fish and chips are amazing and very plentiful!…"
5,"Located right on Nusa Dua beach, amazing for families.  Our kids loved the kids club and activities.  We loved the spa and highly recommend their authentic Japanese restaurant.  Great pizzas at Salsa Verde too.  "
5,"We spent 2 nights here in Nov 2018. The resort is enormous - walking from one end to the other is quite the effort. The grounds are lush and beautifully maintained, with relaxing, undulating landscaping reminiscent of an old temple.  Our room was spacious with a huge day bed and terrace overlooking a pond teeming with fish. Service is exceptionally polite and courteous. The TVs are a tad dated and lack usb/hdmi input.   The beach here is quite clean and is great for a long walk. The pool looks a little dated but is large (it twists and turns along the beachfront and is well placed within the landscaping). It provides plenty of room for sunlounges and is ideal for a leisurely wander / swim. They have two waterslides - one for little kids and another for big kids.  Although we we…"

Right from check in by Sarli, to being shown to the room by Christine, to coffee shop staff Rina, Sri, Krista ( I hope I got the name right and others...sorry and please forgive as I cannot remember all the names of your excellent staff) we were treated like royalty. My husband and I had a beautiful time as always. We will def visit again and again. The room was beautiful and the beach is immaculately kept. We tried lthe Japanese restaurant and it was amazing. Thank you for taking such good care of us. "
5,Great location of this property. It is located close to the beach and there are lots of food outlets and other activities to choose from  around the property. Good pool to relax. Great service and overall value for money.
3,I stayed at this hotel for over a week. The staff are friendly and the rooms are absolutely superb.  Food was great but breakfast I found to be quite pricy.  on several occasions in the early morning I was woken up due to noisy toddlers being left on the balconies to keep themselves occupied. I realize this is to no fault of the Hotel but management might want to consider issuing notes to these inconsiderate guests.  I would still recommend this hotel but make sure you book a room in a quiet section...
5,"This is my 2nd time here, it’s relaxing, food is fantastic and service is great. Thank you to the staff. Rooms getting a little tired, but very clean and little touches like fresh fruit and cookie jars are nice."

I had to book an extra night for the room the customer service who answers emails were very good at answering my emails , very prompt and they always had an answer to my queries . I checked out then property and it looked very nice in the website but when we got to the resort the rooms were very disappointing. It’s old and the closet smells and the bathroom had molds in the grouts. The room is very spacious but needs renovation. Also since it’s a big resort we got lost several times because there weren’t enough directional signs ! And at around 6 pm the corridors are very dark! This is a beautiful property I wish it was maintained properly. Not worthy of the GRAND hyatt name! The staff…"
5,"I’m a loyal Hyatt member and have been to dozens of Hyatt’s.  This Hyatt is at the top of my list from the helpful/friendly staff to the dining options on site.  Location wise, very close to the beautiful Bali National golf course and many shops and restaurants within walking distance.  Will definitely stay at the Hyatt every time I visit Bali!"
2,"Sadly the food which is a Hyatt signature is missed here as breakfast was a series of ‘hit & miss’ with more misses like soggy bland bacon tasting like wet cardboard. It’s a real downer when you can’t do a great breakfast with a captive audience. Being here on a hotel design related conference, it’s disappointing to be here with such poor food as both lunch and dinner didn’t fare better. Lastly the room product is dated and way finding was terrible. All in all, not a great experience and missing the Hyatt touch!!!"

5,"Had a fantastic stay at Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua, Bali.  Stayed in 1 king bed room. Quite spacious with private balcony overlooking the garden area. It also had a day bed at othe end of the room, on a slightly raised platform.  Awsome breakfast spread. Had few meals apart from buffet breakfast, and it was great.  It also had a private beach. Big and well maintained.  The entire property feels like a huge garden which gives and awsome experience. "
4,"I was here for a company convention. Perfect organization for the business days in terms of meeting rooms, services and logistic. This is a quite big hotel with excellent facilities like pools and Spa.  Rooms are large and very comfortable. Breakfast buffet is various and high quality. Staff is very friendly and attentive to the customer needs."
4,"The hotel is very nice with an amazing garden and pool areas. We stayed in a club room, the room was a bit dated but spacious. There were several restaurants to choose from. The Club lounge breakfast and the evening drinks with canapés were really nice. Service all around the hotel,from Club Lounge to pool side was very good.Location is excellent with walking distance to Bali Collection and to other restaurants and only 20 min from Denpansar Airport.The beach was clean and had a nice walking path in both directions. Would definitely recommend Grand Hyatt for a relaxing vacation in Bali."
5,"The Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua is a great family hotel. Nusa Dua appears to be a secure gated community with a large number of 5 star hotels. The Grand Hyatt is on the beach and offers a great view. The rooms are good and our son really liked the childrens bed. The restaurants offered a good choice of quality food as well as you having the option to walk to the Bali collection for more food options and shopping. Some souvenir items were even made while yoy watched in the Grand Hyatt. Not the cheapest of Bali holidays, but if you want a luxury holiday it is a great option. The only downside was nog getting a late checkout and having an evening flight. "
5,"I enjoyed the pools, there are many pools in whole resort area. the main canal pools are fun, Hyatt did a great job plant garden around it. I also walked to some quieter block of the hotel and try their Balinese pool. It was beautiful.   In April the beach was wavy, I didn't see any guest are in the sea water. Again, this might change in different season. A lot of beach chairs, and trees around, so we had a good nap on the beach. There are many sales women on the beach, I understand they work hard to earn a living. But they sometimes don't accept no as an answer.  Resort was really huge, you can easily spend a whole day inside. Right next door is ""Bali collection"", a grand shopping area, western style, clean, safe, not as cheap as local small vendors, but you really get…"

Staff is very friendly and attentive to the customer needs."
4,"The hotel is very nice with an amazing garden and pool areas. We stayed in a club room, the room was a bit dated but spacious. There were several restaurants to choose from. The Club lounge breakfast and the evening drinks with canapés were really nice. Service all around the hotel,from Club Lounge to pool side was very good.Location is excellent with walking distance to Bali Collection and to other restaurants and only 20 min from Denpansar Airport.The beach was clean and had a nice walking path in both directions. Would definitely recommend Grand Hyatt for a relaxing vacation in Bali."
5,"The Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua is a great family hotel. Nusa Dua appears to be a secure gated community with a large number of 5 star hotels. The Grand Hyatt is on the beach and offers a great view. The rooms are good and our son really liked the childrens bed. The restaurants offered a good choice of quality food as well as you having the option to walk to the Bali collection for more food options and shopping. Some souvenir items were even made while yoy watched in the Grand Hyatt. Not the cheapest of Bali holidays, but if you want a luxury holiday it is a great option. The only downside was nog getting a late checkout and having an evening flight. "
5,"I enjoyed the pools, there are many pools in whole resort area. the main canal pools are fun, Hyatt did a great job plant garden around it. I also walked to some quieter block of the hotel and try their Balinese pool. It was beautiful.   In April the beach was wavy, I didn't see any guest are in the sea water. Again, this might change in different season. A lot of beach chairs, and trees around, so we had a good nap on the beach. There are many sales women on the beach, I understand they work hard to earn a living. But they sometimes don't accept no as an answer.  Resort was really huge, you can easily spend a whole day inside. Right next door is ""Bali collection"", a grand shopping area, western style, clean, safe, not as cheap as local small vendors, but you really get…"
5,"We traveled with our family of four in October. From the moment we arrived we felt relaxed, and safe. This hotel is stunning. The grounds are massive!! With its own shopping village! We stayed in a Garden view room, it was clean, the bed was super comfy and the day bed was plenty big enough for our 2 children. Kids club every day was a treat, the kids begged to go every day! The water slide and pool set up was ultimate for family’s. Majority of guests were young families and older couples, all very friendly. Salsa Verde was delisious , we are there 5 nights for dinner! We cannot wait to come back!"
5,"This hotel is simply jaw-dropping gorgeous. The scenery, the staff, the food, everything was just perfect. You can't help but to be mesmerized with its architecture, the landscaping, the lotus flower lakes swarmed with koi fish, the bridges, the vegetation. Every corner oozes a deep sense of calm and tranquility; photos don't do justice to the beauty of this place. Unfortunately I was here for work this time, but I would definitely love to come back with my husband and kids. 2000% recommended!"
4,"Seems to have lost much of what it stood for , a time of peace ,quiet and Bali charm ... The Island of the Gods once great hotel needs a reminder of what made it so great. Some of the improvements are just average , the noise from a new function Centre next door is horrible .. "
2,"The hotel grounds are beautiful, like most of the resorts in the area. However, the beach was a huge disappointment: it's not the paradise that it appears to be in the pictures. If you're looking for a good beach (the kind you would expect to encounter in Bali), I recommend staying in other resorts, like Sofitel and Laguna.   Also, soon after checking in (in the evening), I found that there was hair in the bath tub and wash basin. I asked to be moved to another room, and they put me in a smaller one. I thought this was very disrespectful to a Hyatt member, but  I bit the bullet, as I was too tired and jet lagged to complain further. Besides, I was excited about going to the beach the next day... which turned out to be extremely disappointing, as described above.  I thought I'd…"
5,"This is a beautiful and well managed hotel in central Nusa Dua with all the services you would expect from a premier hotel. The campus is large, but not bigger than you can easily navigate the compound on your own. We stayed here during the IMF and World Bank annual meetings and had the benefit of comparing and contrasting with the other resorts. This is definitely one of the better ones in Nusa Dua and the surrounding area."

2,we stayed 3 nights. on the first day I stayed in a sofa room and my bathroom still smelled bad. I called to the front office but after that there was no one in my room. I am very disappointed and I will not return to this hotel
1,"Beautiful grounds and lovely staff on the ground but this hotel is sadly let down by their management. There was a misunderstanding in relation to our booking. Sadly management were determined to put all the blame on us regardless of the evidence to the contrary, we presented. What we saw was a big hotel that has forgotten about the customer. I would be careful about this hotel because if you have any complaints or anything goes wrong during your stay, they are unlikely to take anything on board or  try to assist with the problem. They are more likely to try to put the blame on you or make excuses. I feel sad for the staff on the ground because they are amazing but their management needs some serious training in customer service."
2,"This hotel is perfect, the staff are very attentive and the grounds are immaculate and would normally deserve a 5 rating,  however whilst we were there the International Monetary Fund annual conference began and we felt as though we were second class citizens we were expected to wear ID cards or carry our passport with us, we could not be picked up from the hotel for trips etc we were ferried to a dusty filthy car park and had to wait there, the staff had face masks in this car park but we as paying guests had to breath in the dust and fumes of literally 100s of mopeds.  We paid extra for a front facing ocean room which is what we got accept the last 4 days we were looking at a great big battleship, this experience really tainted what had begun as an idyllic holiday."
4,Was badly injured to un maintainced pool which was very badly chipped tile but the buffet breakfast was decent size and very nice we also add to be upgraded to junior suite as first was very dirty and smelt like cigarettes inside
3,"Great location with private beach yet the property is old.  The food menu is also with limited choices and the taste is just average.  Overall, if they offer you a good price / value.  But if you want some true nice resort experience in Bali, this may not be the top choice"

5,"This resort is in Nusa Dua, great location on the beach in a gated community of resorts. Much quieter than the hustle and bustle of Kuta etc... Next to Bali Galleria open shopping mall. Clean and well maintained huge complex. Rooms are just getting a little dated but they are spacious and well laid out. Huge pool area. Recommend for families or couples."
5,Great ambience in the hotel with well maintained gardens and pools. Staff were Very polite and caring. Rooms are old but it goes with the age of the hotel. We loved staying at this place and great fun for kids. 
3,"Stayed at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua at the end of our holiday.... hoping the best stay to end our trip in Bali. But.... i think Hyatt is not 5 stars anymore, maybe it was 5-10 years a go, but not today. I arrived at 4 pm, check in was quite fast.. it only took 15 minutes to get our room. I’m quite impressed when we entered our room, they already prepared everything for my baby. But unfortunately the floor still dirty with sand, so we need to call the cleaning service... but again... the phone was offline, so we have to go down to lobby to call the cleaning service.  The AC also not cool enough.. so we need to call technician to fixed it. Thank you for the technician, the AC works well after they fixed it. Most of the staff were nice and helpful, but some looks no smile and old... …"
5,"Stayed 3 nights in a club room. We were blown away by the exceptional service by staff in the Grand Club.  We celebrated our wedding anniversary and were presented with a beautiful cake and 2 flower arrangements. Wish we had stayed longer to enjoy them!  The hotel is massive but so well maintained. Gardens are gorgeous. Restaurants were well price and the food was fabulous. Best nasi goreng I’ve ever eaten. I want it now!!  We stayed in Tanjung Benoa at the Sakala for 8 nights before our stay at Grand Hyatt and the Grand Hyatt hands down represented better value for food and drinks. Our room was comfortable and the day bed was perfect for our 9yr old to sleep on.  Wish we had stayed longer and are already planning on returning.  We really loved the  Grand club ammenities,…"
4,A few days in Bali prior to diving safari in Lombok. Hyatt was as expected high end with all the luxuries. Great site and beach front. Fantastic resort ammenities. Food was delicious and menu was sufficiently differ and lengthy to cater for a longish stay.

4,Very nice resort particularly suitable for family vacation. The rooms are very designed for staying with small kids and have good recreation arrangements particularly kids pool and also like the evening sereny environment at the resort
5,"We’re just checking out of the Grand Hyatt after 8 nights here, and it’s been perfect.   We’ve worked out for us to split our breaks in Bali into an initial week of quiet relax in the south of Bali and then a second week on the west coast, somewhere with a bit more bustle like Seminyak. This first week has been one of the best to just get back to health and we’ll being.   I almost overlooked the Grand Hyatt in Nusa as it’s one the oldest hotels and I made an assumption it could be tired. The tropical weather here affects building materials and I just thought the rooms would be worn. I was so wrong, the Grand Hyatt is an excellently maintained classic ‘grand resort’ with everything you could possibly need.   The arrival is beautiful and the grounds are enormous. It’s licated…"
5,"This is the first time we have stayed in the sterile, gated community of Nusa Dua, and it really isn't our idea of Bali, and took quite some acclimatisation.  There is nothing out of place and the buildings and gardens are immaculate right across Nusa Dua. However if this atmosphere is your thing then the Grand Hyatt provides it in spades. The resort is massive in scale, its on 40 acres with 600 rooms, multiple restaurants and a huge swimming pool complex. The grounds included beautiful large ponds, complete with constantly entertaining and promiscuous Balinese Ducks, and manicured lawns. We had a luxury escape package which included some meals, drinks and massages, which provided excellent value considering their very high listed prices, which were high range Australian prices.…"
5,"Simply brilliant. Customer service is of the highest quality, great food and the hotel grounds an utter joy. We have stayed in newer 5 star Bali resorts which we could not fault, but they lacked character, charm and were a bit ‘sterile.’ Our second trip to the Grand Hyatt in Bali. Already planning our third!"
5,We stayed at this hotel as part of a Luxury Escapes package which was great value. The pool area was terrific with pool side food and beverage service and fantastic water slides slides for the children. Great buffet breakfast with 3 restaurants to choose from and the grounds of the hotel were just beautiful. The location was also good as it was across the road from the Bali Collection which has Coco’s supermarket where you can grab supplies fairly cheap. The staff in this hotel were the most friendly we had ever come across and nothing was too much trouble for them! Only small negative about the hotel was the rooms were a little dated but other than that a superb hotel!! Will definitely stay again.

4,"Stayed 8 nights at the Grand Hyatt and were not disappointed. All you would expect from a 5 Star hotel. Good well trained staff, top class amenities and services and great grounds and pool areas. Fronts a good clean sandy beach, well maintained and beach trawled daily for litter. Excellent restaurants with special mention to Salse Verde (Italian), and Nampu (Japanese). Having said all that, food and beverages are not cheap, and wine as usual quite expensive. And whilst our room was adequate, it's time for a refurb. Wood grain finishes everywhere tire and date with time and a facelift is required. But mostly very much enjoyed our stay."
5,Our family has had three Luxury Escape holidays at the Grand Hyatt and absolutely love the place. Staff divine and restaurants even better this year. Of course the water slide is an absolute highlight of the stay for kids and adults as well 
5,Great hotel especially for families. Club access room recommended for couples and well worth the extra cost. The grounds of the hotel a true delight and plenty for families and children to do. Great restaurants with plenty of choice.
5,The Grand Hyatt was an amazing place with excellent staff. I would recommend here for everyone. Rooms are very comfortable.The location is super being right on the beach front. The pools are great fun some with slides for the kids. We will be back!
4,"It’s our fourth stay here and the usual bliss bubble has broken. Unfortunately an outdoor concert venue has been erected directly next door to the hotel and plays incredibly loud music - all through the night! At 6am I found some earplugs and got a couple hours sleep. We are located on the far side of the resort, I can not imagine how disruptive this must be to those staying closer especially those paying the premium to be in the grand club which is much closer than we are.  I must mention the Hyatt has excellent staff,stunning pools/ grounds and fabulous food- all the makings of a luxury hotel and this is why we return so frequently. However the noise issue is going to make us think twice next time."

4,"A major reason we chose to stay at the Grand Hyatt was the Grand Club, one of the best deals in Bali.  The Grand Club features larger rooms; a complementary happy hour, free breakfast, and fresh fruits juiced to order from 6:00am till midnight (gratis), and a pool restricted to Grand Club guests.  The happy hour was a happy two hours.  My wife drinks sparkling wine while I prefer a Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc, and the offerings were exactly to our liking.  But, even better, the food served during happy hour was so good that we had little inclination to try the Grand Hyatt restaurants, or even other restaurants in Bali. Freshly cooked hot foods, and no steam tables nor endless queues. The hot food was largely Indonesian cuisine.  The continental breakfast at the Grand Club was…"
5,"Originaly stayed @ Grand Hyatt in 1992 with my late wife, and with friends in 2017. The intention for 2018 was a totally relaxing break with my daughter which was totally successful based on the Hotel itself and its location. It was my third visit to Bali this year and undoubtedly the best. Look forward to returning next year for my regular Bali holiday. "
3,"The hotel is immaculately presented and the rooms are getting a little dated, but are still in very good condition. Beds are very comfortable. And the staff are very polite and lovely. The breakfast is not up to the levels of similar hotels, though they are limited in room I guess. It is very expensive so you'd expect all of the above, and the little things that go wrong could be sorted out with gestures back, but although handled with a smile, they will not give you anything for it. We twice waited for 30 minutes while they tried to fix our door.

Two small Bintangs not too much to expect. Nothing doing. 4-5 hours later…"
4,"Always relaxing and always great to return to the Hyatt. It was very busy this trip but the beach is always relaxing and you can find a quiet spot under a tree. the staff were always courteous and friendly. The one thing I would say they have to change is the music they had in the Salsa Verde, we heard the same song three times every morning. Was funny until it wasn't "
4,"Firstly, I’ll start by saying my family & I (hubby and kids - five & two) had a wonderful time and would probably go back. We felt safe in Nusa Dua (apart from the earthquake false testing! Details below). Next Bali holiday I’d split our time and go to another resort where you’re not so restricted to the resort and Bali Collection (big outdoor shopping centre and restaurants, which is great!) but overall it was just what we wanted relaxation wise!  Excellent: Amazing grounds and an abundance of pools, all taken care of with complete TLC.  Abundance of squirrels, ducks, birds, fish, goannas getting around the resort, it was fantastic! Excellent for families.   The big slide could do with a make over, but was so much fun! Kids wore themselves & us out on the slide.   Parry our…"

5,This was our 3rd time staying at Grand Hyatt Bali and i will be back! The staff are delightful. The food is amazing. Everything is very clean and well kept. The resort grounds are very well looked after. The pools are amazing!!! 
5,"What a great place to holiday. It had everything, staff were magnificent, facilities great food great yet expensive and I won't mention drinks. All over we had a terrific stay.  It's a fair way from the popular beaches of Kuta etc, but you really don't have to go to them as everything is packaged right at home."
5,"Stayed for 5 nights as a family of 4, with  interconnecting rooms. Rooms were perfect and as expected from a 5 star resort.  Grounds are stunning and yes there are long walks to the pool etc. Be mindful if you have difficulty with long walks.  For the first 2 nights we really felt the hotel was empty but it did come alive for the last 3 nights.   The beach is immaculate and stunning but due to the wave breakers it is a very dull affair, so use of the beach is almost pointless.  We had booked room only, and then having enquired about breakfast the costs were super high.  So in summary, a beautiful resort, somewhat placid. Not sure Nusa Dua is ideal for families with teenagers due to the very slow pace and lack of action nearby. Enjoy.  "
4,We had a good time and it’s a nice property with beautiful grounds and lovely staff. Especially want to thank Yugik from front office (I hope I have her name right - the bespectacled lady) for helping us to move rooms as my mother could not do the long walks to the pool area. She was extremely considerate and understanding to the issue even though the guest relations whom I called from my phone weren’t. Sometimes it’s just one individual who can change your whole experience and it was her for us.. It’s not like we did not have issues - there were some esp at the Salsa Verde but overall a great trip.

It took around 35 minutes to get there from the airport on busy roads, Nusa Dua is an upmarket area with security checkpoint on entry to the area.  The area suddenly turns very manicured and landscaped compared to Kuta. The hotel has upward of 600 rooms and is one of the biggest, the drop off and reception are quite dramatic in style, Asian/Japanese, very open and exceptionally landscaped with pools and plants. The staff are not pushy and are very helpful, we were checked in, passports held whilst we were there which is common and credit card swiped for incidentals.  The room was on the ground level and quite large, very clean and comfortable looking out over a…"
5,This was our 3rd time staying at Grand Hyatt Bali and i will be back! The staff are delightful. The food is amazing. Everything is very clean and well kept. The resort grounds are very well looked after. The pools are amazing!!! 
5,"What a great place to holiday. It had everything, staff were magnificent, facilities great food great yet expensive and I won't mention drinks. All over we had a terrific stay.  It's a fair way from the popular beaches of Kuta etc, but you really don't have to go to them as everything is packaged right at home."
5,"Stayed for 5 nights as a family of 4, with  interconnecting rooms. Rooms were perfect and as expected from a 5 star resort.  Grounds are stunning and yes there are long walks to the pool etc. Be mindful if you have difficulty with long walks.  For the first 2 nights we really felt the hotel was empty but it did come alive for the last 3 nights.   The beach is immaculate and stunning but due to the wave breakers it is a very dull affair, so use of the beach is almost pointless.  We had booked room only, and then having enquired about breakfast the costs were super high.  So in summary, a beautiful resort, somewhat placid. Not sure Nusa Dua is ideal for families with teenagers due to the very slow pace and lack of action nearby. Enjoy.  "
4,We had a good time and it’s a nice property with beautiful grounds and lovely staff. Especially want to thank Yugik from front office (I hope I have her name right - the bespectacled lady) for helping us to move rooms as my mother could not do the long walks to the pool area. She was extremely considerate and understanding to the issue even though the guest relations whom I called from my phone weren’t. Sometimes it’s just one individual who can change your whole experience and it was her for us.. It’s not like we did not have issues - there were some esp at the Salsa Verde but overall a great trip.

5,"Wow, wow & wow!! What an amazing resort in a lush, tropical setting with sublime gardens, pools, facilities and a beautiful beach on its doorstep!! From each of the wonderful staff who take every care to look after the guests and are truly warm and hospitable to the amazing entrance foyer, the large, comfortable rooms, the abundance of fantastic gardens, lagoons and pool areas - this resort left nothing unsatisfied. The plentiful restaurant and bar options provide great meals with a vast variety of food on offer. The buffet breakfast options were unlimited and all the meals we had at various times were better than good. The grounds truly create an oasis in paradise. Beautifully maintained and lush, each turn unveils colour and beauty. With a choice of four pool areas and the…"
5,"The Grand Hyatt on Bali is one of the most beautiful resorts.  The rooms are comfortable, with balconies.  The pool is large.  They have shops and a couple of restaurants.  The food is delicious.  Make sure you have a massage.  The Balinese that serve you are always beautiful.  So friendly and accommodating. They are always smiling.  Just across the road from the resort is a shopping mall and restaurants if you feel like a change of venue.  Very handy. "
5,"We stayed at this hotel for 10 days. It is paradise! So peaceful, so beautiful. The rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable. We were never disturbed by any noise outside except the waves of the sea.  The children had their bed made on the daybed and really enjoyed their little corner.  The hotel gardens are amazing, their best feature in my opinion. The swimming pool was right in front of the beach and the restaurant. There was always plenty of space in and around the pools. One of the pools had a slide which my kids loved.  Breakfast every morning was delicious and the staff were always very kind and helpful. There was always a good variety to every taste, savoury, pastries, cakes, fruits, hot and cold drinks.  At night there are people selling local artisanal products.…"
4,"Beautiful location, in a beautiful hotel. The rooms are in need of some maintenance such as mirrors and grouting. The staff are wonderful and you are close enough for day trips to Kuta or Seminyak. The beauty of Nusa Dua is that the beach is mostly free of hawkers. We have already booked our next trip."
5,"Best resort we have stayed in - peaceful, clean, lovely staff, great food.  We will be returning next year to celebrate my 70th birthday with family and friends.  We had a great deal at this resort with Luxury Escapes and didn't disappoint.  Everything ran smoothly and everything promised was delivered so thanks to the Luxury Escape team also."

5,"We celebrated our one year wedding anniversary. The hotel was absolutely amazing, great location and great staff. The staff made our holiday and in general the people there were incredible. Everyone was accommodating and we planned a romantic beach dinner on our anniversary day. The food there was absolutely delicious and the cultural show at the Indonesian Buffett restaurant was incredible.  No complaints whatsoever. They kept us in the loop when the earthquake aftershocks happened and kept us very calm."
5,We had a great time time at Grand Hyatt. We got a room which was sea facing and we enjoyed the view. Beach was nice and clean. They have an excellent kids club. Lots of activities to keep the kids engaged and safe. Although their kids club is charged but offers excellent value and meals are included. Staff was courteous and tried to make our stay comfortable. They offer surfing lessons as well for those interested. Overall it was an enjoyable stay.
1,"This hotel is not a 5 star and is in urgent need of room upgrades.   Really don't know where to start with this as this trip was supposed to be a very special one as we were meeting my daughter and grandchildren here (My partner and I live in Christchurch New Zealand and my daughter lives in Brisbane Australia)  It was fantastic to meet up with them but we had a few things happen here and one in particular was very serious and the thing is, it didn't have to be that way with correct planning and communication from management to their guests  This problem happened one day, we were in our room (a very outdated room that needs upgrading and proper cleaning)  I was having a shave and my partner was waiting for me, we were going to meet my daughter, her husband and the children by…"
4,We recently had a Luxury Escapes Package at the Hyatt.  The package was definitely value for money.  The Kriya Spa was amazing and a beautiful place to have our massages.  The many pools were stunning with the children especially loving the waterslide.  The hotel location is great and the gardens are stunning.  The hotel could do with a bit of updating and its looking a bit tired - in particular the rooms.  The staff and service was friendly and professional and all times.
1,"Having stayed for 2 nights in a 4 star hotel in Ubud, and being treated like absolute royalty, our expectations of a 5 star resort in Nusa Dua were obviously high, however, disappointed is an understatement.   I’ll start with the positives - 98% of staff are friendly, the bar that is opposite the main lobby and the ladies working in there are really friendly and drinks and food are the best in any establishment in the hotel (compared to the restaurants we tried). It’s a pretty hotel with pretty grounds.   I actually don’t know where to start with this review, things went from bad to worse during our stay at the Grand Hyatt, so much so, that we were due to stay here for 5 nights but we ended up laying 2 nights (which was far too long) checked out early and booked another hotel…"

5,We arrived in April for a two night stay and were not disappointed. We were a family of 4 and had put in a request for rooms close to the beach. Guess what?! We got a pair of interconnecting rooms very close to the beach. The property is probably the best in Nusa Dua and well maintained. It definitely must be a tall order to maintain it. I can understand why things can occasionally go wrong The check in was fast. Only grouse: they block an awful lot of money upon arrival on the credit card and I am told this is a standard everywhere. Rooms are well appointed as can be expected at all Hyatt properties. Breakfast is a standard fare. The restaurants are great. Do not miss the roof-top cafe. We dropped in before 7 pm and were surprised by a well-done pizza free with the red wine we…
3,"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua for 11nights in August on a Luxury Escapes package plus one day.  Probably the most beautiful grounds of any resort we've stayed in.  The food was generally good but expensive as is usual in higher end resorts.  The breakfasts are highly predictable.  Not much variation there.  Only a short walk to the Bali collection and other restaurants which are less expensive but still dear by Bali standards. Nusa Dua is easy on the eye but expensive.  Also a short walk to get a beach massage to the left of the hotel, and there are restaurants in that area that are good value.  The beach where the Hyatt is located is very shallow and rocky.  Once again going to the left or right of the Hyatt gets you to a better swimming area.  Our room was old but…"
5,"Upon arrival we were greeted with traditional music of Bali, a cold towel, and a refreshing drink at the lobby. Balinese art is all around. The hotel grounds are expansive with gardens, pathways of bridges, and the relaxing sounds of waterfalls. Excellent to see  ducks, fishes, squirrels as part of the hotel's care, and to hear frogs in the night. We weren't able to swim in the sea because the red flag was up signalling bad water condition maybe due to jellyfishes, but there were many pools to choose from. We joined the daily activities offered for free by the staff like aqua aerobics, introduction to scuba diving, and stretch and tone exercises. Our room was large with the luxuries of a 5-star hotel.  The only hitch though, is if you have a hard time walking. It can be…"

5,"Back here yet again, for good reason. I tried a villa at Ayana last time: my mistake. Don't be fooled into thinking that paying more means you get more. This is the best hotel in Bali. It's like the Raffles in Singapore or the Windsor in Melbourne. Timeless elegance on a grand scale with stunning gardens. It leaves everything else in the dust. Staff are the epitome of happy, friendly and helpful. Stay at the Club if you can. It's serene and quiet, apart from the beautiful live gamalans playing between 5-7pm. There is nothing like this hotel in Bali. Don't expect chrome and glass. This is all about acres of marble, parquetry and frangipanis. The definition of elegance. All of the rooms are good. The suites are amazing, but this time for me the slightly more humble 2253 is perfect…"
4,This is difficult - this is a 5 star rated property - however TripAdvisor only provides 3 average and 4 very good - this Stay was more good so it’s a 3.5 really. This property is expansive - well maintained but old in decor and needs an update -headboard of the beds  hitting against hanging pictures - cabinet that holds the mini bar and  Coffee/ tea facilities was broken - and you actually couldn’t open it up to get the kettle out even if you wanted coffee or tea - but that amenity fails a five star / club facility in almost all similar hotels in that it does not offer an espresso machine in room.

1,We were staying next door at the Inaya Putri and had walked past the hotel each morning and thought it might be nice to visit their Italian restaurant for dinner as it was only next door and thought that guests from other hotels  would be welcomed. Well we were wrong!  On arrival at 7.30pm we were completely ignored so had to walk in and find someone to ask for a table and a menu. We were asked our room number and told them we were staying next door at the Inaya. Big mistake! The restaurant was virtually empty and we were shown to a table near the kitchen. We asked to move to a table on the balcony that was free ( only one occupied at the time out of a potential 8)  and were told we couldn’t sit there as it it was ‘reserved’  We ended up seated at another empty section that was…
1,"We booked this hotel for a couple of nights in August and out of the 3 weeks we spent in Bali, this was our most expensive, yet most unhappy part of our stay. We booked this hotel because we thought the Grand Hyatt brand would ensure it would mean that facilities, service and everything else would be of the highest quality, but we were so wrong.   Kids Club Our 18 month old was denied access to the kids club. We were told that parents were not allowed in the kids club and they didn't accept children under the age of 3. This was particularly disappointing as it was raining heavily on one of the days and there was literally nothing available for our child. They wouldn't even let our child use any of the toys when supervised by us. We raised this with the manager who suggested we…"
5,We had a great stay in nusa dua. The hotel was Lovely. Great facilities gym an pools are to a really good standard and the service was second to none that we had during our time in Bali. Especially Pari who made a point of coming to see us every day even if we weren't in his section. I wouldn't hesitate to return or recommend to friends and family.

5,"The hotel has the following advantages: 1) Big territory with well developed infrastructure (exchange points, taxi services and etc); 2) Large rooms; 3) Location (1st coast line) 4) Very polite personnel; 5) Several swimming pools with diferent designs. But at the same time hotel has some disadvantages, of course: 1) Long distances (i.e. going for breaksfast from the room) 2) The same menu for breakfast everyday  Overall, it is very good and comfortable hotel for couples and families."
5,We had a fabulous experience at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua in Bali. High quality service that kept up to the brand name. A must visit hotel for those considering Nusa Dua as your destination. You will not regret the decision. 
4,"The hotel is massive.  Rooms were really good.  Love the concept of the hotel.  There are more stuff & activities in Kuta beach area than Nusa Dua.  However, this hotel is a nice place to relax and enjoy.  Good for persons traveling on business."
5,"After the earthquakes in Lombok, Our hotel canceled on us due to damage. I scrambled and decided on Hyatt. Others say it’s old and worn, but beauty’s in the eye of the beholder. Newer resorts may be trendy and upbeat. But Hyatt has aged gracefully. You cannot get the lush gardens and perfectly manicured trees from a nursery; it takes decades of growth to get this beautiful. Upon checking in my room I had a few notes from rooms manager and guest relations welcoming me as a discoverist member. Nothing better then a cigar, watermelon juice and some tiramisu. Thank you Hyatt for the warm welcome. I’ll be back, Rm 1524.  "
4,"We stayed for 2 nights at the property having travelled around the island for less than a week. Upon arrival I was astonished by the amazing ocean view being combined with the hotel’s landscape garden. We booked a grand club king room, and was rightly being escorted right away to the grand club area which was tranquil and just amazing. Service staffs at the grand club area were exemplary and very pleasant. They could easily be the best service team in Bali. Upon check in, we went into our room and felt that the room was old albeit clean and well maintained. The hotel has a great beach at the back as well which was perfect. If there is 1 thing I was disappointed i, it will be the toiletries that the hotel provided. They were cheap toiletries which are not really a 5 star…"

5,"Me and my partner stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 11 nights in June, must say this was the best holiday we’ve both experienced. Not only was Bali beautiful and home to the friendliest people, but the Grand Hyatt also was amazing. The staff were super friendly, the staff on the help desk especially. So helpful and lovely! We grew quite close to one lady in particular, her name being Elya. Upon our departure we were left with two gifts left from Elya a Sarong each which was so nice, thank you! The hotel is so relaxing, we spent the first few days just chilling (think we had a bit of jet lag). The only negative I have to say about this hotel is the overpriced food and drink they serve, also we were a bit shocked that when we had arrived at the hotel (tired after travelling for almost…"
1,"My wife and I were staying at Inaya Putri, the resort beside Grand Hyatt Bali. We were walking along the beach and decided to sit on the sand under the shade. This was around 5 meters in front of Grand Hyatt Bali's lounge chairs. A guard by the name of Renis D approached us and asked us to leave because we're not staying at Grand Hyatt. I told him we know the law and that they didn't own the beach. He scoffed and still asked us to leave so I took his picture and told him I would report him. He looked surprised and started to take my picture as well. It escalated and we cursed each other and my wife and I decided to leave and reported it to Sastra, the Grand Hyatt manager of the pool area. This is not the first time (a similar incident happened in 2016 that went viral) and…"
4,Arrival at the airport is the most scaring experience ever. The people really harassed us for their taxi service. No grab or über or bluebird is allowed to pick up people at the airport. Only a scam taxi company! Charged the triple amount 18€ instead of 6 and there is nothing you can do. Arrange pick up with the hotel 30 usd? is my recommendation if you pay a lot than pay the right people. Arriving at the hotel the view and welcome was awesome. It's a privat secured area where the hotel is. So do not expect a local experience around there. The hotel area is well maintained and very nice. Plenty of dining options available. We tried the Japanese one and it was very nice and authentic with a Japanese chef. Beach is long but with a lot of plastic. Even many locals tried to clean up…
4,"We were wrapping up a Bali holiday (having traveled extensively across the island) and stayed here for the last 3 days before flying out. First, the location. Nusa Dua is an enclave of resort-style hotels. Once in, you are separated from the true Bali. OK for us as we had had our fill but may not suit others. I was looking forward to shopping at the Bali Collection but was deeply disappointed (just a whole bunch of souvenir style shops). The shops within the Hyatt offer better selections but at mostly US prices. The hotel in itself is what you expect from a Grand Hyatt, albeit a slightly older property. The age shows in some areas - pool tile, room ceilings etc but most areas have been refreshed. We stayed in a large, one-bedroom ocean view suite, which we were quite happy with.…"
5,"First time at Grand Hyatt Bali. Staff are very friendly and welcoming, always a friendly smile and so genuine.  The room was large and clean. Our twin share king single bed was very comfortable, but I did think it needs a little TLC. I found the heavy blinds a bit outdated. Our rain shower squirted everywhere and drenched the bathrooom, but when mentioned to management the shower head was replaced within the hour.  Resturants are very satisfactory, as are the bars. Hotel prices are in par with Australia, but remember to add on service and tax charge.  The large gardens and ponds are beauitiful and very well maintained. The beach is also beautiful, good for kids and adults. I would be happy to return to this hotel. Highly recommended."
5,"Me and my partner stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 11 nights in June, must say this was the best holiday we’ve both experienced. Not only was Bali beautiful and home to the friendliest people, but the Grand Hyatt also was amazing. The staff were super friendly, the staff on the help desk especially. So helpful and lovely! We grew quite close to one lady in particular, her name being Elya. Upon our departure we were left with two gifts left from Elya a Sarong each which was so nice, thank you! The hotel is so relaxing, we spent the first few days just chilling (think we had a bit of jet lag). The only negative I have to say about this hotel is the overpriced food and drink they serve, also we were a bit shocked that when we had arrived at the hotel (tired after travelling for almost…"
1,"My wife and I were staying at Inaya Putri, the resort beside Grand Hyatt Bali. We were walking along the beach and decided to sit on the sand under the shade. This was around 5 meters in front of Grand Hyatt Bali's lounge chairs. A guard by the name of Renis D approached us and asked us to leave because we're not staying at Grand Hyatt. I told him we know the law and that they didn't own the beach. He scoffed and still asked us to leave so I took his picture and told him I would report him. He looked surprised and started to take my picture as well. It escalated and we cursed each other and my wife and I decided to leave and reported it to Sastra, the Grand Hyatt manager of the pool area. This is not the first time (a similar incident happened in 2016 that went viral) and…"
4,Arrival at the airport is the most scaring experience ever. The people really harassed us for their taxi service. No grab or über or bluebird is allowed to pick up people at the airport. Only a scam taxi company! Charged the triple amount 18€ instead of 6 and there is nothing you can do.

5,"Loved everything about this hotel, 100% recommend! Staff were helpful and it is in a great location next to shops and loads of restaurants. I will definitely go back. Beautiful grounds, room big and clean."
5,"We had a great time here, the room was perfectly setup for 2 adults and 2 kids. The staff were always extremely helpful, the food at each restaurant was excellent and we spent countless hours in the pool and on the water slide. We couldn't have asked for more, the staff ensured we had a really great family holiday."
5,"We are two adults, a teenager and a 4 year old. We had a twin room with ocean view with the daybed which the kids slept on and it was a really good sized room so we didn’t feel like we were tripping over each other.  Our agenda was to relax by the pool and enjoy the beach but not do much else and the hotel was perfect for it! Gorgeous pool suitable for our teen and young one (with lagoons and slides), gorgeous beach and waves for surfing!  Good selection of restaurants to choose from but as with all nice hotels they are pricey compared to what you can get outside the hotel. There’s other restaurants in the next section of beach or behind the hotel in a mall called the Bali collection.  My only small feedback I would make are;  - the only Indonesian restaurant at the hotel is…"

5,"I have stayed in Grand Hyatt Bali several times now, this rating reflects my stay at Ambassador Suite; if it is normal room, the rating is likely to be lower due to rooms looking very tired now...  Anyway, Ambassador Suite in the Club wing is such a fantastic room! The room is spacious, bright, and comfortable. Even the bathroom has fabulous view of the sea and Hyatt landscape. There are windows along the bathroom and living room that cheer up the mood of the room. The balcony also faces the sea, making it a great option if one is lazy to go down to the beach.  I had very Long walks Everyday along Nusa Dua beach, and I have to say that Grand Hyatt Bali has the best beach in the area - span-wise and depth-wise arguably the best and I really like the vine trees which are very…"

5,"It’s my 6th Grand Hyatt all over the world and is the best one so far. We checked in around 1am and the staff are still all smiles welcoming us. Mr. Awan took us to our suite and was very friendly and entertaining. He even coordinated all my requests before my stay. Really commendable gentleman. The suite was huge, always clean and tidy, overlooking the ocean. Amenities were superb.  We had dinner at Pasar Senggal and the cultural show was really good. Special thank you to our server Dewi. She is one of the kindest and friendliest person i met. Really helpful.  We enjoyed the facilities in this resort hotel. Especially the swimming pools. Tried the water zumba... really cool. Two more staffs that stood out to us. Mr. Sabar at poolside and Mr. Rai at Salsa Verde restaurant. They…"
3,"I have been coming to this hotel for 6 years and normally spend a week or 2.   Firstly if the review was for staff and management it would be 6 stars. They are great and many of them I have a real deep respect for. The grand club staff particularly are brilliant. Urip, Norman and co just know how to make families happy.   The gardens are also now at a maturity that you won’t see in newer hotels. If you are a club guest the canapé evening is a great place to unwind and watch the nature around you.   Secondly the hotel has really upped its game on the food side. Breakfast in the Club is a proper breakfast.  The pizza the hotel does is also amazing as is the Indonesian food. This for me was the biggest problem in years gone by but they have seriously improved. Great delicious food.…"
5,"Incredible place perfect for a family get away wanting luxury and peaceful surroundings.  Impeccable service, delicious food, beautiful grounds.  Good size rooms with excellent powerful showers.  Thumbs up from us!!"
2,"All good, the hotel was nice... until we want to have breakfast with small luggage and 1 baby. the lady at the front is so rude (she said: “no no, no luggage, you must go. GO GO GO”), not at Salsa Verde restaurant. So we go to Slalsa Verde and they realy helpful. They call bellboy to bring my luggage to lobby. Thankyou"
4,The staff is welcoming. However the breafast options are very limited against the amount you pay. The swimming pool slide requires maintainance. The room size was good for a family of 4 (2 Adults and 2 child).>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

5,"Probably the finest beach resort experience that we had in a long time. The charm of the place and the incredible courtesy and hospitality has made us yearn to return back again soon.We eagerly look forward to returning back for the mesmerising Bali and enchanting Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua !"
5,"Great place for families lies and couples. Not much in the way entertainment for new couples but the plenary going on down the beach. Great facilities which are well spread out, ideal to relax, unwind and rejuvenate. Shopping and resteraunt across the road and good resteraunt sin the complex. Wonderful for a holiday."
4,"This is the 3rd time we have stayed at the Hyatt and still very pleased with the overall result. Relaxing atmosphere, great service and staff, good selection of food . Biggest problem is very noisy Asian adults at poolside."
5,This is an excellent property but very spread out. They don’t provide any golf carts to take you around.They are very rigid. I wanted to go to the main gate and they refused in spite of them having a golf cart which they use to take guests to the spa. The Hyatt club too ithe staff was not that friendly kinda off disappointing.The check in for guests for Hyatt Grand Club was very far from the main reception one comes tired after a long flight and then to walk so far... no golf carts to take you there. Nobody tells you that to go to the rest room at the pool area you need your room key.The pool is Fantastic with a great water slide.The pool was very big and long with beautiful rocks on the sides.

4,"One of the original large resort hotels in Bali, the Grand Hyatt has weathered extremely well over the years. Beautiful tropical grounds, a good beach and away from much of the hustle and bustle of Seminyak, which is great for chilling and relaxing, but does mean a bit more of a journey if you want to go further afield. For example it took us two hours to get to Ubud.  We stayed with your two daughters in two club rooms which offered us free breakfast and drinks/canapes in the evenings. The staff in the club lounge were fantastic and very caring and its setting was very tranquil, at least until a large monitor lizard was discovered the lagoon surrounding it, much to the excitement of many of the younger children having breakfast. The lagoon is unfenced as one toddler quickly…"
2,Had to pay for kids club which seemed small and suited to kids under 6. No extra activities for kids older than this. Lacked a fun friendly vibe.  No happy hour deals to entice guests to socialise.  Guest services were extremely slow at fulfilling requests.  Hotel was very spread out and not close to pool area.
5,"Ocean view room was comfortable, and clean.  Staff were generally courteous and genuinely interested in our well being. Salsa de verde - excellent In room dining - excellent Salsa Bar - beautiful view in evening to catch up on the day with few drinks Poolside bar - team very responsive. "
5,"Very nice surprise to be upgraded to a Suite. Thanks GHB. :)  Lovely resort property. Well maintained and does not show its age (room too). I was surprised at how massive this property but thankful we were booked at the Club wing which we felt was more quiet. The Grand lounge for breakfast and evening drinks was a nice touch. The reserved pool area was quiet and serene, service was good and food service was prompt. Quick access to the beach front was available and good quality deck chairs to lounge at the beach.  We ate all of our meals at the hotel. Vegetarian options were available but the pool side Vegan & Gluten Free Bowls were stand out for us. We ate these bowls every day at lunch. Thanks.  We head to the noise of Seminyak today."

Also no mineral Waters in our room. We complained about these matters to the bellboy and no response at all to resolve this.

Staff is very friendly and super attentive to the guests needs. Though the hotel was put into operation in 1991 (if I am not wrong) it is well maintained and is undergoing renovation now. Highly recommended for families with small children."
4,"Situated within a gated development this hotel had the most breathtaking grounds.  Upon arrival we were welcomed by a host of staff whom opened car doors, carried our bags, checked us in, provided drinks and cold flannels to freshen up.  Our room was clean and comfortable but was in need of updating.  Unfortunately the walls were quite thin,  the families in the rooms either side of us had young children whom naturally make noise.    Breakfast was a self service buffet with the biggest selection of foods I have ever seen offered for this meal.  Staff were always welcoming, which was appreciated  my only criticism is that sometimes they were too attentive, on a couple of occasions they cleared away before we had finished.  The resort had a good range of restraunts and bars…"
1,I suspect that most people that visit this hotel  come on a package tour selected by their travel agent or they are using Hyatt points. Certainly this is not a hotel for the independent traveller. I spend a minimum of 60 days a year in five star hotels and I rarely come across a property as bad as the grand Hyatt Bali. Notwithstanding the fact that the decor is straight out of the 1980s  our suite did not have a comfortable chair in the entire apartment. Bali is renowned for its food and it's quite hard to get bad food in Bali. However the grand Hyatt excels in bad food. Of the three meals that we had all were equally appalling. This hotel also seems to be grabbing any money they can from their clients--130USD for a massage and30USD  for a game of tennis. I shall not be…

The resort is extensive, stylish, beautifully laid out and has all the amenities you could wish for, as well as being well positioned in Nusa Dua.   My two boys - 7 and 10 - and I recently returned from a 10-night stay that we greatly enjoyed. The real standout at the resort was the staff - they were exceptionally good, and all friendly and helpful in an unobtrusive way. The resort has a veritable army of personel, from the numerous gardeners who work to maintain the resort's beautiful grounds, to the wait staff and cleaners, they really contribute to make the atmosphere extra special.  We stayed in a ground floor room by the Emerald Pools, which I would highly recommend. It's not too far from the central area…"

The compound is well maintained, clean, and the rooms are modern/updated.  There were also several pool options and it is very family friendly.  However the best part of the Hyatt was the exceptional staff.  Everyone went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was great.  Our waiter at the pool bar, Pariyatna Wayan was amazing!! He was so helpful and shared information on what to do in and around the area to ensure we had the best time.  Will be planning to come back with my family in 2019!"

We had a wonderful stay at Grand Hyatt thank you."
1,"My husband and I shared our wedding anniversary night at Salsa Verde. Our meal was quite an experience! We ordered 2x glasses of the Wolf Blass Shiraz, we were informed it was sold out $15 per glass. We suggested they open the other Shiraz on the menu in lieu slightly more expensive but were told no we can’t do that. So we decided to go with the local Shiraz which they served cold, we gave up & had water. We were  told that due to the climate we keep it in the fridge. What we wanted was someone with the ability to make a decision & offer a solution. No mention finding a solution. Perhaps a complementary dessert, open another wine of better quality. A hotel of this quality should not be running out of wine by the glass, there are so few to choose from, don’t put wine on the list…"

What we wanted was someone with the ability to make a decision & offer a solution. No mention finding a solution. Perhaps a complementary dessert, open another wine of better quality. A hotel of this quality should not be running out of wine by the glass, there are so few to choose from, don’t put wine on the list…"
5,We again enjoyed our stay at the Grand Bali Hyatt. This was our fourth visit for what we call a flop and drop holiday. we enjoy the beach and the many garden areas as well as excellent service from all areas.
5,"My wife and I wanted a winter break, I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt previously and loved the beach  location, quality of rooms, facilities, grounds and food. The staff are excellent in meeting your needs. We booked a Regency Club room and didn't want to leave the hotel we were so relaxed "
5,"Really enjoyed our stay. Perfect for our family of four - 10yo & 1yo on the Luxury Escape ticket.  Can't speak highly enough of the staff. Pools are great fun, spa is quality, shops nearby to escape resort rigamortis if a trip outta town feels too tough. Top breakfast too. "
5,"The resort was beautiful. Great staff, very friendly.   The beach was really nice, clean, we spent much of our time on the beach. The water was warm and blue.  There is an FX exchange on site and Tennis courts on site which we found very useful.  There is a shopping area nearby with lots of restaurants, and the resort had great food too, we had a lot of choice on where to eat each night. We had breakfast included and there was a choice of several restaurants for breakfast.  It is not close to the main excursions. It was about an hour away from any of the site seeing locations, like the volcano, the temples, the monkey forest, etc.  Overall a great holiday location."
4,"First let me say we had a fantastic stay up until the day before we left, we were already planning our next trip back. Our 5yr loved the kids club, begged to go daily (fee not so much).  Bali gets a bad rap sometimes but Nusa Dua is the place to be if you have kids or are older and don't want the party scene or drunken people.   We took advantage of several tours, some more kid friendly than others.I will list the pros/cons.  Two of our best memories will be the Safari,  pay for elepgant upgrade, its worth it and the waterpark (water boom).  Pros Friendly staff Great pools, all of them even the adults only Food was tasty Location  Big rooms  Cons Kids everywhere,  yes I realize I bought mine but I dont want to see them at the bar, Im ok with them at restaurants but the rooftop…"
4,"Hotel has the most beautiful gardens and surrounds - staff to be applaudec.  Checkin staff could lift there game for a 5 star hotel. Pools clean, buffet bfast good. We booked thru LUXURY Escapes and were happy with add on Resturant choices. Yummy authentic flavours. Beach kept clean      only a few vendors - not like Kuta or Legian, which was pleasant. Rooms are a bit dated , but very clean. Lovely foyer with outlook. High tea - was a highlight - good and position. It was our Anniversary and staff gave us a lovely dessert platter at dinner one evening Across the road from Bali Collection - variety of shops and Rest. Hotel has great overall position in Nusa Dua"

4,"One of my favorite parts about the resort is the property itself. The landscaping is beautiful and just walking around (and there is a LOT of space to walk) made me happy and relaxed. You can always hear flowing water or traditional music being played somewhere. The hotel is a bit older but has been well maintained.   The gym is nice with good space and equipment. We never went to the pool as we spent all our time at the beach but there are a few that looked large and well kept. One has a water slide.   The beach is very pretty with a bathroom (but don’t forget your room key to get in!) and chairs and tables set up. It was never busy, the water is very calm and clear, and you can walk up and down it quite far.   The Grand Lounge is excellent. We had access because of our status…"
4,"I stayed here with my wife during the end of July, and this is my first time to stay at hyatt Bali. The location itself located at the premium area of nusa dua with a huge location from the parking lot to the beach area. We are welcomed by the front desk office and were served a welcome drink and a cold towel. The room have a four wings and thank God the staff accompany us to the room. The first impression of the room was perfect. But when we go to the bed, the bedcover itself dirty of the sands, i am not sure if they clean it properly or not since i get the first floor. I like how they made a letter for me as i am a discoverst member, but once again, when i use a barefoot on the room, i was sure enough the sont clean the room or maybe it has been long enough vacant.

5,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 8 days on a Luxury Escape. We chose to upgrade our room and it was well worth doing as we were near a very quiet swimming pool which our 5 and 3 year old grandsons loved. The boys had a ball, spending a few hours in the fantastic Kids Club most days. I’d like to thank the ladies who ran the Kids Club for all the effort they put into it. The boys fed animals, face-painted, made lovely artistic creations and they loved every minute of it.  There were different activities every day so they were never bored.  The staff everywhere were lovely from the lady who cleaned our room every day, the spa staff, the bar staff to the receptionists. Would definitely stay here again and I strongly recommend this hotel if you have young children."
3,"i balance and judge this hotel against its own claim at 5 stars . the location is great , right on the beach , with the blow hole park practically part of the grounds . interesting buildings , well maintained . lots of walking involved . the rooms are large , the nooks for the day bed a wonderful addition . the bathrooms are tired , if functional . the only real problem we had , and i understand the weight of my claim , is that money went missing from the room safe . we are 100 % sure of it . it seems there isn't a safe hotel left in bali when it comes to this . it was 70 $ out of a stack of $ 550 . in rupias , of course . pity . it upset us ."
1,"Hyatt is well known as a brand to provide seamless experience, which clearly was missing. Service was terrible and slow, left 3 days earlier food was ok locals were really nice, and Spa was great! Rooms needs rennovation collaboration with luxury escapes is not worth the money. no impressed. paid $2200 for the package, was not worth at all"

5,stayed with friends to celebrate my 40th bday. that was my second time in hyatt. they made me feel so special! they even surprised me with a gift and a bday note. a grand upgrade and so many freebies truly made my bday a memorable one. thank you hyatt...will be back soon!
4,"The Hotel grounds are beautiful and generally well maintained. Only in some areas of the hotel, the buildings show their age.   The room was large and clean. Free bottled water is provided daily which is great. Only the masses of empty plastic bottles ending in the bin are a worry...  The big bonus of the hotel are the huge pools with waterslides - great for children. Sunbeds can be occupied if you turn up after 10.   The beach is very clean, with crystal clear water.  There are essentially three options for breakfast but they are more or less the same. Compared to other 5 star hotels, the choices are a bit limited and there is not much variation throughout the week (which can get a bit boring when you stay for 10 days) The Watercourt was our favourite in terms of the setting. …"
5,"grand hyatt Hotel is very good, nice, you can feel the 'Balinese'' once you enter the lobby with sound and it's peoples. Thebeach is very wide and beautiful. for family I very much recommended to stay in this hotel. they have good pool too, perfect for family trip."
4,"Firstly, the grounds and gardens are just stunning. Beautiful beach with clear water. We were lucky to be staying as Hyatt members so enjoyed the Hyatt Club lounge. Room was beautiful with lovely views from the bathtub. Staff were very friendly. Cocktails and food overpriced as you would expect as Hyatt. Club lounge staff were generally friendly but service needs to be improved with lots of errors as breakfast, wrong orders etc. Overall enjoyed my stay but wouldn’t return as the sheer size of the resort makes it impersonal. "
2,Just returned from the Grand Hyatt. The pool for 6 out of the 8 days was GREEN. The staff and service was hopelessly apathetic. The bathrooms stank of sewerage. There are a million better places to stay than here. Don't Bother.

4,"The extensive grounds here are beautifully manicured with tropical plants and balinese liliponds.  There is a huge pool with a fun waterslide, rock grottos and waterfalls (all 1.2m deep).  Five restaurants on site, all serve great food and have helpful, friendly staff.  Our room had an extremely large king size bed with a day bed made into a large single bed.  The bathroom needs a renovation.  Amenities at the resort included:  fantastic gym, huge spa, hair and nail salon, doctor, pool towel hut, good range of watersports, money exchange/onsite bank, atm machine, shops featuring local clothing and a corner store for snacks, drinks and toiletries/chemist.  Resort is located on beautiful private beachfront.  Bali Collection is a short 5 minute walk across the road with department…"
4,"There wasn’t a pool area available that wasn’t over run with children. We left the beautiful grounds daily just to get away from the noise.  Breakfast was just ok and very expensive. No place to just get a coffee in the morning, and there wasn’t a coffee maker in the room, so basically had to buy the expensive breakfast every morning just to get a coffee. Disappointing. "
5,We were welcome warmly with the 'gong' upon arrival at the lobby. All the staff is very polite and helpful. This is the best Hyatt service and relax atmosphere I've ever came across. We will definitely visit this place again.
1,"Me, my wife and my one year old baby is walking in nusa dua area to search hotel for my mother in law to stay in October for couple of weeks. as we walk and see premises from path way we like this hotel and immediately put it in our choose list. We continue walking to see other properties and see also few good hotels. As we go back to our car in bali collection area my wife decide to walk on the beach while it is a low tide and leave me and sleeping baby i Hyatt beach. I decide to sit on their empty sun lounger while my baby sleeping in his stroller. Not a minute later Hyatt security staf approach us, did not greet or ask if i am resident guest or not and just screaming that i need to stand up and leave their beach in Bahasa.

4,"The Grand Hyatt is a big hotel that seems to cater more to the all-inclusive, business conference, or family crowd. Which they do incredibly well.  Note: My fiance and I were there for a friend's wedding which was beautiful. We typically opt for smaller hotels.  Hotel is situated on a beautiful beach and within a secure ""compound"" of a number of other high-end large hotels. Loved the beach and pool, good breakfast, and on-site amenities and activities (Shopping and night market? Check. Cultural dinner and performance? Check.) which likely keep many guests/families on the grounds for their whole stay.  Hotel was super clean, comfortable, and safe but lacked a bit of charm. But what do you expect for a 636 room hotel?  Would absolutely recommend for almost anyone, but know that it…"
4,"Beautiful and expansive grounds with lots to explore inside and within walking distance of the property. Staff were amazing, friendly and attentive. Plenty to do for kids and adults. Note that the Kids Club caters for the little ones 0-6, not much for 7+. Still plenty for them to do at the pool, beach and exploring the hotel. "
5,"Grand Hyatt Bali is a great property. Lovely location with excellent beach access, lovely pools including infinity pool with poolside restaurant and bar. The hotel has countless small lilly ponds and excellent Bali ambience. A must stay. I suggest to skip other hotels and choose this one. The rooms are huge and has excellent view of the ocean if you choose ocean view rooms Lovely restaurants and excellent smiling staff. The gardens are excellent and  I wonder how do they maintain it  They have excellent balinese cultural shows in the evenings with dinner"
5,"Reading some of the reviews from other TA members, I was a little concerned about staying at the Grand Hyatt; however, as I was using points and the other Hyatt property was under renovation, I didn't have much choice. Boy, I don't know what's going on with those other reviewers...we had an amazing time and would certainly return again...and again.  We arrived at the Grand Hyatt after a long day of air travel and hassles with the taxi drivers at the Denpasar airport. What a magnificent welcome we received! I had used one of my Club passes for this stay but I had no idea what an upgrade this club pass would provide.  As soon as we exited the taxi, a Hyatt team member escorted us through the maze of buildings and walkways to the Grand Club Lounge which had an exclusive check-in…"
2,"This place is not 5 star resort. Maybe 3 star at best. The room is ok but bathroom looks very tired. Our fridge is not working but nobody seems to bother despite us complaining about it several times. The grounds are nice but pools look tired too, and water quality is very questionable (milky). Beach isn't for swimming. Check-In is slow, inefficient and not the friendliest. Even though the walk from the room to pools and breakfast area is very far, they don't offer electric golf cart services for their guests. It is mind boggling how overpriced this resort is. Until now I considered Hyatt a chain that stands for superb quality. Not anymore..."

3,"First thing that needs to. E said is that this place is not 5 star. Maybe it was 10 years ago, it is not now.  The Good Things  The gardens and lobby are beautiful. The beach is great and for Nusa Dua so is the location.   The staff are very polite and generally accommodating.  The Bad Things  This place still thinks it is 5 star and charges like it. US$32 for a foam surfboard for 1 hour!!! That is jus ripping off your customers.  The pools are not as big as they look in the photos and they have to serve over 600 rooms. They are extremely crowded, not blue, more a murky green and our two kids got ear infections within 24 hours. We did not swim in them after the first day of an 8 day stay.  Breakfast is limited. There was a better breakfast at the Sovreign H in Kuta (US$40 per…"
4,"Hotel grounds beautful. Pool nice, a little over crowded with kids. Grand club pool empty. But not allowed to access, also no information about this. Main pool was quite tired looking needs renovation and water quality was poor. Not chrystal clear. Like grand club pool. "
5,"The Hyatt brand is clearly seen at this property through the high quality maintenance of the resort, clean beach and fun kids pool. The spa is excellent. Rajneet the GM of the hotel is caring and attentive to feedback. Recommend for families. "

Would come again for sure just not school holidays. All the staff here are wonderful from cleaners to management level...at the Salsa Bar, Soori is a stand out for his hospitality.🍾🍹 "
5,"The Nusa Dua Beach Hotel was the third of four hotels we stayed at in our three-week trip to Bali.  We had stayed here in our second trip to Bali and loved it so we decided to stay here again and since we knew the resort and really love it, we stayed here for six night vs five night at all the other resorts.  We stay in the Palace Club.  The Place Club is more expensive and offers a lot.  The rooms are in a separate section of the resort.  They overlook a beautiful park like section with a small lake with their own ducks (9 of them),  It is truly peaceful  The Palace Club is more expensive than the regular rooms but we felt it’s well worth it.

Everything was beautiful and the level of care that was taken with our special day was amazing! We stayed at the hotel for 10 nights, along with our guests, which gave us a group booking discount. We all had such a wonderful time, with the hotels timeless beauty and lucious green gardens being like nowhere else. We were treated like our wedding was the most important thing in the hotel. The Coconut Gardens and Salsa Bar were simply amazing venues, with all our guests being overwhelmed with the sheer beauty of our wedding. We wanted something special and unique, and the Grand Hyatt delivered, and exceeded our expectations.   In particular Hana and Sherly,…"

We were met at the kerbside by a lovely lass who knew our names and showed us to a couch in the foyer where we were given a cool drink and cold towels. We knew we had a little while to wait for our room as we had arrived early, but we didn't mind as it gave us time to start exploring this beautiful hotel which is set on a hill with the most amazing gardens togethr with lots of pools, lagoons and fabulous wildlife. Our room was soon available and we were shown to it by another lovely lass who explained and showed us everything in the room. I have read about dirty rooms, mildew…"
5,Expecting a high standard from Hyatt I was not surprised be greeted with courtesy and friendliness. As our stay continued my expectations were exceeded . It was a totally satisfying family celebration . We would do it again anytime .   
5,"This was our second stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali.  It was great to see many of the same staff that were there last year and they made us feel very welcome, again.  The rooms and facilities of the hotel are of the highest standard.  The staff are also very friendly and helpful and always greet you with a smile.  The location is excellent being right next to the Bali Collection.  Overall, a great place to unwind."
3,Our vacation to Bali was amazing. The lobby is amazing!! The views are spectacular until you get to the room. Rooms have old furniture and walls are scratched. Smelly pillows and dirty sheets that has blood stains on them. This should not be a 5 star Grand Hayatt . Deny the manager was amazing he tried to make it up for us . He gave us better rooms and had house keeping change all sheets and pillows for us. He was amazing. 
5,"We had our beautiful wedding at the Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua on the 2nd of July, and we couldn't be happier with how it all went. Everything was beautiful and the level of care that was taken with our special day was amazing! We stayed at the hotel for 10 nights, along with our guests, which gave us a group booking discount. We all had such a wonderful time, with the hotels timeless beauty and lucious green gardens being like nowhere else. We were treated like our wedding was the most important thing in the hotel. The Coconut Gardens and Salsa Bar were simply amazing venues, with all our guests being overwhelmed with the sheer beauty of our wedding. We wanted something special and unique, and the Grand Hyatt delivered, and exceeded our expectations.   In particular Hana and Sherly,…"

2,"It was a disappointing experience. The gardens are beautiful but the rooms are very old looks like were built in 60’s it’s not the part of design it’s really old, you can see the bathroom tiles and bathtub are old etc. Go there only if you’re with kids or want to hear children screaming and crying all the time. It’s not a place to relax. The staff is good and friendly they try to do their best, but the hotel is so crowded and noisy that they can’t be attractive enough. We had to wait in line for breakfast every morning, the food is good though. Other restaurants in the hotel are RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED (for example one coconut usually is 25000 rupiahs in another hotel 30, but in Grand Hyatt it was 82.000 which is crazy, same with other foods and drinks it triple the price but…"
4,We stayed here for 8 nights on a Luxury Escape deal & it was a great deal & good value for money.  What makes this hotel apart from the well kept public areas & the lush gardens & clean beach are the staff.  Always polite helpful & friendly & professional truly service with a smile.  If however you are booking with Luxury Escapes be aware that you will not get a Grand sumptuous room as described. We were given a standard second floor room which while a good size was scruffy & battered & space taken up by a daybed with a mattress that had obviously seen better days.  I am sorry to be negative but I have to give an honest review.  The mattress was firm & the sheets crisp & clean with the room serviced daily.   We would return but next time would make sure we knew what standard of…
5,It is wonderful property on sea beach beautiful lagoon swimming pool marvellous landscaping and great atmosphere. one can  enjoy this five star hotel for two three days stay easily also a charm Of morning walk around
4,"We stayed at club room which had happy hour that offeres every day between 5-7 pm many finger food, salads and snacks accompanied with wines and beer without any charges. That was a great advsntage for those who wants to spend their time mostly in the hotel. There is also a seperate and calm pool for club’s guest just in 50 meter far from ocean"
4,"Grand Hyatt -Nusa Dua We stayed at Hayatt for 3 night in June. The hotel is nice but really big for our taste. The buildings are spread out and the grounds are nicely manicured with lush foliage, quite a few coi ponds and architectural structures and statues that are common in balinese culture. We had a small issue with bath towels and that was resolved immediately. The staff is very friendly and the check in and check out was very efficient. We went to couple of restaurants, Garden Cafe and Salsa Verde. The rest of our meals we had in the outdoor mall called “Bali Collection” where there are numerous restaurants. Have to mention that the best sate was in Hayatt’s Garden Cafe and we tried them every day in a different place since we came to Bali.  I would not recommend pizza in…"

5,"I wanted to write here because before we came I read many unflattering reviews and I was concerned. I’m thrilled to say this hotel is great. I’ve been walking around thinking I just can’t understand how people could not think this is gorgeous.  Sure the rooms are a little out of date but they are still modern and clean, certainly not a deal breaker (don’t get me wrong I love modern interiors). But it feels like Bali here.  We are staying in room 1425 right now and we are very happy. Even has a view to the ocean. I can recommend the North wing of the hotel. I cannot comment on the other wings. I assume the rooms would be similar.  All the staff have been lovely. The grounds are palatial and well kept. Breakfast has lots of options and even though it’s school holidays it never…"
5,"We stayed with family (child + grandparents) for 9 days and loved it. We used the Luxury Escape upgraded package for two-rooms & we felt it was tremendous value.  We particularly enjoyed the variety of pools, the variety in food with the different themed restaurants, the live music at the lounge bar & the excellent service. We have stayed at newer & more exclusive resorts in Bali before but we enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere & vibe here. We would stay again for sure. "
1,"The hotel is so dirty and the staff is not friendly especially the reservation person named Adi. He was rude and unkind.  The bathroom has so much mildew that we didn't let our kids to take a bath. When we asked to be moved, Adi was going to charge us extra for another room, so basically we had to pay extra for a ""clean room"". The hotel is run down. It's time to renovate those disgusting bathroom. There was blood on the wall. We just couldn't believe it was a Hyatt."
5,"We stayed here last year for our honeymoon trip, we stayed for 6 days here and we enjoyed a lot.  +Location : this resort located inside a kind of luxury area which many well-known brand resorts near by, there is a shopping area right in front of the main gate. We could not take a grab in this area and using taxi in stead.  + Food : Nice breakfast. My wife's birthday was one of the day on our trip so we went to the Japanese restaurant for celebrating her birthday and I arranged a birthday cake which I requested to make my wife surprise. I was! Even to me haha. In the end of the meal, all the staffs came out with the cake and sang the Happy Birthday song, that was amazing and my wife was so happy. Lovely moment! The Chef who has pepper dropping skill with ""snack style"" very…"
5,"We brought our kids here (7 and 6 years old) based on other reviews and have not been disappointed. The place is expansive and beautiful with lots for everyone to do. We’ve not tried the Kids Club but it looks busy every day and looks fun. It’s well set-up and staffed well. Food is excellent with a lot of choice. Quite a few different pools and even a couple of water slides. We are here during Aussie school holidays but it doesn’t feel overly busy as there is ample space for everyone. Large shopping area just outside the hotel, about a 5 minute walk.  Would definitely come back again. "

5,"This is our second stay at this beautifully landscaped property, and this time we brought extended family along with us! We spent 8 wonderful nights at this majestic resort, with 4 kids in total who adored the waterslide, grounds, kids club, beach etc.  Walking to and from facilities is a relaxing and serene experience within itself, with the lovely Balinese music in the background we can hear playing from the Lobby area. The moment you set foot here, it just takes your breath away.   We booked our final 3 nites in Bali at a highly acclaimed resort in Legian, which we instantly regretted once we got there! Even my children who are 8 & 6 commented on how they just wanted to catch a taxi  back to Grand Hyatt Bali Nusa Dua!  We are looking forward to coming there a third time…"
2,Everything good to very good until we discovered a rotting item left by a previous guest inside the room. The staff response was very poor - I had to report and request thrice before an action was taken to clean up - and it ruin my experience and impression of the resort and the brand.
4,The property is quite awesome. Lot of fun activities for the kids. The beach is quite good but a bit filthy during low tide when you will see a lot of trash floating around.  The rooms are good but the one we stayed in seems to have a problem with the toilet exhaust. The toilet used to stink a lot most of the times. Other than this the rooms are quite spacious and even has an extra bed. A family of 4 can be easily accommodated.  Overall a good place to stay in Nusa Dua.
5,"Just back from 10 nights at this lovely hotel.   I booked it last year and as a result of reading negative posts on here earlier this year I thought about changing hotels - thankfully I didn't!!  The hotel is brilliant and location is great in the gated Nusa Dua area.      From arriving at the security check, greeted from our car by name at the entrance to being taken to our room it was all so personal and faultless - it made you feel very special indeed.   We were in the Grand Club section (room 2238) and it is definitely worth paying the extra.  It also includes daytime refreshments and between 5-7pm you get complimentary drinks and food - could not fault it and the staff were just so friendly.     Ate at all the restaurants apart from the Japanese and the standard of food and…"
4,What can I add to all the reviews of this wonderful place and their sustained spirit of service?   Well the Hyatt could do more to educate new tourists to Bali about respect for others. Eg when they arrive late to be quiet. The Hyatt could do a little more to facilitate meeting fellow travellers such as with a table tennis competition.   We both got bali belly at a Hyatt cafe. The staff were very helpful. It’s lurking. What more can one do? There is a lesson from cruise ships that require you to sanitise your hands prior to entry for meals. This is especially important when there are 400 self serving at breakfast.   Don’t get me wrong we love coming to bali and enjoyed our stay here.

5,"We stayed here 4days. our room is at the South. Here is good for family to go seaside and pool, i think. It is not so far for child. Slider is popular for children. My daughter liked there and everyday she was fun.  Seaside is also nice. Especially, in June night at 21, the star is able to watch and we can see southern cross. This event was special memory for my family. Seaside was cool and we talked under stars.  Staffs were very kind. Especially musician played music with Indonesian instruments. They played the child music for my daughter. It was very nice memory for her."
5,"This was our 5th stay at the Grand Hyatt over the past 10yrs and I can truly say the quality, attention to detail, and staff friendliness has only gotten better over the years. For a fabulous view, many pools, great restaurants, and incredible service - look no further!"
5,Loved this resort - the staff were amazing -landscapes were unbelievable - beach was great - pools incredible and the dining was fantastic  Cant complain at all.  A few people have complained about the rooms in previous reviews but we had not complaints at all.  They are not as modern as some we have stayed in but seriously with so much land and things to explore and do why would you stay in your room!
5,Perfect venue for our event. no other venue in Bali would have met our group's requirement. Special mention to Fitria and Ima who's untiring work/ dedication for this event has been amazing. They were very detailed and efficient. 
4,"The Hotel is much better in actual than what it looks in the pics. It is grand, plush and friendly, and located just in the heart of Nusa Dua. As you enter the hotel, the Grand Lobby is definitely going to impress with the horizon view of the ocean. Rooms are spacious with facility of sofa bed which is ideal for kids. The kids are also going to love the Water Slide and the Lazy River. There is only 1 multi cuisine restaurant but it is good. You also have a italian and japanse cuisine restaurant within the hotel. Right outside the hotel is the famous 'Bali Collection' Mall, so you dont have to go far to catch up a dose of sea food, local cuisine or even Indian Food. All your shopping craving right from local shopping to branded shopping is catered well by this market.  So overall…"

5,I'm a Hyatt member so often travel to their properties.  First time in Grand Hyatt Bali.  Enjoyed my stay very much!  The property is situated in an excellent location.  Rooms are large and quiet.  Lots of amenities at the resort.  Exceptional staff!  Right in-front of the resort is a large outdoor shopping center with many restaurants and shops.  The resort is well suited for couples and families.  I'll return to Grand Hyatt Bali without hesitation.  
4,"Our Luxury Escapes deal was our passport to stay at this exquisitely landscaped resort with a beach frontage to die for. The place is enormous, with expansive central reception, shopping and dining areas, and almost 800 rooms divided into four 'villages'. Calling them 'villages' is somewhat of a diminution of the term, as they are only co-located sleeping spaces. Such a vast enterprise as this could provide some opportunities or activities for guests to meet, but these weren't evident.  A couple of things marred an otherwise relaxing week. Our lack of welcome by the unsmiling and unhelpful Adi made us wonder if we had made a wrong call. And our few requests through Reception usually had to be repeated after a few hours before being met. The breakfast buffet was standard for such…"
2,"Many reasons why my wife and I were very disappointed with our recent 3D2N stay at Grand Hyatt.  - Long wait at check-in counter. No proper queueing system to make sure guests can wait comfortably to be served, and no one there to ensure we are served in the order in which we arrived. Staff at counter were aware that we were waiting but did not dare to establish eye-contact with us. Totally not the kind of experience you would expect at a 5-star hotel. - Staff didn't seem happy to serve us. Not evident that they were putting in effort to please guests. Many didn't serve with a smile, and no eye contact  - Room wasn't properly cleaned. Still had food crumps on the floor, and there were ants crawling in the near the beds and also in the toilet. - Balcony floor was sticky. Seem to…"

5,"Wife and I stayed at this resort in June 2018 for 8 days by purchasing special deal from luxury escapes which included many extras like meals drinks transfers and massages. The resort itself is huge, massively spread out over acres and acres of beautifully manicured luxurious gardens and ponds. It has five swimming pools and five restaurants, two tennis courts and a small golf course.  The accommodation is divided into 4 wings and rooms are very large and opulently furnished along with bathroom and separate dressing area. Showers are hot and pressure is good. Breakfast was excellent with a great variety of choices to suit most guests tastes. Service was a little slow but that was to be expected with the amount of guests attending.   Resort staff everywhere were neatly dressed in…"
5,"It was a third stay at rand Hyatt and we are always amazed by the kindness of the staff, we feel like at home! We have 2 daughters of 11 and 13 and the only hotel they want to stay in Bali is Grand Hyatt!"
1,"Overall, this is the worst Hyatt we have stay at and does not meet the expectations of a 5 star international brand  Property is showing its age and needs renovation: rusty shoer handle doors  We booked a kind size bed and even confirmed the room type at check-in, only to find twin beds and being told the hotel was fully booked and nothing could be done.  Service quality is very uneven: a few some staff members were great while the many barely managed to get things done effectively. The place was under staffed.  Finally, my wife got food poisoning at breakfast!!

5,The Grand Hyatt Bali never ceases to deliver excellence in quality and hospitality.  You can relax as much as you like or enjoy many wonderful activities in the surrounds.  It is close to many of the other 5 start hotels and    a great little shopping center
5,"Once again, a superb trip to Grand Hyatt Bali. People were super friendly, And the beach so enjoyable. Will be back. Thanks for the restful beach holiday, The lounges under the trees, the lunches on the beach, and the cocktails. "
5,"Wife and I stayed at this resort in June 2018 for 8 days by purchasing special deal from luxury escapes which included many extras like meals drinks transfers and massages. The resort itself is huge, massively spread out over acres and acres of beautifully manicured luxurious gardens and ponds. It has five swimming pools and five restaurants, two tennis courts and a small golf course.  The accommodation is divided into 4 wings and rooms are very large and opulently furnished along with bathroom and separate dressing area. Showers are hot and pressure is good. Breakfast was excellent with a great variety of choices to suit most guests tastes. Service was a little slow but that was to be expected with the amount of guests attending.   Resort staff everywhere were neatly dressed in…"
5,"It was a third stay at rand Hyatt and we are always amazed by the kindness of the staff, we feel like at home! We have 2 daughters of 11 and 13 and the only hotel they want to stay in Bali is Grand Hyatt!"
1,"Overall, this is the worst Hyatt we have stay at and does not meet the expectations of a 5 star international brand  Property is showing its age and needs renovation: rusty shoer handle doors  We booked a kind size bed and even confirmed the room type at check-in, only to find twin beds and being told the hotel was fully booked and nothing could be done.  Service quality is very uneven: a few some staff members were great while the many barely managed to get things done effectively. The place was under staffed.  Finally, my wife got food poisoning at breakfast!! We travel extensively in many areas in China and South East Asia and this was the last place we expected to get sick (we are well traveled and don't get sick with food)  We will definitely not return.

3,"Here for business trip confrence for 4 nights,  Room is bit old and need a small modern touch.  The amenities,  The toothbrush and toothpaste is need to change, why not use with familiar brand such us pepsodent or colgate.?  I am sure 3 or 4 star hotel in Bali using it.  Thanks"
5," Great place for relaxing in Bali. Huge area; huge pool with hot & cold water jacuzzi, varieties of restaurant, big & clean beach, lovely sunrise at beach.  Indian breakfast is ok. Recently Indian chef joined hotel & are experimenting with dishes. As of now one dish per day. But no worries, as Nusa Dua market is across Grand Hyatt and you have Royal Kitchen, Bangle Bali & others restaurants offering delicious food with all Indian varieties.  Grand Hyatt offers all types of Indoor acitivities with a charge.   Overall ultimate place for relaxing & shopping. 30mins drive from airport."
5,"So nice Property and nr beautiful Beach very good Hospitality,all staff nature is too Good,helpful, breakfast is superb,,, enjoyed with family and once again come this property with friends.room services very good,"
3,"Giant resort with beautiful grounds and a nice beach... but there are better options in Bali at this price point.   We stayed here during a conference in Nusa Dua, and got an “ocean view” room. Definitely not worth it— to see the ocean you had to hang precariously off the balcony 😂 The room was a bit old and in need of a renovation.  It has a number of restaurants (Balinese, Japanese, Italian) and while all were okay, nothing was particularly memorable... except for the giant breakfast buffet. That was superb.  I will say that the number of great spaces, programs and treats they have for kids is impressive. This seems like a great case for a family vacation, but for a solo traveler or couple’s vacation, I’d pick somewhere else."
5,"We had a wonderful family holiday while staying at the Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua. Excellent facilties for families. Staff are very friendly & helpful. The resort was very clean & the location is fantastic, only a 2 minute walk to Bali Collection shopping centre. Highly recommend"

5,"We have been together with my wife in Grand Hyatt Bali for 2 weeks and we have experienced breathtaking services. It’s hard to describe it by words but if you wanna experience something different, if you wanna relaxed and be spoiled by local staff and wanna see one of the most remarkable hotels, just go there and enjoy it. We will definitely come back soon again."
2," We booked this hotel from luxury escape, A resort  suited for families, the gardens  are beautiful, staff are friendly, but the rooms do need major renovations , the food vouchers that they offer is average, gym facilities are great, & the private pool where we hung out the last few days was great."
5,"Our holiday at Grand Hyatt Bali was a wonderful experience.  The staff were delightful, the food delicious and plentiful, the room clean and comfortable and the surroundings beautiful.  Everything was done to ensure we thoroughly enjoyed our time there and we will definitely go back again."
5,"We have had the most exceptional stay at The Grand Hyatt, every restaurant outstanding, service amazing, our room overlooked Emeral Lagoon surrounded by trees &lilypond, peacefull, stunning 17 hectares of garden, need to experience this great resort"
5,"Had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. Hard to fault the resort with its nice room, great food, excellent facilities, and very good service. Loved the Salsa Bar overlooking the beach at nighttime for a night cocktail. June was an excellent month to travel with perfect weather and no rain Note that road traffic between Kuta and Seminyak is horrendous so day trips north can be very long! It took us 1 hour to get to a restaurant in Seminyak one night. I would highly recommend this resort though."

5,"I loved the Grand Hyatt for many reasons - the nightly traditional dance performances, friendly staff and the range of restaurants to name a few. The ponds around the area encouraged native birds as well as lizards and he gardens support a healthy but not intrusive population of squirrels that were very entertaining. The Kriya spa is gorgeous with separate treatment suites, water features and expert staff. I would be more than happy to stay here again."
5,"We reserved a suite at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua in Bali.  Prior to our arrival I reviewed the hotel on line and determined that they had a few excellent villas where I would prefer to stay with my family.   As we were checking in, I asked whether their Villa Tamblingan was available for the duration of our stay.    It was.   I offered 40% of their rack rate to rent it for the week.  The clerk at the front desk said it was not available at that rate.  I insisted that he contact the hotel manager and inform him what I had offered for the villa for the week so the manager could decide.  The manager readily accepted the offer but said it would take about an hour to prepare the room.  (That's because those villas are rarely occupied and it takes a while to clean up the villa and its…"
4,"Just returned form our holdiay last night. The property is no doubt one of the most beautiful properties. The pools and the landscaping is breathtakingly gorgeous. One can spend a relaxing holiday just at the resort. We ate a couple of meals at the Italian restaurant and were not disappointed. Good value for money as well.  However, the rooms require some upkeep. The room cards were often not working. It then turned out that the battery for the card machine itself was down. This can be quit disappointing once you know the distance from the room to the reception (I was staying in the West Wing). Although the hotel staff were extremely courteous and prompt to help, this can be annoying when you return to the hotel tired. The room flush wasn't working. They did promptly repair it…"
5,"This is our go to place in Bali. On our third stay we were upgraded to a suite. The staff are superb, so friendly and warm. The grounds and pools are sublime. We all love the water slide. The food is great. Choice of three locations for the buffet breakfast. Lots of animals around the place. Indian runner ducks and wild water monitors and squirrels. The entire resort is super clean and in great condition. Love this place."
5,"We have just returned from 3 days at the Grand Hyatt Bali. This really is a magical resort.  The setting and the grounds are absolutely stunning. The gardens and pool areas are so beautiful we took so many lovely pictures with family. It is immaculately kept with so much attention to detail.  The customer service was impeccable,  we had booked 2 rooms at the Grand Club level on our arrival we greeted like long lost friends where they made a fuss of our 5 year old on and let him bang the gong.   We were offered refreshing towels on our arrival along with a fresh fruit cocktail, we were then taken to the Grand Club where the check-in was very personal, friendly and efficient.  On arrival Made was extremely friendly and allocated us 2 rooms on the second floor in the East Wing. …"

4,"I gave this hotel only four stars because of some minus points which I will list below. However, I booked this hotel for the pool and because of the pool only I would book it again.   The river theme pool is stunning, water is clean and warm, beautiful flowers and bushes around it, never too crowded, has a small waterfall and a cave and even a waterslide!   I read before booking that the rooms are kinda old, which they are, but they are huge,  fully equipped and functional (they even put an iron and ironing table in the dresser). Plus, who wants to stay in the room when in Bali!  Now the less pleasant: the food and drinks. Since we were told from the check in that the best breakfast would be at the Salsa Verde we didn't even bother to check the other restaurant (Watercourt). At…"

We slept like teenagers the beds were so comfy, i have never had a holiday where i have felt so relaxed and rested, the pools were so nice and warm, our friends kids loved the big slide."
5,A good location. Peaceful and serene setting. Very clean and well maintained property. All staff are polite and helpful. An enjoyable and relaxing stay. Would recommend to couples and familes of all ages
5,"I am not exaggerating when i say this resort is spectacular! The gardens ponds and grounds are some of the best ive seen. From the moment we arrived  the staff could not be faulted, they are friendly respectful and a pure delight, doing everything they can to make your stay one to remember. We had a Luxury Escapes 8 day package which was fantastic value, which also incuded breakfast some meals, cocktails and massages - there were many pools to choose from and the kids loved the water slide. The food was amazing at every meal, the buffet breakfast was the best ive had a anywhere, every brekky food you  could think of- the day spa was the most luxurious place ive ever seen and the massages unforgetable by the delightful staff there. Yes the resort rooms are far from new, but they…"
4,"This was a very nice resort but after staying in smaller hotels in other areas we found that this one was way less personal and could have been anywhere in the world really, you wouldn't even know you are in Bali. But the staff we came across were very friendly and the breakfast was yum. Was easy walking distance to the shops. I stay here again if I was to bring my children back"

5,"I stayed there for 2Nights in Feb2018. It's a Huge Resort. I found this as one of the most luxurious resort in Bali. You need at least a day or two to explore the resort. Every area in the resort is photogenic. They have large pools, ponds, gardens, statues etc. The resort beach was clean and the sand was little brownish. They also have various shops inside. The resort have everything you need. Service was great and staff members were friendly. Breakfast lunch and dinner were amazing. Totally worth the money. I 100% recommend this hotel to everyone."
4,"Great way to ease your way into Bali. I see this more as a place for families to come and relax instead of solo travelers, friend groups or a trendy scene. There were lots of children running around the place and many families that appear to be having reunions. The area that the hotel is in, is very secure with lots of guards on every corner but it's a bit removed from the real Bali experience. The room was beautiful, spacious & clean but there was an ant problem... there were ants EVERYWHERE! And no, I did not have any food out. Would I come back? Maybe in a few years if I have a family..."

The staff are amazing yani , the lady who had a sore throat sorry forgotten your name and all the other brilliant staff all under the watchful eye of the amazing Urip. All the staff have worked in the hotel for years and they are like one big family to all there customers.

4,"The Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua is a huge hotel with giant koi ponds, many pools, lots of restaurants and charm. The hotel check-in is a huge welcoming open air space in the hotel. Yes the grounds are huge but not hard to figure out. Getting the daily breakfast included was worth it. Huge full breakfast of meats, eggs, fruits, juices, breads, etc. Our room was ocean view but it was located on the main floor so you couldn't see much of it. The koi pond off the patio and front door were pretty though. "
4,"The hotel design is very nice but the layout is very spread out, and it will take some effort to find your room, not only the distance you have to walk, but the room numbering system is not easily identified . The hotel staff is helpful and food is delicious. We are able person with no problem to walk around, it will be challenge for disabled person, because there are steps everywhere. They do have ramps but the ramp slop do not meet barrier free code and there are no railings along the ramp, so be careful. The beach is very beautiful, and the service is excellent."

3,Stayed here for 2 nights in May 2018 for a conference in a neighboring hotel.   First the good bits Very large and nicely appointed rooms. Reasonably well kept and maintained.  Reception is busy but efficient and room service is reasonably quick (for a large hotel). The gym is nice and big.  Hotel is on the beach so short walk and your on the beach.   SPA is large and quite nice.  Essentially designed for non residents looks like so buggy to and from the reception etc.  The massage itself was very nice and the room and shower etc excellent.  Pricey though I must warn you.    The not so good bits  This is a huge hotel - typical american style 700-800 rooms.  Therefore the overall approach is mass market.   There is very limited signage and the hotel is complexly laid out so…
4,"this is our second time staying at the Grand Hyatt Hotel Nusa Dua for a week and a very good experience again.  The room: Last time we stayed in one of the grand king rooms and really liked the room layout especially the built in day bed as it was the perfect size for our two young kids. This time after check in we were lead to a room which was different to our expectation. The room was a bit smaller and there was no day bed but only a fold out couch. After talking to reception again we were really delighted to be allocated to a room with day bed (same as the one we had 2 years ago). If you have young kids and don’t like to bed share, the day bed is perfect!  The Grounds: The grounds of Grand Hyatt was just huge and beautiful in every corner we turned. It’s not as posh as some…"
5,"We only stayed s couple of nights for a bit of luxury and it was perfect. The rooms are lush and the hotel grounds are beautiful.  The food and drink was very good. We ate in their open air theatre area which was great. It’s a buffet of the most amazing local food. I couldn’t fit desert in and I was gutted as it looked so good. I would go back here just for this buffet.  If you get fed up with the hotel, just cross the road and there is a massive shopping / food area. So cool! The beach here is beautiful! It’s s very short walk to the blow hole.  Very nice area.  I would definitely recommend. "
5,"Just back from holiday,stay at Grand Hyatt Bali for a week.friendly staff always smiling,our room was spotlessly clean and large,big garden,nice beach fron,hotel just a little bit old,The food at the restaurants are litle high for bali standart,resonable for western standart.  It's our first time using the Hyatt, best ever."
5,"Stayed for 2 weeks wirh my husband,had excellent time.Very good location on a lovely clean beach,sports facilities, fitness,spa,a few restaurants, bars,lovely lagoon style swimming pool  with 2 waterslides,jakuzzi,to mention a few...Excellent staff,makes you feel so welcome,you feel so valued...unbelievable.Thank you all for making our stay unforgettable, nothing was too much hassle.Thank you ,Elya Margarita,for helping us with the check out,making it so smooth, and supporting us with the airport transfer.Such a professionalism.All this makes you feel soo valued.

Pricey though I must warn you.    The not so good bits  This is a huge hotel - typical american style 700-800 rooms.  Therefore the overall approach is mass market.   There is very limited signage and the hotel is complexly laid out so…
4,"this is our second time staying at the Grand Hyatt Hotel Nusa Dua for a week and a very good experience again.  The room: Last time we stayed in one of the grand king rooms and really liked the room layout especially the built in day bed as it was the perfect size for our two young kids. This time after check in we were lead to a room which was different to our expectation. The room was a bit smaller and there was no day bed but only a fold out couch. After talking to reception again we were really delighted to be allocated to a room with day bed (same as the one we had 2 years ago). If you have young kids and don’t like to bed share, the day bed is perfect!  The Grounds: The grounds of Grand Hyatt was just huge and beautiful in every corner we turned. It’s not as posh as some…"
5,"We only stayed s couple of nights for a bit of luxury and it was perfect. The rooms are lush and the hotel grounds are beautiful.  The food and drink was very good. We ate in their open air theatre area which was great. It’s a buffet of the most amazing local food. I couldn’t fit desert in and I was gutted as it looked so good. I would go back here just for this buffet.  If you get fed up with the hotel, just cross the road and there is a massive shopping / food area. So cool! The beach here is beautiful! It’s s very short walk to the blow hole.  Very nice area.  I would definitely recommend. "
5,"Just back from holiday,stay at Grand Hyatt Bali for a week.friendly staff always smiling,our room was spotlessly clean and large,big garden,nice beach fron,hotel just a little bit old,The food at the restaurants are litle high for bali standart,resonable for western standart.  It's our first time using the Hyatt, best ever."

5,A very nice resort type of hotel by the sea. All staff speak English well and friendly. There are several restaurants in the resort which is nice. we like the stay and will consider to stay here again next time in Bali.  Lin
5,"We spent 6 nights in this hotel with my partner in 2016 as we were Hyatt staff from Dubái. All the staff in this hotel was very kind with us at all times. The hotel is beautiful and huge with diferent restaurants and pools. It's located on the beach so just need to walk a couple of minutes and you are on a beautiful beach.  The rooms are comfortable, our was quiet as it was looking to the tennis courts. There is a mall just on front of the hotel with lot of restaurants and shops. It was definately one of the best places and hotels I have stayed so far."
3,"Comparing it to the price it does not worth it. Convincing us to upgrade to a room under maintenance , they said it’ll be fixed so we went out for 7-8h we came back at 1 o'clock to sleep the door looker wasn't working, we went to the reception to open the door for us he said to us with loud voice “you have to understand that the system down can’t update the door for you” really ? Why would someone rent you a room under in maintenance?  In the same day, around 4-5pm we were in the room we ordered food from room serves it was OK wasn’t that good , and we call to have someone to clean the table and food while we go out, when we return to the room around 1 am we found the food still there, and the room smelled really bad, even though we called the room service to clean it up such a…"
4,"It was a pleasure for me to stay in Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua bali since the Hotel was a five star hotel and had a good name. The room was great, the bed was comfortable, but I have a lil problem with the shower inside, the tube isn’t work well and it’s hard to switch shower mode. The thing that I don’t like is, the hotel a lil bit spooky haha. No, I mean the hotel was old, and traditional, so I, alone in the room, and cannot sleep! Huhu. The food is great. I’d love to stay there again but with family."
5,Love our stay here. The room is spacious and very comfortable. It is set by the beach and we love it. The Nampu Japanese Restaurant also offers very great quality of Japanese food with classic Japanese ambience. We also love our breakfast buffet which has plenty selection of very delicious foods. We love our stay here!

3,My daughter and I stayed for 10 nights. We were greeted warmly on arrival and there were no problems with check in. Our room was a decent size with a nice view of a lagoon with water lillies and ducks. The resort is huge so a lot of walking is required. Breakfast was ok but we had to wait for a table every morning. We could have eaten breakfast at another restaurant but it was further away and the selection wasn’t as big. The beach was lovely but there are hawkers which can be a bit annoying at times. The swimming pools covered a large area but were connected. The kids pool had a water tunnel. A bit further on from this is a large pool which was not too busy and aquarobics was held every morning. High tea was held each afternoon ($30 for 2). It was very nice but you don’t get…
5,"My family and I had a fantastic stay. The hotel os has great location and it has everything you need. The kids loved the pool area and the beach. Breakfast was really, really good and the staff was so friendly and helpful no matter what we asked. The room was great for the four of us"
2,We stayed at the grand hyatt resort for 3 nights. After 7 days of visits in Bali we wanted to just relax and enjoy time in this resort.  All our disappointement started at check in. We arrived at 12:00 ( noon) so too early to check in but the receptionist started our check in and made us wait until 2:00 so our room could be ready ! ( of course its the procedure no problem we went for lunch at the pool restaurant) The lady ( yunik) mentioned that the room booked was room only without breakfast. Ok. Breakfast is additional. If we want we can book with the club lounge its more expensive but drinks and snacks are included.  We didnt want that but she was a bit pushy. So we decided ok we will take it and realized after that its not what we wanted so we declined.  At that point the…
1,"On our recent trip to Bali (May 2018) we stayed at a great resort in Legian and then we headed south and stayed at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua and another popular beach front resort just a few resorts down (not naming as my review might not get posted if i do). Out of all 3 resorts, the Grand Hyatt was easily the least enjoyable. In Nusa Dua the other resort was much more preferable by far! The differences in staff, resort vibrancy, accessible easy to use grounds and general appearance of the resort were very contrasted. Also, the inclusions and extra's the other Nusa Dua resort included for our honeymoon were incredible! The Hyatt just doesn't have that 'nice vibe positive resort feel' and you'll know what i mean if you stay there. The other resort was MUCH better so i strongly…"
4,"We stayed for 6 nights at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. The first impression is wonderful. Beautiful ponds and stunningly landscaped gardens with lots of birds and wildlife. The rooms are spacious but a bit dated. Our room had a nook obviously used for 2nd bed but was a useless space and felt a bit dirty, even to sit on. The breakfast was lovely as well as the location near the pools and ponds. I loved the architecture of the main reception areas and the Gym facilities were excellent. They have a pool at the gym that was peaceful and no screaming kids so that was a lovely escape.The main pools were very nice but did get noisy. Dinner was very nice. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful."

5,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali for just a few nights.  We were uncertain what to expect being a gay couple in a Islamic country, so we decided to stick with what we know...which is the Hyatt.  Being Globalists with the Hyatt goes a long ways here.  We were upgraded to a Grand Club Suite.  This gives you a private pool (well, restricted to only other Grand Club members, so the pool is much less crowded).  It also gives you complimentary breakfast, happy hour, and late check out.   All benefits that made this stay easy and enjoyable.  While the resort is well-maintained, the setting is pristine, and the food is great, what really stood out to us was the genuine service.  We had the pleasure of interacting with Ary, Norman, and Deny, among countless other…"
3,"We stayed for eight nights on a luxury escapes package deal , Good points  ,  Great pool and slide for the children  But closes way to early and no life guards  Room is adequate,but does need upgrading Safe area to walk around   Not so good Huge resort to get around ,long way to walk to pool ,beach , breakfast , unless you stay in north wing Breakfast was so boring, same everyday and hot food always cold Meals and drinks way to expensive  Would I stay here again ,would depend on price and deals ,not a five star resort I would rate it  3.5 or 4 stars "
5,"Magnificent truly five star resort. Set amongst stunning gardens, the resort is an architectural wonder. Beautiful pools, beach front location, great restaurants. A walk along the Nusa Dua shoreline past all the hotels and resorts will verify the Hyatt as the most beautiful."
5,"Had a great time here for 8 nights for our honeymoon. Everyone was friendly, the resort is great and the gardens are beautiful! Loved it! We really enjoyed sitting by the pool sipping on cocktails and the many restaurants are solid too."
5,Had not visited this hotel for 30 years when an Expat in Indonesia. The grounds are beautiful and the trees so old and give great shade all around the site and the Beach. The Grand Club is excellent for Breakfast and evening canapes and Drinks. The grounds are huge and the staff very friendly with generations of families working there. This is the old Bali. And a nice suite upgrade was given. And a plus is that once out of the Airport you continue over the toll road to Nusa Dua for a very quick ride...go the other way and you get the bad Kuta/Seminyak traffic.

The bathroom had a walk in robe there which was lovely. A toilet with a sliding door. A shower with 2 heads so you could work out what one you preferred. Fridge was small but that’s normal. They had tea/coffee facilities no milk but you just rang and they’d deliver for you no charge. Our room over looked a Balinese pool that was peaceful. Breakfast was a feast! Full buffet of western and Asian and you could eat until you burst! Eggs, bacon, waffles, fruit, yoghurt, noodles, miso soup, bread, muffins and more! Never ran out of food it was always full and replenished. The place has 2 water…"
4,We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Bali for 10 days in May. The pools close at 7pm and don't open until 8am...this is in the tropics when an evening swim is looked forward to.

3,"I was there at Grand Hyatt Bali to attend my business conference but not had a very good experience. Rooms do not look like 5 star property rooms and not maintained at all , service is also not upto the standards . The most important is quality of the food that was also not that great. Also a very limited choice for a VEGETARIAN for breakfast on a conference , practically had bread and juice. Surrounding is very good and you will enjoy. Hope management will look into this"
2,"I was here for 3 nights last week on a business conference. i understand this is a star property and should have some minimum standards.   But quite disappointed with the amenities and overall look and feel.  Firstly, the breakfast at garden cafe had very limited spread and quality in terms of taste was poor.   Some how for all three days I found the quality of food as questionable.   Secondly the room was pretty bad. Firstly the geyser didnt work Secondly, there were lizards and centipedes in room. cannot expect in a 5 star property. the quality of toiletries like body wash and shampoo was not great, very cheap and average."

They sent a serviceman to look at the air con and he was adamant it was working coz it was making a noise, I didn’t bother arguing coz he didn’t understand a word I was saying.

3,"Service was great, but unless you are going to be upgraded to a top room, this hotel is severely outdated and in need of a renovation. I visited some of the neighboring properties and I think the value is better.  Globalist perks – Upgrade and Free breakfast and happy hour in the lounge. The quality of breakfast and happy hour was more aligned with expectations for a hyatt regency in the US as opposed to grand hyatt in Asia."
5,"The customer service provided was impeccable. The gardens are immaculate and so beautiful. The pools were incredible. Go to the adult only pool if you want total relaxation. This pool also has a steam room, sauna and hot and cold plunge pools. Can also recommend the day spa, had a fabulous massage and pedicure. Would recommend this hotel for total relaxation. It is in a quiet position yet close to the bali collection for souvenirs and less expensive meals and drinks. If you are a little apprehensive about going to Bali, this hotel and Nusa Dua is perfect. Very international client base."
5,The Grand Hyatt Bali is a very beautiful property staffed by wonderfully gracious people who go out of their way to make you feel at home.  We love this hotel!  The food choices provide variety and are of exceptional quality.
5,"Stayed at the grand Hyatt Nusa Dua resort, grand sweet. It was spacious  Entrance and all hotel has an open design, but air flow is excellent and always had nice wind and breeze. Entrance reminds you of Cleopatra palace and lake. Housekeeping is doing the extra mile visit the room several times a day and top up missing items   Italian restaurant pizza and seafood dishes are remarkable  Gym facility is great and open 24 hours Hotel is 2 minute walk from a small mall with lots of nice restaurants  Unfortunately hotel does not provide halal food, but there is good choice of restaurants outside the hotel Overall we had great time and enjoyed the hotel facilities"
3,"Wentbhere again after my kids insisted. They loved the pool and beach. Unfortunately the food had not improved, there was a 2 day concert going on (including repetitions) that made a lit of noise and made all peace and quite dissapear. Whish someone would have told me that upfront. Breakfast is still great although initially it was not included in my price? I have stayed at the hyatt many times and this was the first time that happened for some reason? "

2,Geat hotel and facilities. Fantastic dining options. Unfortunately very poor check-in and check-out processes. We were allocated the wrong room type and it wasn't till 3 hours later that we had the right room. Hopefully just a one off issue and not an ongoing issue.
5,celebration of birthday and relaxing holiday. First time at Grand Hyatt Bali and it was by far the best resort I have stayed at.Beautiful gardens with lovely frangipani trees and very attentive and friendly staff.
5,"Just spent 6 days at this beautiful resort. Stayed in interconnecting Club rooms which is well worth the extra money with access to club lounge and a private club pool. Special thanks to Urip who is an amazing asset to this hotel. He is truely passionate about service excellence and ensuring his guests are happy.  Kids loved the waterslides in the main pool and the gardens are absolutely stunning. Although an older resort the rooms are large, clean and comfortable. Highly recommend this property for families or couples. "
3,"There is many 5* hotels in Nusa Dua, and this one has the best beach front of all... Shame this year, plastic garbage has made its way even there (but that's not the hotel's fault). We were first put in a West village room... So far from everything (you are alsmost in Jimbaran!!) and the room was so old... After complaining, they moved us to a North Village room. Much better, but that does not change the fact that all rooms need serious upgrading.... I mean UPGRADING, not touch-up guys! Your standards are not Grand Hyatt level or real 5* anymore. The location is perfect for families with kids, but if you don't have kids, well, pool can be a bit (very) noisy : luckly the beach front is huge and quiet.  Staff does not really seems to care about everything, and peak season has not…"
1,"Room and Hotel facilities are quite ok, meet the expectation in that price class, Breakfast buffet with a great variety.. Swimming in the ocean possible, but a lot of garbage in the water or at the beach front. Really weak point- I forgot my glasses at the breakfast restaurant and realized this 3h later- glasses were untraceable. Second one- we forgot a pair of kids shoes in our room, went to the service desk to check out, realized that the kids shoes are not around and went back to the room 10min after leaving- shoes were gone and nobody saw them again. Sorry to say, but they have a serious issue with the loyalty of the employees- Hotel is definitely not recommendable!!!!!"

1,"Room and Hotel facilities are quite ok, meet the expectation in that price class, Breakfast buffet with a great variety.. Swimming in the ocean possible, but a lot of garbage in the water or at the beach front. Really weak point- I forgot my glasses at the breakfast restaurant and realized this 3h later- glasses were untraceable. Second one- we forgot a pair of kids shoes in our room, went to the service desk to check out, realized that the kids shoes are not around and went back to the room 10min after leaving- shoes were gone and nobody saw them again. Sorry to say, but they have a serious issue with the loyalty of the employees- Hotel is definitely not recommendable!!!!!"
5,"Totally disagree  with the last few reviews below.  My personal experience has been outstanding and I have no complaints but instead great memories, all  thanks to this place.  This resort blew me away. I have travelled around and stayed at petty expensive hotels previously but  this has to be  one of my favourites  places I have ever visited.  This resort is literally less than 20min drive from the airport. When we landed in Bali airport, waiting at the baggage hall for over 2hrs,to later find out that 1 of our suitcase did not arrive.  This was not a great start, literally ruined our vacay mode.                                                                                        However when we arrived at the resort I was blown away. Incredibly beautiful.  Huge open space…"
5,"We were welcome at lobby politely,ask to be sat down at sofa presented with a welcome drink, whilst the staff confirm our administrative documents.  We were give a beachfront room( thank you hyatt) beautiful view to beach (with a tropical pond full of lotus,fish and ducks )which my child loves.   Breakfast were nice enough, there was 3 choices for breafast , choose the watercourt ( i think it is the best location)  All the stagf were friendly   Thank you hyatt once again   Note, for best rate I recommend call the property for booking , and enroll to the hyatt membership. "
4,"This resort is HUGE. It has a great pool and slides and it backs on to the beach.  It is a short walk to Bali Collection, great for shopping, convenience stores or eating out (food at The Hyatt is quite pricey). The rooms are a little tired, but being close to shops and beach is worth it. Club lounge access also available."
5,We had an amazing time and will definitely return to the grand Hyatt . Our room was big and the bed comfortable and big. We overlooked a water feature. The hotel is conveniently located across the road from a busy shopping centre which is just a walk away. Cocktails each night started at the salsa bar with an amazing view of the beach. The gym was well equipped and the gym pool which was a dual ts only was spectacular. The hotel suits families with the pools having water slides and kiddie sections. Breakfast was excellent a buffet stile experience available at several locations. We had a lovely time some things that could be improved were kids meals not many healthy options available . The shopping centre across the road provided a plethora of opportunities for cheap and…
5,First timers and the Grand Hyatt and entire staff showed us why it’s loved.  From airport pick up to drop off entire stay was seamless !   Room immaculate staff soo courteous and happy. Hotel can organise anything you ask.  Recommend using the Kura Kura bus out front for day trip to UBUD ($8) have lunch up there is rice field at Manisan restaurant . Easy trip !    See the Balinese dancers at the hotel and enjoy the dinner .  Have a curry at the garden cafe ! Walk to the water blow .  We will be back .

4," Great location. Very safe for families. Excellent service.  Huge variety of eating options Must try the Nampu Japanese rest Teppanayki experience. Amazing gardens & fish ponds with lizards, frogs. Like going to a zoo as well."
4,"The Grand Hyatt in Bali is an excellent all-around resort. The location is superb its, on the beach at Nusa Dua and that is a great section of beach, It is right across the road from Bali Collection.  Service is excellent - food choice from three restaurants just great.  Kids club is terrific and located in the ""village""  The Hotel is very spread out and totally surrounded by magnificent gardens and water features, it is a most tranquil and romantic setting yet kid friendly as well.  Totally recommended - much better than Mulia and much less expensive."
1,"Unfortunately I can't leave a comment with no stars at all!  Don't ruin your vacation and waste your money by staying here  I honestly don't know from where I should start, but let's do it one by one so others can know what to expect and NOT BOOK this hotel  1- CHECK IN We came at 4:20, checking in suppose to be at 2 rooms were not ready waited for almost 1 hour  2- ROOM We came to our rooms late as they were cleaning them to find; old greetings card under bed covers, so most probably they didn't change the bed just fix it! and the whole bed frame was covered with dust and hair, in the bathroom we found a folded towel for us to use with STOOL on it! yes STOOL in a 5 stars hotel!!! Then the new room that we went to had BLOOD stains on the bed sheets! looked like period blood!!! …"
5,"We just arrived at Grand Hyatt located in Nusa dua Bali, and we received a gift for our anniversary from them💐 Thank to the hotel management  🙏🏻 My wife and I enjoy the pleasant environment and kind people."
5,This was our sixth visit in twenty years and we will be back in two years time. I read other reviews and wonder on what planet some people live. The room was clean and well furbished and we had a good view over the grounds and sea. Some aspects of the physical building are beginning to show their age but the grounds have to be the most beautiful of any hotel I have stayed in. All the staff from the check-in to restaurants and from the cleaners to the grounds people are some of the friendliest people I have met. This is despite the bad behaviour and crass ignorance of some of our fellow guests.

4,"We stayed here for 8 nights on a Luxury Escapes package. The hotel grounds are beautiful and well kept. There was a lot of wildlife including squirrels and monitor lizards which my 7 year old found fascinating. The breakfast at the Garden Cafe was excellent with an amazing choice. We made good use of the vouchers for meals in the other restaurants.  They definitely saved us a lot of money as the hotel restaurants are very expensive by the time tax and service charge is added on.  Unfortunately the swimming pool was closed on our last day as it was green.  The only downside for us was the bus loads of Chinese tourists coming to the hotel each day. They seemed to be on some kind of day trip and had clearly never seen a pool or beach before. They were very loud and rude, taking…"
3,"Pros: - Beautiful property and landscaping - Friendly and helpful staff. Prompt response to requests for assistance - Clean and comfortable rooms, though not spotless (dust bunnies under the bed, and the room phone needed a serious wipe down)  Cons: - Room felt pretty dated and in need of a facelift - Soundproofing in room could be better - Large groups of Chinese tourists can be pretty noisy at times (no fault of the hotel's, but could impact someone's stay if they were looking for peace and quiet)  We stayed for 3 nights at the east block close to the beach. One morning at 8am I wanted to enjoy some morning solitude and do some reading, but my plan was completely ruined by loud electronic music and shouts/laughter/loud voices coming from the resort next door. Not sure if this…"
3,"Before I get into the review of this hotel I would like to say that the friendliest and service provided by the staff was exemplary under very trying conditions. Unfortunately, I found very few other positives about the Grand Hyatt.  The hotel is overpriced, overrated and past its use by date. The hotel is nearly thirty years old and is showing its age. The rooms are outdated and are in urgent need of renovation. Also, the buildings and pools require a great deal of maintenance and the gardens and trees are overgrown requiring a complete overhaul.  There are a number of pools located on the property but all appeared to be poorly maintained. The water is cloudy and appears to have inadequate filtration. Green mould is visible on tiles and around the step areas. Many of the pool…"
1,"My advise is to avoid this hotel. Normally my travel agent gets it right but this place is 2 star at best!  Last 24 hours. Fridge not working so no cold drinks. Door broken which took 35 mins for someone to service the door which meant we missed our golf tee time. Japanese restaurant booked for the evening, on arrival told that half of it was closed due to maintenance so left for their Balinese option. Steak then cooked well done instead of medium rare.  Amongst all of those issues a totally lack of responsibility and we had to deal with 4 different duty managers who all did nothing to elevate the issues.  "
3,"I’ll put this into pros and cons. We didn’t hate or love this place and for that reason we wouldn’t stay again.   PROS:  ✖️Nice big pool  ✖️Fun slide for the kids ✖️Club executive room was decent. Not amazing but nice.  ✖️Teppenyaki restaurant did a good job.  ✖️Beautiful beach.   CONS:  ✖️The charge you for the kids club. I REPEAT, they charge you for the kids club. What genius came up with that? All the competitors provide a great complimentary kids club option but Grand Hyatt think they should charge for it.  ✖️Bad customer service. Not always but the culture of this business seems to a bit miserable.  ✖️So many staff but you can’t seem to find them.  ✖️They tried to limit us to the Club Lounge for breakfast and staff blatantly lied that it offered the same food as the normal…"

5,"We stayed here on a Luxury Escapes voucher for 8 nights. We had upgraded to the Emerald pool room and were very happy with our room overlooking the Balinese Feature pool- room 1136. The first night our shower was not draining and the bathroom flooded but reported it and it was sorted out very quickly. The staff were so friendly and always very helpful, especially the lovely ladies at the customer service desk. The booklet of vouchers we received were great- all the meals we had were excellent and the nightly cocktails at the Salsa bar were very welcome! We loved the pools- water aerobics at 11am was good fun! Bali  Collection shops are right over the road. Overall we loved this hotel! "
5,"A wonderful hotel situated in the best location. Has a private beach, huge pool, lots of restaurants and even near a mall! If you’re looking to get away from work and away from home. This is the place to go! When we arrived, it was so nice that they acknowledged it was our 1 year anniversary and we had a nice card in our room. The rooms are soo spacious and cosy with a very nice view of the garden. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. I would like to name a few staff who were exceptional and deserves some praise. Yunim and Tegun from front desk and Roro, Yuni and MD Sukasih from breakfast. They always remembered us and assisted us when we needed and were always smiling.  "
3,"Staff are great from start to finish.  The hotel grounds are excellent but the rooms are showing signs of being tired.  The hotel lacks pizazz when compared with others at Nusa Dusa for a little more.  Beef Rendang at Garden Café was unacceptably tough. The following night Beef Tenderloin at the Garden Café was inedible. A couple of nights later at the upmarket Japanese restaurant I left  a third of my beef on the plate. The beef was tough. In our opinion the hotel needs to upgrade  the quality of the beef purchased. Otherwise the food is up to Bali 4+ standard.  If we had no alternative  we would return in a flash. Regrettably, there are alternatives ,and Bali accommodation is discounting heavily.  Prices are Bali 4+ standard. "
5,"Stayed here about last year, this review is a bit late but the memory will last forever. Will never forget. !! Everything are beautiful, from the front entrance to the hotel (ground) to every corner of the premises is miraculously beautiful.  The beach, the pool, the room, the garden the people. Everything!! All just unforgettably beautiful.  We stayed for 4nites 5days just was not enough. Wish we were stayed longer. We tried 2 (from three) restaurant for breakfast, all were nice. We also had the chance to dine in the Italian and main dining room, beautiful!!! Our little girl spent sometime in the kids club. Due to be only 2 children at that time she was a bit bored after sometimes but the carer there were trying their best to make it fun (they even made some bracelet for her to…"
5,"This place definitely did not disappoint!! We are actually still here and have only four days left and it’s going to be hard to let go.  The resort is unbelievable and what’s more is the service we have received from every single employee that we have come across.  Nothing has been too much trouble, always a friendly greeting from the bar staff to the gardeners.  The biggest problem we had was trying to keep up with the kids, our 6 year old and 20 month old, they just didn’t stop! From the swimming pools to the beach to looking at all the fish in the foyer, the experience has been magnificent.  We’ve stayed at 5 star resorts in Fiji, Vanuatu, Cook Islands but this place takes the cake.  The food has more than delivered on expectations and the Salsa bar just blew us away. …"

4,We arrived in time for a late lunch. The entrance to the Nusa Dua resorts area is amazing. You drive along miles of untidy shops and buildings. Then you pass through the gates and into a different world. Magnificent gardens and huge resorts which have all the facilities to be self contained or the option to wander or shop right outside the door of the resort. Security is very present for vehicles entering the resort. On arrival we were offered a cool drink and shown to our rooms. We had 15 people in our group and all rooms had a lagoon outlook. Generous rooms with king beds. Great bathrooms with dressing room and safe. We had children and adults in the group. All were catered for extremely well. The three gluten sensitive people were catered for well except for one evening when…
3,"My husband and I with our 2 grandchildren stayed at this hotel as part of a luxury escape package.  The luxury escape included drink vouchers for 2 cocktails each night.  We used these one night at the Indonesia buffet, they were accepted and we had 2 drinks but paid for 2 for the kids. When we checked out the drinks we had were charged on our account with the receptionist saying you could not redeem the voucher at this dinner.  I advised the staff had accepted the voucher.  She did not believe this and I spent probably 30 mins while she checked  and merely said you cannot use the voucher at this restaurant and basically reused to believe it had been accepted by the waiter.

3,"Fab hotel, staff are lovely and the grounds are majestic, truly faultless! the only thing that lets this hotel down was the state of the room.  Our room desperately needed a refresh, the plug in the sink was broken, paint peeling off around the vanity unit but the air-conditioning air intake filter was clogged with dust, someone has propped the filter up with a hotel pencil to allow more air to pass, but alas our room never got below 27 degrees even at night which whilst better than outside was still just too hot. The Balcony door has a trip on it to stop the air con when the door is open, but this is wasted TBH as you could limbo dance under the gap around all the doors, closing this would give the air conditioning a chance.

5,"We stayed in the suite and it was amazing, we   really like the balcony views, our favorite plaace   was the Balinese pool. We enjoyed their spa and   the buffet restaurant at night including local   show and acting. The property is very beautiful   and huge. So many plans to do in Grand Hyatt."
5,"Just came back from a fabulous stay at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua Bali. The staff are always smiling and forever at your service. The room was spotlessly clean and large, with bed and pillows like home. The grounds are perfectly looked after, and being a little bit older are more established. The food at the restaurants are expensive for Bali standards but very reasonable for western standards. The pools are great and you can find a quiet pool in the complex ( we chose the Balinese feature pool), all in all we left relaxed and felt happy with the money spent.  It's our first time using the Hyatt chain, but have already booked the Hyatt in Dubai in July, which I hope can meet the high standards of the Grand Hyatt Bali"
5,"Our recent stay with Grand Hyatt Bali was awesome! The staff are all very welcoming, and we enjoyed pleasant interactions with some lovely staff members. The tour desk was very accommodating to our requests, hence we enjoyed the tours we really wanted to do. The food is excellent, and a variety to suit all tastes. We never had a bad meal! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to get away and relax, but take in what the island has to offer."
4,"Stayed 3 nights in a Grand Executive Suite King. This hotel is perfect for some peace and quiet, away from the otherwise very busy and crowded areas in Kuta and surroundings. Very friendly staff, clean and luxurious room, clean beach. Large pool area and plenty of sunbeds on the beach (did not experience shortage).   The grand club lounge offers delicious appetisers in the afternoon and a very relaxing atmosphere (gain access by staying in executive rooms or Globalist status).  Drawbacks: quality of sunbeds low compared to the other resorts along the same beach. Renting surfboards from the hotel’s surf shop is ridiculously expensive. The price is IDR 390k for 1 hour. You can rent the exact same board from the local surf shop – located next door to the hotel - for IDR 150k for 2…"
2,"We stayed at the grand Hyatt Bali for a week with our 2 kids and it was lovely. The grounds were immaculate and maintained all the time. The pool was lovely as it had a water slide and the kids loved it. Breakfast was fantastic and it catered for everyone. The staff were all beautiful and happy to help with anything. The only down side is the rooms. Walls are paper thin where we could hear the person in the room above go to the toilet in the middle of the night, also we could hear the people in the room next doors conversations where I think they may have wanted to keep them private. Maybe they need to consider making some improvements to the rooms as they look like they haven’t been upgraded since they’ve been built. Would we go to nusa dua again? Um maybe not as Bali has many…"
5,"We stayed in the suite and it was amazing, we   really like the balcony views, our favorite plaace   was the Balinese pool. We enjoyed their spa and   the buffet restaurant at night including local   show and acting. The property is very beautiful   and huge. So many plans to do in Grand Hyatt."
5,"Just came back from a fabulous stay at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua Bali. The staff are always smiling and forever at your service. The room was spotlessly clean and large, with bed and pillows like home. The grounds are perfectly looked after, and being a little bit older are more established. The food at the restaurants are expensive for Bali standards but very reasonable for western standards. The pools are great and you can find a quiet pool in the complex ( we chose the Balinese feature pool), all in all we left relaxed and felt happy with the money spent.  It's our first time using the Hyatt chain, but have already booked the Hyatt in Dubai in July, which I hope can meet the high standards of the Grand Hyatt Bali"
5,"Our recent stay with Grand Hyatt Bali was awesome! The staff are all very welcoming, and we enjoyed pleasant interactions with some lovely staff members. The tour desk was very accommodating to our requests, hence we enjoyed the tours we really wanted to do. The food is excellent, and a variety to suit all tastes. We never had a bad meal! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to get away and relax, but take in what the island has to offer."
4,"Stayed 3 nights in a Grand Executive Suite King. This hotel is perfect for some peace and quiet, away from the otherwise very busy and crowded areas in Kuta and surroundings. Very friendly staff, clean and luxurious room, clean beach. Large pool area and plenty of sunbeds on the beach (did not experience shortage).   The grand club lounge offers delicious appetisers in the afternoon and a very relaxing atmosphere (gain access by staying in executive rooms or Globalist status).

5,"Me and my friends went to Bali for holiday on August 2017. And we stayed at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. Its a beautiful and perfect place.   Excellent property ..beautiful sea facing rooms , made our stay quite wonderful and grand. Excellent room service even at odd hours in the night was a bonus for our entire group.  What i most liked was the breakfast spread starting from exotic fruits to an array of different breads they had it all."
5,"To complete our tour of Bali we spent 7 days at the Grand Hyatt. Impressive reception with views over gardens to the ocean. The hotel staff paid careful attention to the cleanliness of the hotel, beach and gardens (a big improvement after the shabbiness of the Gili islands). We upgraded to a Grand Club room which gave us access to the Club pavilion - this saved us a lot of money on food and drinks. Good sized room with a good quality finish. Plenty to do in resort, and shopping across the road. "
4," Overall a nice holiday, the room was clean, the bed very comfortable, we enjoyed the italian restaurant , we didn’t have breakfast , we ate few times at Bali Colection , our son 8 didn’t  like the kids club, the beach was nice , they were cleaning every day, the water not so clean !"
3,"We came to Grand Hyatt Bali straight from Grand Hyatt Singapore and we felt huge difference.   Breakfast - very limited selection with no fresh juices.  Kids club - you have to pay for it.  Room service - was a bit slow, you get your room made in the afternoon instead of morning. Well, it was peak season however it’s not Hyatt standard.  On the other hand location and hotel itself is really nice with huge pool."
1,"Have been coming back to Bali for several times but never stayed in Grand Hyatt, thought of giving it a try after reading some reviews. Though have some doubts as I know this hotel has been there for so long, could have some maintenance issues etc - but giving the benefit of the doubt as I trust the global brand name should carry the high international standards.   And boy, what a big mistake!!! Our first night was truly a big disaster!!! The room was dusty, looks very old, dark and dirty. Worst part, the AC not working properly. It was already 10 pm when we got back from our dinner and I immediately called and raised complain. They sent the engineering guy who then tried to fix the air cond. for almost an hour - but no luck as it was totally broken. By 11 pm, the duty manager…"

5,"One expects a certain standard when staying at a resort such as Grand Hyatt Bali. Yet, it is those little details that make your stay either nice or absolutely perfect. I loved the impecable resort grounds and landscape, its pools and oh! what a beach! Service and staff was absolutely superior. Just as an example a real treat from Angela in Veranda lounge makes even a simple sip of ice tea special."
5,"It was our first trip to Bali,we stayed there for 4 days,i think 4 days are not enough to visit every where in Bali. The hotel was perfect,it is a great location in Nusa dua, we enjoyed alot .overall I will travel to Bali again "
5,"We recently had a 6 night stay in a Club room at the Grand Hyatt. Driving into the massive complex you immediately feel that you have entered a quality older property that has the most beautiful manicured grounds.  We were immediately escorted through the main reception straight down to the Grand Club area where we were checked in by very pleasant staff and without all the normal waiting around that normally comes with a hotel of this size. Our room was very large and well appointed and although showing its age a little bit was very quiet and comfortable. Pool was excellent, access to the beach convenient and Club benefits exceptional also really easy access to the Bali Collection shopping area. Special mention must be made of the staff and how welcome they made us feel for the…"
5,"Everything about this hotel/ resort is amazing....great location, ultra friendly staff and superb service.  Rooms are a little jaded and could do with upgrades but overall no complaints...  We had several dinners since I was there part of a large conference and all of them were flawless...especially loved the barbecue on the beach...great cuts of meat and fantastic service and ambience..."
4,"This was my first trip to Bali, staying 8 days. I loved it here, the rooms are lovely and big, they are clean and I couldn’t find fault with anything.  The only slight downside is busloads of people came through the resort most days to get to the beach, walking through the pool area to get to the beach. They were loud and noisy, but that didn’t spoil my holiday, it was just an irritation in the midst of a nice relaxing time by the pool. You can also join in he daily aqua aerobics sessions which were fun.  The food was great.  I am unable to select the radio buttons below for cleanliness, value and service, so I’ll say these were all excellent."

3,"I stayed in the resort for several days for a business conference. It is a great location in Nusa Dua , with beautiful gardens - lush manicured vegetation. Rooms are spacious but might soon need a face lift , it is not posh design, but rather classic - aged style but basics are there - good view overlooking green terraces, balcony’ relaxation “divan”, everything is there but somewhat not fully polished. The biggest limitation is the beach, it looks beautiful but with the tide you can not swim- you need to walk 200 m’s into the sea and it is not a pleasant walk.  Food is standard what you can expect from a G Hyatt with International prices, you need to also note that the Nusa Dua is a touristic contained area with few resorts and other facilities ‘developed’ in a secure area, it…"
5,"Amazing hotel whit great service and architecture, decoration. Big, clean rooms whit small lake in the middle whit a lots of fishes. Beautiful beaches near by, two great restaurants, bar in the complex. Amazing experience!  Hope to come back again! : *"
1,"Let me set the stage for my review.  This was our fourth stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali.  My first review that I wrote when we stay the first time was titled ""Fantastic place to stay"".  I gave the resort 5 stars and I wrote about how wonderful it was.  At that time, everything worked.  It was a great place to stay.    We just went for our fourth stay.  Until the end of February I was in the highest Hyatt club, a Globalist.  We had two Regency Club rooms.  One we were paying for, the other was free using my points.  So we had incentive to stay there, plus our long history with the resort.  But it was a disaster!  Where did the Grand Hyatt Bali, that we so loved and cherished go?  I won't get into the specifics.  What I will say is that I tried talking with the various duty…"
3,"Room was not good enough. It was located far from the entrance. So many insects were in the room. Almost has no lobby. Overall, it was not a good hotel compared to many other Hyatt hotel I have seen before."
5,We just got back from the grand Hyatt & it is an absolute must visit! We loved every minute of it. The staff are absolutely amazing! The resort is beautiful and so well maintained. Pools are fantastic & the food is excellent!  I give the staff a 10/10 they made our stay so enjoyable - we are already booking our next trip back!!!! All the staff were great but a special thanks to Dewi from the garden cafe breakfast room who was just incredible her service is amazing. & Eka from salsa verde restaurant - 10/10 to both of them! Thank you grand Hyatt for a truly 5 star experience. A MUST VISIT ! :)

5,"This hotel has beautiful gardens and is right on the beach. There is someone here for everyone, from doing nothing by pool to jet skiing or tennis. The Kriya Spa is a must during your stay. The hotel staff are amazing. We've stayed here several times and will be back."
1,"Seriously Grand Hyatt Bali sort this out - Overpriced rip-off cocktails at the lobby bar. We don't mind paying London or Tokyo prices for cocktails if they are any good but come on -  a shockingly tiny amount, all for a 5 star hotel price-tag i.e same price as Rock bar at Ayana (Which were great)  The hotel needs a full make over and sort out the above to make it great again. Its a shadow of its former self - 15 years ago Grand Hyatt was excellent, today its a budget hotel with 5 star prices and a great looking lobby."
5,"Just finished our memorable 8 days luxuryescape Bali package. We are extremely satisfied with the stay in the resort. Unlike other resorts we found the staffs at all levels are very very helpful, sincere and cheerful, in particular Armi, Sokasih and Yumi are the Garden Cafe.   The hotel rooms are a bit jaded but we were not bothered by it. The meals and drinks in the resorts are excellent esp the enormous spread at the Balinese night dinner. I just only managed to saviour half of it.     To us it was 8 days of living with nature. The fishes in the pond, the birds, squirrels and the monitor lizards provided us with daily entertainment.   Love this place and would definitely recommended to anyone. It was also our first time using Luxuryescapes and will definitely use them again."
5,"Returned to the Grand Hyatt after more than 10 years and it was still as beautiful as on my previous visits many years ago. The vast colourful exotic gardens, too many to count water features and multiple swimming pools were the highlights of our stay. Paying the extra for a Grand Club room/access is well worthwhile.  I won't leave it 10 years for my next visit - it is only the 18 hour journey from London that will delay me,"
5,"As a globalist I have had the opportunity to stay in many Hyatt’s.  This one is the best by far   Superb staff, location and layout   A special thanks to me Urip the grand club manager. Sensational customer service by him and his team  I don’t normally return to the same place, but I may have to break that tradition this time  Just go and stay there , and the one star review below?? Unbelievable, and maybe got the hotel name wrong in his review as this hotel is perfect for couples. Singles, families, anyone can have a great time here due to facilities and the staff"

5,This hotel has elegance coupled with a relaxed ambience right on the beach The grounds and pool areas are superbly conditioned and cared for What sets this hotel apart is the wonderful staff drawn from Hindu and Buddhist origins.  They could have been more welcoming and I challenge fellow travelers to find a more complete group of staff in any hotel worldwide   I will be back 
5,I have been a loyal Hyatt resident around the world for 30 years and I can honestly say this is the most complete Hyatt experience ever. The property with huge beachfront amazing. The overall grounds were beautiful and serene.The room accommodations and the Grand Club experience were fabulous. The overall quality of the staff around the entire property were the best I ever experienced. Each and everyone would greet you with a hello and a warm smile. The food venues on property were very good in particular Salsa Verde for surprisingly great Italian food. We can not wait to return to this magical property and highly recommend.
5,"We booked through Luxury Escapes and couldn't be happier. All inclusions were first class from the room, the massages, evening cocktails, breakfasts lunch and dinners. The location of the hotel is fantastic with over 600 metres of clean beachfront to explore on shaded lounges spaced all along the frontage allowing for as much privacy as you want.The same can be said for the plentiful pool lounges spread around all pools offering sun or shade according to your preference. The staff are friendly and extremely accommodating. A special mention to Rai at the Salsa Verde rooftop bar who was a wealth of knowledge on the area and was always happy and keen to make sure our visits were top knotch, however all staff deserve praise and recognition,,,I wish I could name all we dealt with.…"

4,"We have just completed an 8 night stay at the Grand Hyatt on a Luxury Escapes deal.  Firstly this is a beautiful hotel. Yes the rooms are a bit on the old side, but the gardens and pools are amazing. There was always shade and the kids loved the waterslide.   Breakfast was fantastic and the staff were so welcoming each day and got to know our coffee orders which was a nice touch!  Our deal included set dinners at the Italian and the cafe, both were ok but the stand out was the Indonesian buffet show - we were very impressed with the food selection and the satays were some of the best we have eaten, as were the salads!!!  We would like to encourage management to consider reviewing the kids menu.... it was ok, but was the same in all 4 restaurants - making the choice very limited…"

The grounds are huge, at the start of our stay it was quite confusing to get around but by the end it was no problem. We had a Luxury escapes package with extra benefits like massage (absolutely amazing) and lunches/dinners which Included the buffet dinner show...this was a fantastic night and worth going to just to see their buffet set up. Our room was a little tired, but we were in the lowest level rooms and it was very clean and spacious.  As others mentioned somewhere to dry out your clothes is the only fault I can think of. The beach at the front is beautiful and we were able to swim with children without any problem at mid tides.  Had a bit of a…"
5,"We have just spent 8 nights at the Grand Hyatt in Bali and were very happy with the whole luxury escapes deal.   The resort is very large, and set right on the beach in Nusa Dua and opposite Bali Collection Shopping centre.  The rooms were large Balinese style and very clean.   The pools were very big and kept lovely and clean too.  All of the Restaurants were also exceptionally clean and there was not one complaint about the food.  As we had a baby travelling with us the Chefs were very happy to make her anything we needed.  I would recommend to families (especially those with kids up to say 10 yrs old as they would love the pools and you wouldn't have to leave the hotel if you didn't want to).  The Hotel was running at only 50% occupancy, which suited us fine, although they…"

4,"The hotel is old but perfect for holiday in Bali, located at Nusa Dua and beach side . First impression at the lobby was unforgettable especially with koi fish in the pool and cute lizards was walking. This hotel really nice for Family even couple is better, would love to come back :)"
1,I arrived at Grand Hyatt Bali on 15/03/2018 with a family group.   Upon arrival the hotel looked great and lived up to my initial expectations. Soon after check-in it will all went down hill. Our rooms firstly were not ready as per check in time. The family group were then given rooms as they became ready even after the allocated check in time. Not to mention that the hotel were given plenty of notice that a group were arriving on this date.   These things happen and are accepted when the hotel accepts they have failed to deliver however on this occasion Grand Hyatt seem to think this is all ok as there was no clear acknowledgement.   Once we had our rooms the luggage remained at the front of the hotel and was delivered an hour late. I have a young baby where we needed her…

4,"The hotel is old but perfect for holiday in Bali, located at Nusa Dua and beach side . First impression at the lobby was unforgettable especially with koi fish in the pool and cute lizards was walking. This hotel really nice for Family even couple is better, would love to come back :)"
1,I arrived at Grand Hyatt Bali on 15/03/2018 with a family group.   Upon arrival the hotel looked great and lived up to my initial expectations. Soon after check-in it will all went down hill. Our rooms firstly were not ready as per check in time. The family group were then given rooms as they became ready even after the allocated check in time. Not to mention that the hotel were given plenty of notice that a group were arriving on this date.   These things happen and are accepted when the hotel accepts they have failed to deliver however on this occasion Grand Hyatt seem to think this is all ok as there was no clear acknowledgement.   Once we had our rooms the luggage remained at the front of the hotel and was delivered an hour late. I have a young baby where we needed her…
5,"We stayed here as part of an eight night Luxury Escapes package and absolutely adored every minute of it. The grounds, buildings and beach definitely have the WOW factor and the staff are attentive and charming. They can't do enough to make sure your visit goes smoothly. Everyone seems happy and excited to be working here and the customer service is superb. Our package included meals and everything was wonderful, but the standout was the Italian restaurant in the grounds, Salsa Verde. This place is so beautiful I think we spent the first 24 hours just oohing and aahing over everything!!! We can't wait to come back again!!"
4,"The property is immaculate! From the rooms, gardens to the beach. The staff is exceptionally friendly and always have a smile! My daughter and I got sick but they were very accommodating and helpful! Overall a wonderful place to stay!"
4,"Stayed here with a young family (2 and 8) and we loved it overall. Great staff and service everywhere we went around the resort, stunning grounds, superbly manicured gardens, awesome pools and waterslide for the kids, proximity to the beach and walkway and shops was great. Negatives would be the beach in front of the resort is not the best as the water is too far away. Nearby hotels like ayodya have a far nicer beach, but not as nice grounds and pools. Room was a bit outdated but clean and large. It did however lack storage and clothes dryer. Drinks are overpriced. Overall we recommend it. Nusa dua is stunning and the hotel is located in the high end area if you like your comfort whilst still getting a feel for the Balinese culture. "
5,"Having been to Bali many times and especially Nusa Dua I expected to find the Grand Hyatt similar to other five star resorts but was pleasantly surprised with the differences the Grand Hyatt offered during a recent 8 day Luxury Escape holiday. Even taking the extras out provided as part of the package the resort was the best we have yet seen anywhere in Bali especially on the beachfront. Whilst the resort has it all in terms of brand, location, restaurants, relaxation and facilities what sets the resort apart is the service levels and the staff at all levels and in all areas of the resort at any time of day or night. Great breakfasts, a little different everyday, huge choice of eating options and lots of space to enjoy the pools or beach or recreational activities inside and…"
5,I’m stay here for 3 nights. It’s a good place for charge myself with a lot of energy!  Staff are very helpful with everything also nice and very friendly. Pool bar is very quick service and taste is not bad. Definitely come back next time 💕

4,"Arrived in Nusa Dua for 3 days after a 3 day stay in Ubud and what a contrast. I just felt something was missing, there didn’t seem to be a vibe about the area. It was very nice don’t get me wrong, but the hotel just lacked personality.   The Grand Hyatt is a huge resort and a beautiful beach right on its door step. It is ideal for families. Plenty of sun loungers and pools to choose from. The breakfast buffet was very nice with plenty to choose from. We visited the salsa restaurant for lunch and it was by far one of the most expensive meals we had whilst in Bali and the food was good, not exactly excellent. We didn’t try any other of the restaurants as we were put off by the price of the Italian restaurant.   We ate most days in the Bali collection area, again a place where we…"
1,stayed for two nights. service in below average. interiors are very old . hotel badly needs make over. over expensive not worth . Except beachfront part nothing is worth. repenting on not choosing another better options.
3,"Stayed there for 3 nights during conference. The hotel staff is very friendly, the food just OK, nothing special.  The beach is awesome.   The only problem is the room, my room is a bit dirty, the floor is a bit sticky and there are some kind of sands in several spot of my room (I think there’s  termite in the wood ornaments of my room). The window blinds is dusty and dirty.  The Aircon in my room keeps going on an off the whole day (the noise is wuite disturbing), and on the 2nd day water star dripping from the ceiling of my bath room. I must called the housekeeping twice to clean it.  Other than the room, I got nothing to complain.  "
4,It is a typical international Hotel with helpful international staffs on site. Beautiful tropical gardens surrounds.   Easy to get lost the way back to the room especially at night time. Better to have a map on hand.  Breakfast and lunch at garden cafe is the best option.   Take times to enjoy the calm and moderate waves beach in Nusa Dua.   
5,"We've kind of made it a tradition to treat ourselves at the GHB after our diving trips at Indonesia. After 2-3 solid weeks of diving, a nice relaxing stay is exactly what we need and it's exactly what we got. The grounds are beautiful and the hotel has a very nice private beach (plus 5 pools if you don't want to go into the ocean itself). GHB is located at Nusa Dua. For those who haven't been to Bali or Nusa Dua before, the area is sort of an enclave of 5-star resorts--it's its own little community with a hospital, shops, restaurants, etc so that if you don't want to leave, you don't have to.   We got the Grand Club package--you get breakfast included, drinks and cookies throughout the day, and free alcohol drinks from 5-7pm with plenty of hor'douvres.    GHB is about a 20-25…"

5,Stayed in club room garden view. Clean room and facilities. Very nice breakfast and late afternoon service in a dedicated area. The garden is breathtaking and very well maintained. Several pools. Enough chairs with towels are available. Same at the nice and clean beach. Plenty of shaded areas. Staff was extremely polite. 
4,"The hotel itself was perfect from the amazing spread at breakfast to the private beach and spotless rooms and amenities. I had no issues and  was very happy with the facilities. However, its location is really far from a lot of the attraction and nightlife/going out which seems to be in Seminyak which would take us an hour or so because of traffic. However, I believe all the big resorts are in this area because if you need a place that can accommodate a big group/conference/etc. you need space so hence there is trade-off it isn't as close. Thus next time, we would probably stay in Seminyak if we had a smaller group just because we felt like we wasted a lot of time commuting but if you're looking to hangout and relax at the resort, this is a great option"
4,"Very nice hotel, good service and location.  I like this hotel, but, probably, won't come back, because I found that the next door Inaya Putri Resort has the same rooms, service and better beach for the half of the price! The breakfast in Hyatt is $40, but there is nothing for this price, basic stuff only.  The pork is good,but it's too heavy for breakfast and a lot of people don't eat pork for different reasons, so it'll be good to change it for chicken.  This breakfast is OK for $20 - $25 only, but definitely not $40! I've heard other people complains on the breakfast variety."
5,"Upon our arrival to the property, we were promptly greeted by warm staff. Escorted to the Grand Club and cheeked in by such friendly people…. refreshing cool tropical drink and towel. Within just a few minutes, we were walked to our club suite. The gracious host reviewed the room amenities and hotel’s facilities. Through our stay, the hotel amazed. It’s a large property…beach facilities were well maintained and immaculate. Several pools available for all different needs/moods. Warm friendly service was found throughout the resort. Several amazing food choices on site. The breakfast and evening Club meals were wonderful, changed every day and were so enticing it was difficult to venture away and not see what the next days menu would bring. We were never disappointed. I can’t say…"
4,"I stayed at Grand Hyatt with friends for 3 days . Major improvements in food quality and a great japanese dinner. Service still is a struggle with this hotel. You always need to look for staff when you need something. Rooms are good, we were along way away from anything but it was good exercise . A nice stay"

3,"Beautiful grounds. Direct beach access. We stayed in an Oceanview room which had a great view of the beach/ocean. Lots of pool options. Check in was great. Staff are very friendly and helpful.  The food:   buffet breakfast for 1 person was 410,000 IDR. The buffet was very average with nothing out of the ordinary. This price is completely insane. My wife and I paid around the same price for dinner for 2 people at Salsa Verde.   We had lunch at the garden Cafe. I had the black pepper prawns (around 200,000 idr) and my wife had the gado gado (105,000 idr). The food was disappointing. Warm fresh watermelon juice (75,000 idr) was also a big miss.   Dinner at Salsa Verde was good and reasonably priced. Can't say the same for Cocktails which were around 110,000 idr.   I understand that…"
2,I was there in OCT.2017 . it wasn't as good as you see in the picture . just too big to walk with a large beach . but you can not use the ocean because everywhere they have yellow and red flag . all the staff in the room was too old . even they don't have anything in the room that you can dry you swimsuit after using the pool . it was really rediculous I think . the room service was too weak . the did not put a towel in front of bath. everything was so expensive in the hotel especially the restaurant and the foods . and too many other things .
3,"I recently spent a week at the Hyatt with a friend, celebrating a milestone birthday . We took advantage of a Luxury Escape deal. A very well priced deal.  The hotel is positioned in a beautiful part of Nusa Dua. The beach is pristine and the ocean spectacular. The hotel grounds are fabulous. There are really only 2 pools for most guests. Both pools are nice, however both dating and needing upgrades, along with pool furniture.  Our room was on the ground floor. We were really happy with the position of our room. We had a glimpse of the beach and could walk out our door and stroll around.  Our room was dated and needed a refurb. Maybe Luxury Escape visitors are giving more basic rooms. For what we paid it was adequate.  The house keeping of our room was exceptional. It was…"
5,"The resort is beautiful and is on a 40+ acre site. Its been around for 25 years, and the gardens and trees show how well the hotel surroundings have been kept. You get a very relaxed feel when you arrive at the hotel. Because its a large resort, you may want to consider staying at the hotel wings that are closer to the beach.  The rooms have been kept well. The hotel may be 25 years old but the rooms have been maintained well. It definitely does not have a new trendy hotel room feel, but rather a comfortable and spacious feel. top marks for housekeeping as well as the front desk office.  The hotel has several pools and a small water slide. Its great for the family and is right in front of the beach. There is also a pool further in the hotel. Its secluded and perfect for couples…"
5,"I must say, this place is one of the greenest place in Indonesia. Great staff, nice food, huge property. In fact a walk of 700-800m to reach my room was a daily routine for me. Loved 3 days at this hotel. A must visit for all."

The beech is amazing and cleaned every morning ,the pools are great with lovely shade from the trees with squirels playing above you . With this location your just a short 2min walk to Bali collection, and the resort also puts on lovely tours  Housekeeping staff do an excellent job.,but some points in the room could do with some maintenance. Breakfast is good ,but the only thing that lets it down is the orange juice.you have to stand for five minutes to get it to pour into your glass .every morning the same only filled 50mm above tap at any one time. . This is an easy fix grand Hyatt fill it to the top."
4,"Had a fabulous stay!! We were made to feel welcome every day. The staff couldn't do enough to make sure people are happy, satisfied & relaxed.... If you want sanctuary this is definitely the place to do it. Food was magnificent, breakfast lunch & dinner!!  However it is a huge property, too big for our liking.... "
3,"Being Globalist members, we always like coming to this property - namely because of the expansive and well kept grounds with beachfront access to boot. A lot hasnt changed since our last stay and breakfast service is still one area mgt needs to focus (esp at Garden Cafe) Most of the staff in accordance to local friendly culture are nice, helpful and friendly but not overtly and some can be very curt (maybe due to the voluminous amount of Chinese travellers that they treat all Asians the same shoddy service). Its an ok stay but it feels less and less at home and a 5 star hotel - one expects more!"
4,"We travelled to Bali end of January 2018 with another couple and stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 9 nights. Grand Hyatt is situated in Nusa Dua ('second island'). It is in a gated community housing many other 4-5* hotels. Security is very tight-every car/taxi entering the area is checked and checked again by the hotel staff.  Whilst I appreciate other writer's comments about the hotel being a bit dated, I found the hotel to be clean and very well maintained by an army of dedicated staff.  The rooms were spacious and I think all of them overlook a water feature from the balcony-our room overlooked the Balinese Spa pool.

Hotel served nice and quality food. Within the hotel compound have nice walk way, garden and water features, ideal for a slow walk in the morning and evening after meal.  The hotel is kind of far from the city, it may take you 1 - 130 hrs to travel to the nearby town, however, if you are too lazy to step out from your beautiful hotel, there is one large shopping area - Bali connection just right outside the hotel main door, just 5 mins walking and you are able to access to 80+ shop and restaurant plus a huge SOGO departmental store. Get ready to shop till you drop. this is…"

4,"The Grand Hyatt Nusa dua, Bali....is a phenomenal property. 70 acres of lush beautiful, on a private beach.....very grand indeed. Bang opposite the Bali collection....Nusa dua's upmarket shopping, eating complex. Locationally and otherwise superb. But underneath all this the lady is a little jaded. The rooms look dates and need some spit-polish and some re- modelling. Also all ocean view rooms are NOT ocean view. Don't take the ground floor rooms...you can only see a thin slice of ocean standing up! I was put into one of them, protested and the room was quickly changed......that was good, so was the check in process- warm and smooth. Can't say the same for the check out though.....the 10-15 Mon waiting could have been easily avoided has the hotel put in some planning into the…"
4,"My wife and I recently visited the Grand Hyatt Bali in Nusa Dua in Feb 2018.  We stayed in the Grand King Suite. The room was absolutely lovely and well appointed. We overlooked the Bali Pond filled with large Koi on the ground floor. All of the staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful and always pleased to see you.  We both enjoyed our stay there, but there were a couple of things that we wanted to mention that could possibly needs some attention.  I think that the buffet breakfast needs attention from the perspective of offering some quality food and not just a large spread of ordinary tasting food.   The hotel overall is feeling a little tired and we can see that there are some parts of the hotel requiring maintenance and patching and possibly more of a…"

The hotel is kind of far from the city, it may take you 1 - 130 hrs to travel to the nearby town, however, if you are too lazy to step out from your beautiful hotel, there is one large shopping area - Bali connection just right outside the hotel main door, just 5 mins walking and you are able to access to 80+ shop and restaurant plus a huge SOGO departmental store. Get ready to shop till you drop. this is…"
5,"We stayed in this hotel for one weak. I, my wife and my little son enjoyed the well-designed pools,  enormus breakfast and picturesque view of this garden-like resort. Staff were so polite and supportive and every thing were acceptable."
4,"The Grand Hyatt Nusa dua, Bali....is a phenomenal property. 70 acres of lush beautiful, on a private beach.....very grand indeed. Bang opposite the Bali collection....Nusa dua's upmarket shopping, eating complex. Locationally and otherwise superb. But underneath all this the lady is a little jaded. The rooms look dates and need some spit-polish and some re- modelling. Also all ocean view rooms are NOT ocean view. Don't take the ground floor rooms...you can only see a thin slice of ocean standing up! I was put into one of them, protested and the room was quickly changed......that was good, so was the check in process- warm and smooth. Can't say the same for the check out though.....the 10-15 Mon waiting could have been easily avoided has the hotel put in some planning into the…"
4,"My wife and I recently visited the Grand Hyatt Bali in Nusa Dua in Feb 2018.  We stayed in the Grand King Suite. The room was absolutely lovely and well appointed. We overlooked the Bali Pond filled with large Koi on the ground floor. All of the staff at the hotel were all very friendly and helpful and always pleased to see you.  We both enjoyed our stay there, but there were a couple of things that we wanted to mention that could possibly needs some attention.  I think that the buffet breakfast needs attention from the perspective of offering some quality food and not just a large spread of ordinary tasting food.   The hotel overall is feeling a little tired and we can see that there are some parts of the hotel requiring maintenance and patching and possibly more of a…"
3,"It was unexpected to enter beautiful  Grand Hyatt Lobby without any warm welcome from any staff at the entrance. I approach guest relations desk  to pass lost item for one of the guest in house , there were 3 persons behind  and only one European  Lady Staff GRO  at list gave me some attention, but again no thank you, no have a nice evening or something .  the other two not even smile or greet me at all, just were  continue looking at computer. Unpleasant and not nice  impression of Hospitality  such Luxury Brand."
5,"We find this Hyatt the most beautiful and luxurious.  Their pools are great and the beach is also nice. The staff are all so magnificent. We booked their club room and we got more than what we deserved. If the hotel wasn't full, we would have stayed longer. Kudos to the staff incharge of the club too. Definitely will try to ho back there again with my family. Our daughter couldnt get enough with their amenities and we enjoyed every moment there too."
4,"Staying a full week (5 days) in the hotel with most of the time spend in the ballroom and surrounding meeting rooms.  The resort sits on a huge ground and walking from one end of the resort to the other can easily take 10 mins or more. The surrounding gardens are very beautifully manicured, with ponds and water lilies everywhere. It adds to a very peaceful environment.  Checking in was not efficient. The front office took more than 20mins to check in the couple in front of me and I was “stucked” behind. Don’t know why?   The rooms are big and it’s nice to have an additional day bed. But the deco looks rather dated and will need to be refreshed. And one of the evening, i saw a cockroach crawling on the floor in the room. Pretty creepy!  Staying for 5 days with most meals taken in…"
4,Love the water slides and pools! Pool side service was a little slow but overall a very relaxing and enjoyable trip. Kids club staff are beautiful with the kids and the bunny rabbits are big hit! Lots of fun and a good mix between beach and resort space
4,"The resort in itself is magnificent. We were a family of 7 and it caters for people of all ages, and would be especially good for couples with younger children. Garden is kept impeccably well and we think the garden makes the Grand Hyatt, grand.   We got to try a few restaurants, the Italian one and Indonesian buffet - they were incredible.  Loved how you don’t really need to leave the Grand Hyatt as everything is there and even if you needed to Bali Collection was literally across the road. Spa was incredible.   However we were disappointed in the following:   -Extremely SLOW check in: our check in took 50 minutes. We travel a lot and never has a check in taken that long. When we tried to ask why it was taking so long we didn’t get an answer, just a smile. The receptionist that…"

4,"As a family we stayed at the Hyatt over the New Years period. We were lucky enough to have Club Rooms which allowed us to have breakfast and evening eats and drinks in the Club Lounge. The breakfast was described as Continental which doesn't excite my wife but on the first morning we discovered that you could have any type of eggs cooked to order! The snacks in the evening were also very nice and a good assortment was offred each night. Sadly Cocktails weren't included but the Bintangs, Gin and Tonics, Whisky etc went down very well. There are about five swimming pools which cater for everyone. There is one that is exclusively for Club Members, one for children, one for adults only and a couple of others for everyone. The grounds are so huge that you do need to be fit to walk…"
5,"This is our 4th visit to Bali over the last 6 years.  This is a our 1st time at this resort.  We arrived yesterday and can say the transfer from the airport to the hotel and then the welcome at the hotel reception to our suite was faultless and smooth.  Our room was a little disappointing with only a narrow view of the ocean.  We contacted the reception politely and have to compliment them for immediately taking steps to show us other options with complete courtesy.  We resettled into our 2nd room within an hour or so and have to say the follow up service, attention to detail and genuine efforts to please us has been so overwhelming.  We are regular travellers around the world and especially Asia at the 5 star level.  Yes like most of these resorts they are 10-15 years old and…"
4,"I stayed here 6 nights. The last visit to the Grand Hyatt was great. I even got an upgrade to the suite. This time I checked in, in the evening and was given an old room with stains in the mirror. The room suffered from damp and wet floors. The next day I complained about the room and got a much better room.  I liked the club lounge. They serve a lot of drinks (include wine and beer), although not real cocktails. they also had snacks during the day. Thew Women at the reception (like mrs Wiji) were very friendly.   The best part of the grand hyatt is the great beach and the great swimming pools. Also the lobby is nice. Always there were enough empty places at the beach.  The dinner show was disappointing with a show for 40 minutes, average food and a high price.  I did enjoy my…"
1,"This is most certainly the worst Grand Hyatt I have ever stayed in !! Everything about this property is most pathetic. Right from the staff, to the Quality of the Property.. everything is pathetic. It took one hour for us to check in and get our luggage in our rooms, Inspite of there not being even one guest at the check in counter. The front desk staff is rude and most inexperienced. They were fumbling with everything and lacked basic understanding of front desk duties. 6 staff members at the front desk and they struggled to check us in ! Luggage took 40 Minutes to reach the Room !! Rooms are most run down with smell. Flooring is in bad shape. Bathrooms are NOT clean. AC is not effective. Called the Hotel Manager to give feedback but he was not at all interested. He kept saying…"
4,"Me and my wife spent 6 nights in this location and it's almost like a perfect holiday!On the bright side you can't say enough good words about the location , cleanliness , security , rooms (although ""ocean-view' ones aren't exactly what you dreamed of!) and so on.Breakfast is nothing extraordinary but does the trick (except when it's raining - and it usually does in January - and you have to wait in line for a table with a roof above your head!) and you can chose between the Italian , Balinese or Japanese restaurants for the rest of the meals....or you can go across the road to the Bali Collection for a much wider panel of choices (and much more appropriate prices!)...

5,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali last week using a Luxury Escapes package and we loved it.  We bought 2 packages as we have teenage children and it was a better deal than the ""family package"" option for us.  At no time were we made to feel lesser for being there on the package and using the included vouchers for meals and drinks.  Everything was seamless, from the airport transfer to check in and check out.  We enjoyed all our meals and drinks. The staff were all very friendly and welcoming - especially when we used our limited Indonesian with them. A little ""terima kasih"" goes a long way and when they learned our daughter was learning Indonesian at school they were happy to help her practice.  The gardens are unbelievable - a tropical paradise - and very well maintained. The…"
1,"We had booked this hotel for 3 days but after spending only 1-2 hours we decided to leave the hotel. We thought may be leaving the hotel will not be a wise choice so we asked for an upgradation. The upgraded room was also not up to the mark. Finally Next morning we checked out. Problems faced - room we got was unhygienic. The water was overflowing in the pot. Ac was making some irritating noise and was not even cooling well. Bed sheets was not clean. Alarm clock was not working. Towels were not fresh. Insects in the washroom. Breakfast was boring, lack of hospitality.  We went there because of the brand. Since The hotel has 750 rooms so every time its not easy to locate your room. Moreover the property is so huge that every time we used to get lost in search of our room and get…"
4,"If you are ok to run the risk of Bali belly i would suggest the Grand Hyatt is one of the better places to stay. The rooms are large and easily accomodated a family of 4 (kids under 12), the grounds are lovely and the pool areas are well designed. The draw backs are the pool needs some running repairs both our children incurred injuries from broken tiles (cuts to side of legs) and many of the umbrellas around the pool were broken or not able to withstand the afternoon wind (often they fell over in the late afternoon)..  We were there with another family and while asked for adjoining rooms we were given rooms on opposite sides of a building block so not idea. Food was fine, the breakfast buffet was very light on for fruit (both range and quanity with many mornings they would run…"
4,"We stayed 8 nights in November on a luxury escapes deal and after a busy week in Singapore, this was just what we needed, a place to do as little as we liked.    The hotel has so many food options that at the end of our stay we realised we hadn't tried them all. The breakfast had a huge variety and the pastries were delicious,  however the hot food options could be improved a little.  We mostly had breakfast at salsa verde which was closer to our room, but given it is open air we found ourselves sweaty by the end of breakfast.  We changed to the lovely air conditioned garden café in the last few days.  Our favourite meal was the buffet at Pasar Senggal with the cultural show, loads of options and the kids loved the show too.  Room:  The rooms are quite large compared to most…"
4,"The accommodation area did appear a bit dated. The Balinese spa experience was heavenly, the food options were great too. The beach was beautiful and the waiter service on the beach was very good. The living quarters in my opinion does need refreshing and refurbishing."

Hyatt is a big name in the hospitality sector and has to live upto the expectations as major brands are coming up in the Nusa Dua area"
5,This is our third stay at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. It is a wonderful resort and destination in its own right. The staff are very accommodating and friendly. They cannot do enough for you. The facilities are second to none. I highly recommend a stay at The Grand Hyatt. I normally stay for 8-9 days and I do not find that I have to leave the resort during this time as everything you need is here. Should you need a bit of a mixture a casual walk along the path that follows the shoreline brings you to many other resorts or restaurants. The Bali Collection shopping centre is only a 5 minute walk from the resort with its many and varied eateries and shops that cater for all your needs.. 
2,Grand Hyatt Bali Check in and check out were nightmares  Ppl at the front office were just nowhere. I don’t blame them. Why bother to get anything right when minimum wage probably equals one night in a standard room. Confirmed and reconfirmed airport pick up. No one turned up at airport. Waited 40minutes before someone turned up half asleep n drove us to hotel. Requested non smoking room 2 months before. And January in Bali is off peak season with about 50pct occupancy as I was told by staff and I got a smoking room that smelt foul. Waited another 30mins while they messed me around telling me they had no other room. Eventually they miraculously came up with a non smoking room for me. Breakfast buffet was limited in choices. Service overall was ok. Good pools and gardens. Fun…
5,"This was our first time in Nusa Dua and I thoroughly enjoyed it. We paired this stay with a few days in Seminyak afterwards which was a great balance. The Grand Hyatt is huge but didn't feel overly busy during our stay.   Our room was a Club Executive Suite which was a great size and very comfortably appointed. The Club itself was stunning, overlooking a large pond and the lush grounds of the resort. Staff at the Club were incredibly friendly and the food and beverage options available were good.   We dined one night at Nanpu, the hotel's Japanese restaurant, and I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and would highly recommend a visit here.  Overall I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
4,"we booked a Luxury Escapes holiday at the Grand Hyatt, excellent value again from Luxury escapes. This was the first time we had been to Nusa Dua as previous holidays were in other parts of the Island. Excellent resort for a relaxing holiday and right next door to the Bali Collection. We did not find some of the petty things others complained about, Staff are much older there than any Resorts we have been to in the past. Any request for room maintenance was attended to prompt. Food was excellent  and staff in restaurants friendly though we did find there was no great contingency plan when it rained. We were there one night when it was wet and Garden Restaurant was reasonably full. Staff was limited and could not cope. The front check in deck we found useless. We  read precious…"

The terrain is vast and large, so one could have nice strolls during the evening. Reasonable restaurants and the pools are very fine. We preferred the pool for the club, more quite."
5,We loved the ambience of the hotel. The gardens are very beautiful with the lotus ponds and frangipane. The service was very friendly and food was great. The rooms were very well designed and luxurious. 
4,The location of the Hotel is excellent- right in the beach. The hotel is built in a resort style with cluster of rooms and each overlooking a great view - with lots of ponds with lilles. A large property wilt lots of F&B outlets though we were happy with Grand Club Lounge with its own pool too. The greatest asset of the hotel is its Staff - very hospitable and caring. 
5,"The Grand Bali Hyatt is a terrific hotel: it has amazing garden (hotel is 70 acres), wonderful service catering to your every need, a beautiful beachfront, great food and services and spacious rooms. There won’t be anything that you’ll ‘miss’ in this place - it has everything from shops to SPA, water sports etc. The prices of food and drinks are somewhat steep compared to the average in Bali, but the quality is great. We had to switch rooms because the air conditioning was not working properly, but the friendly staff immediately assigned us with a different room and made the transition very smooth. Definitely a recommendation when staying in Nusa Dua!"
5,"Stunning hotel buildings, beautifully dressed staff with faultless manners & friendliness. The views around the hotel grounds were breathtakingly beautiful. The staff couldn’t have been more helpful. Fantastic stay!! Awesome swimming pools too!!!"

5,"We stayed at this Hyatt Resort to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary.  Staff were EXCEPTIONAL, from the welcome to the Resort to all the servers.  The rooms were large and attention was paid to the smallest detail.  No question was left unanswered.  The food at the restaurants was as good as you would find.Do yourself a favour and stay at this resort.  "
5,Awesome hotel with a great location and excellent courteous staff. The hotel property is very well kept and pristine condition. The beach is clean and beautiful and private. The hotel is in walking distance to Bali Collection which has ample choices to eat and shop. A restaurant that is a must visit is the Bebek Bengul which is close to the waterblow. 
4,"This is my first time in Bali, I choose grand hyatt because i love hyatt brand. First impression was the lotus pond at the lobby, it was pretty nice. The room that i have booked was a standard room, but in my opinion it was too much space!!! One thing that i really disappointed are the amenities in the bathroom was not June Jacob at all!!! It was something like i didnt know how to explained, but i thing it is not up to hyatt standard. I have benn to grand hyatt erawan in bangkok, grand hyatt kuala lumpur in malaysia, grand hyatt singapore. Everywhere i have been through is always June Jacob!!!! Bell man staff so nice, really friendly. "
3,"Like all Grand Hyatt Hotel Resorts, The Grand Hyatt Bali is almost overwhelming in its expansive beauty, lovely common areas, fine art, cuisine, and attention to detail by perhaps 3 of 4 staff.   The problem is that the management is not trained to understand the world of Hyatt's approach to customer service. To keep this short, we had to speak to 4 assistant and acting managers, wasting several hours, to get our breakfasts included with our room as promised. They were never included.  We would have gladly dropped the subject, but the managers hung onto us and wasted our time. We canceled a return of two more days.  The problem here is that at this particular Hyatt Managers will not make decisions and bear the consequences. They need to rotate through some of the 15-20 other…"
5,"Stayed for 8 nights (Luxury Escape deal) in the Grand Hyatt. Picked up at the airport, iced drinks and cold cloths on arrival. Swift check in and ushered to our large hotel room. Fluffy white towels and a rain forest shower later we headed off for dinner at one of the fab restaurants. Staff are falling over themselves to help you, especially if you make the effort to speak a little Indonesian. Breakfasts are amazing, but go early (7-8) or late (10-10.30). The pools are clean and well maintained and plenty of beds to go around. Nampu is by far the nicest food in the resort and nightly cocktails at the Salsa Bar is a must. The grounds are exceptionally maintained by a dedicated staff. The fitness centre is the largest I’ve ever seen in a resort and with the Bali Collection across…"
5,"We stayed at this Hyatt Resort to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary.  Staff were EXCEPTIONAL, from the welcome to the Resort to all the servers.  The rooms were large and attention was paid to the smallest detail.  No question was left unanswered.  The food at the restaurants was as good as you would find.Do yourself a favour and stay at this resort.  "
5,Awesome hotel with a great location and excellent courteous staff. The hotel property is very well kept and pristine condition. The beach is clean and beautiful and private. The hotel is in walking distance to Bali Collection which has ample choices to eat and shop. A restaurant that is a must visit is the Bebek Bengul which is close to the waterblow. 
4,"This is my first time in Bali, I choose grand hyatt because i love hyatt brand. First impression was the lotus pond at the lobby, it was pretty nice. The room that i have booked was a standard room, but in my opinion it was too much space!!! One thing that i really disappointed are the amenities in the bathroom was not June Jacob at all!!! It was something like i didnt know how to explained, but i thing it is not up to hyatt standard. I have benn to grand hyatt erawan in bangkok, grand hyatt kuala lumpur in malaysia, grand hyatt singapore. Everywhere i have been through is always June Jacob!!!! Bell man staff so nice, really friendly. "
3,"Like all Grand Hyatt Hotel Resorts, The Grand Hyatt Bali is almost overwhelming in its expansive beauty, lovely common areas, fine art, cuisine, and attention to detail by perhaps 3 of 4 staff.

5,"We had a room overlooking the beautiful lagoons. We watched the enormous goldfish and other wildlife for hours. The location is great with a shopping and eating village across the hotel entrance. Very good security. Beach was clean, quiet and a squirrel here and there. Food breakfast excellent, staff very helpful. We stayed 14 days and enjoyed every minute. Room and bathroom roomy, very roomy actually"
5,"Stayed at this hotel for a few nights during our recent holiday to Bali. Again, I relied heavily on traveler reviews on tripadvisor to help me decide. The reviews were generally very positive so decided to stay at this hotel. Plus the Hyatt brand is a big attraction!  All in all, I would call it a good stay (not great).... the main issue for me was that the rooms appeared to be dated and in some serious need of an over-hauling. Had a nice room though overlooking a lotus pond (was hoping for an upgrade since I felt that hotels would have lots of vacant inventory due to the recent Mt. Agung activities, but that was not to be... but that's another story!!).  Other than that, you cannot fault the food, service, or warm smiles all around! My daughter fell ill with a stomach bug the…"
5,Beautifully laid landscape each corner tells and smells the Balinese aura. The lobby is amazing with time well sent till night. The resort being too big one must be direction conscious not to get lost. Food is delicious and can be custom ordered.
5,The resort is quite old but the room is neat and clean and very big. We even have a small corner to enjoy our coffee time while reading. They also have special traditional Baliness show night time which is worthy to watch.
5,"I had a very good time, good services, good beach, good pool. good spa. A special mention for Angela in charge of Veranda Lounge. Very professional, always ready for the needs of the costumers. She is a very important resource for Grand Hyatt."

5,"Grand Hyatt Bali is beautiful! We loved our stay! Service,amenities  and food were fabulous! The gym is great and the morning yoga is not to miss! The spa is pricey but we all felt it was worth it! Also the nail service is very nice. While in Bali, next tine I would choose just to stay on the resort and not venture out. The resorts are the best thing that Bali has to offer."
4,"Like a few others I was very disappointed with check-in process and the room we were first taken to was well below standard. Worst thing is that when booking we selected the grand twin room based upon the photo appearing on Hyatt website - well the room we were first shown was nothing like it, the old daybed was more suitable to an animal companion rather than a child, walls were marked and dirty and the a/c was mouldy. After expressing our extreme disappointment I paid to upgrade to another room, which was actually akin to the one we thought we had booked based on the website photo.  Initial dissatisfaction aside we settled in for 11 nights and from then on things improved a lot as our opinion of the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua was positively swayed by the excellent grounds, nice…"
4,"This hotel is great for all types of get aways.  The hotel is large enough to facilitate family, couples, business and singles alike.  The hotel itself does need room, plumbing and electrical upgrades but its careful attention to the atmosphere and customer service makes up.  The water slide made our daughter happy everyday, the spa treatment was a dream, the variety of food was great.  Special recognition to the following staff members who made our stay truly memorable- Suni at Salsa Verde, Tina and Wulan at the Krista Spa and Yumi, Toya and Arisudana at the Garden Cafe.  Special mention to Mulya who took the time to ask us detailed questions about our stay.  Looking forward to another visit..."
5,We had a very nice extended long weekend for the New Years. We where pleasantly surprised with the many facilities and the great focus on family. Excellent staff and fantastic location made for a great albeit expensive mini-holiday. Well done!
1,"If you would like a nice place to stay in Bali, this isnt it. We travelled around Bali staying at lovely places in the hope we were ending the holiday somewhere lovely and relaxing - it wasnt. The rooms were old, moldy and smelt of mildew and made us all sick. The food and drinks were so overpriced. We moved hotels after three nights and no one asked how our stay was or why we were moving."

1,"There are mixed reviews on Tripadvisor regarding this hotel but after staying I'm siding with the one star reviews. Sure if this was a 3-4 star hotel then it's fine. However, this a Grand Hyatt and costs accordingly.  First the good things: - in house doctor and nurse were brilliant. My 7 year old daughter was sick and the two young medical guys were truly professional. They explained the situation and all possible treatments. My daughters Bali belly was greatly improved by the next day.  The not so good things: - Check-in. Managing and operating a hotel check in is just beyond their skill level. Hopefully, the hotel management will come to understand this.Something isn't right. Long lines, rude attitudes and rooms not ready well beyond check in time are my concerns. An hour…"
5,"Stayed for two nights in October 2017. From reception to each corner of the hotel is very neat and clean as well as the friendliness of staff. The rooms are very comfortable with all necessary toiletries, fruit basket, tea coffee etc. Each wing have their own uniqueness. we are in lake side and it is well managed so that one can spend time in the balcony by watching the flower in the lake. Opposite to the hotel there is shopping mall and one can get every thing. There is a plenty of food option from breakfast to dinner and also COCO supermarket. The hotel have their own car rental which is bit costlier but one walk outside the gate and will get much cheaper option. We have traveled by the outside car option to go to Pura Uluwatu and dinner at Jimbaran. Morning one can walk…"
4,"We stayed at the The Geand Hyatt in Sanur Beach for a week, before moving to Ubud for our 2nd week.   For such a large resort it is surprisingly peaceful. We rarely saw any other guests in the grounds, except by the pool, and there was always easy seating in the dining areas.  The grounds are immaculate and full of flowers, tropical courtyards and ponds. The ubiquitous teak fittings are shining with polish and all in good condition. The pool area is lovely and the dining options fresh and delicious. Taking food back to your room is frowned upon, for example a muffin from the breakfast bar (oops!). However, there is plenty to eat at meal times.  Staff are friendly, courteous and attentive without being intrusive.  Dozens of cheap and good restaurants are within walking distance,…"
3,"Checked in for a 6 night family vacation on 25th of Dec 2017. We had asked for a twin king bed as we are two adults and two kids. The first room was one with a large king and then we were changed to another with the hotel’s version of two twins- this is basically two large single mattress side by side on the same bed. Extremely uncomfortable if you are a family with kids. The day bed in the corner are a life saver!!  The general decor and presentation of the rooms is quite tired and in need for repair / revamp. It is stuck in the early 2000s. Ours had a leaking aircon unit, missing iron and kettle for boiling water. The staff is quite helpful and responsive but the rough edges of the room with this price that is charged for it is definitely underwhelming.   The dining options…"
4,"I stayed 3 nights in a ocean view twin room with extra bed  Room: decent size with two standard bed, and extra bed for kid Bed & pillow: comfortable but soft Cleanness: Very clean room, thx to the house keeper Bath: good water pressure and hot, have shower and bath  Services: helpful staff all around Value: what you get is what you pay for, esp. we stay during Christmas time Breakfast: we only ordered a la carte from menu, good portion  Overall this is a relax stay but the kids, the water slide alone can keep them happy for 2 days in a row. Beach is clean but we didn't swim as there were strong current in red flag condition. As usual, to make you feel grand, the hotel is huge and it takes 5-10 min walk from the lobby to your room.

It is really a place for holidays, for relaxing and having fun. The hotel pick-up service from the airport worked perfectly and it is nice not to have to worry. strongly recommended."
3,"We spent a relaxing holidays in Grand Hyatt Bali. Hotel was half full, certainly due to recent volcano news.  This is a gigantic property, you can get lost between the gardens and ponds. Great location in quiet Nusa Dua and walking distance to Bali Collection for dinning and shopping.  Different types of pools will keep kids busy and happy (inc. slide, themed pool...). The beach is very clean with clear and shallow water.  Flip side is the maintenance of such large property and obviously the rooms (esp. bathroom/shower) and facilities (parts of main pool) needs renovation.  Restaurants are also understaffed maybe due to expected low frequentation this year. You need to queue if you come to breakfast after 9:00 and buffet variety is limited.  Room amenities are minimal and more…"
4,Most of rhe staff working there was extremly nice. The complex is huge you can stroll around all day. There are shops inside the villages that was pretty good. Gym is on the smaller side but nice. The grand pool would need a good clean as the grout is very dirty. Housekeeping is very fast but I did mind that they empty dirty bins without no gloves and then give you clean towels.
1,"This is not a 5 star Hotel but more like a 3 star. If you are looking for luxury, don't go there ... Photos speak for themselves, so have a look at the premium room and tell me what you think. This is a 600 rooms hotel that is 30 years of age with no renovation so it is dated and staff are too busy to look after all the guests. The swimming pool was dirty and no one was cleaning it during the day. On the beach, there is no service whatsoever. Your kids won't probably see the difference and will enjoy the slide, but that's pretty much it. I was so disapointed then I asked to get a better room.  They did give me an upgrade room but I had to pay $ 1,400 AUD, very expensive stay at the end. Not happy."
5,"I had an amazing couple days at the Grand Hyatt Bali and felt the need to share my experience with others.  The arrival in the open-air lobby is breathtaking as you can see down to the resort and ocean below.  This is a Big resort - so be prepared to walk around a lot.  We enjoyed that aspect because although the resort was mostly full we never felt crowded by people in any of the areas.  The hotel is also beautifully landscaped and there is a lot of wildlife - ducks, herons, lizards, and more. Our room was next to the beach with a patio overlooking a koi pond.  We had fresh fruit waiting for us and all kinds of luxury amenities in our room.  .The food is really amazing at the Grand Hyatt Bali - I mean really amazing!  We had Grand Hyatt Club benefits and ate at their Grand Club…"

5,We stayed here as a family with young children and loved most of it. The Club room is worth it as it comes with free breakfast and cocktail hour every day so we basically had two free meals a day. Two of the hotel pools have slides which kept our guys busy. Beach access is also a major plus as well as a pay by hour kids club. The Salsa restaurant was delicious and the pool cafe staff are eager to deliver though you’ll have to go to them first to order.   There are a few things the Hotel could work on: primarily language comprehension issues with staff which are understandable though still surprising at an international resort of this size. Also all of Indonesia has a strange issue processing Mastercards so be prepared to use VISA or cash.   Nusa Dua is for those who want to…
2,"The hotel is good but very poor breakfast and the reception work is a real disaster.... specially Mimi, i think the chief is very unfriendly, as we asked for a room near the breakfast restaurant they want to give us a room with a bad smell and view to the neighbors.....(we must understand that the hotel is fully booked!!!!). I can tell you that it was almost empty because many tourist cancelled their vacation because they hear about the active vulcan. Next time we will chose an other hotel for sure! "
5,"Again in Bali, this time at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. A huge and exquisite resort with faultless service, tempting restaurants and fantastic gardens. We had an elegant suite, everything well-appointed. Can't ask for more."
5,"Amazing hotel. Impressed by the grandness of the resort:  - large grounds (you can spend all your time in just 1 wing) - large, clean white beach front - clear sea. shallow for a distance out  - sea waves surf-able - lakes and ponds with Koi, ducks, piles, egrets  - Grand Club lounge with cocktail hours that serves enough food for dinner - Friendly staff that caters to your needs (our flight was hours after checkout and yet hotel was nice enough to allow family to enjoy facilities before heading to airport) - honest staff - left something valuable behind and staff kept for safe return"
3,Have been visiting the hotel for last 7 years but during this stay felt that rooms and bathrooms were run down and had not been renovated for quite sometime. Breakfast area was very crowded and at times took long if we had to get any item prepared fresh.

3,Big impersonal resort that is overpriced and far from the culture of Bali.  Nice pools (there is a nice slide into one of pools that kids will enjoy) and beach (though you have to rent boogie boards - nothing gratis at Bali Hyatt).  Beautiful setting and grounds.  Rooms just okay.
5,"My family loves Grand Hyatt, Bali. We recently went back for our 2nd vacation at the property. The view from our rooms was spectacular. Loved watching the ducks and the birds from our balconies. Lovely beach. A great choice of restaurants. Bali collection with its array of shops and restaurants is just a stone's throw from the property. The staff is very caring and responsive. We just had a wonderful stay and came back with lovely memories. Would not hesitate recommending the property to anyone."
3,"Let me begin by saying this is a beautiful resort. Overall we had a nice stay but I expected more, which is why I left disappointed.   I would not book the Lagoon room, our first room was right on the lagoon and there are lots of mosquitoes! Our room had a mildew smell to it. After 1 hour we  went and upgraded to the Ocean View Room. This room was great. Nice view of the ocean and no smell! I would say the rooms need to be updated but really not a big deal. With 600+ rooms in the resort I understand how some of them smell moldy. Besides that we slept great and the daybed was perfect to sleep our 7&9 year old.   Pool- there are 3 pools (that we saw). They all connect. There is a small, slow slide that little kids might like. The larger slide was nice but the water was very slow…"
5,It is nice to come back here again. Very peaceful resort hotel with breathtaking gardens.  Highly recommended place for relaxing days from the hectic life.  You can do your morning jogging along the coastline and have a nice breakfast nearby the beach at Salsa Verde.
3,"When spending quite a lot of money for a Hyatt Club-room at a five star hotel over Christmas you expect the service and standard to be outstanding. We are travelling with two kids and had booked a room with a twin bed and late check out. Nothing of this was clear when we arrived. The ceiling was leaking quite a lot in the room we also found out immediately so we were able to change into a room with twin beds after two hours. Unpack and pack again... When I asked for a place with the best Internet-connection where I could record a podcast, which has 60 000 listeners in Sweden, I got the answer that it was best to record it in our room. Thinking of the current situation in Bali due to the active volcano and lack of tourists, I found it hard to believe that the hotel is so fully…"

We just had a wonderful stay and came back with lovely memories. Would not hesitate recommending the property to anyone."
3,"Let me begin by saying this is a beautiful resort. Overall we had a nice stay but I expected more, which is why I left disappointed.   I would not book the Lagoon room, our first room was right on the lagoon and there are lots of mosquitoes! Our room had a mildew smell to it. After 1 hour we  went and upgraded to the Ocean View Room. This room was great. Nice view of the ocean and no smell! I would say the rooms need to be updated but really not a big deal. With 600+ rooms in the resort I understand how some of them smell moldy. Besides that we slept great and the daybed was perfect to sleep our 7&9 year old.   Pool- there are 3 pools (that we saw). They all connect. There is a small, slow slide that little kids might like. The larger slide was nice but the water was very slow…"
5,It is nice to come back here again. Very peaceful resort hotel with breathtaking gardens.  Highly recommended place for relaxing days from the hectic life.  You can do your morning jogging along the coastline and have a nice breakfast nearby the beach at Salsa Verde.
3,"When spending quite a lot of money for a Hyatt Club-room at a five star hotel over Christmas you expect the service and standard to be outstanding. We are travelling with two kids and had booked a room with a twin bed and late check out. Nothing of this was clear when we arrived. The ceiling was leaking quite a lot in the room we also found out immediately so we were able to change into a room with twin beds after two hours. Unpack and pack again... When I asked for a place with the best Internet-connection where I could record a podcast, which has 60 000 listeners in Sweden, I got the answer that it was best to record it in our room. Thinking of the current situation in Bali due to the active volcano and lack of tourists, I found it hard to believe that the hotel is so fully…"
5,Perfect peaceful fun family friendly safe beautiful place highly recommend this resort we made memories last a life time  Price was well  suited excellent restaurants many to choose from  Kids love waterslide and park😁🙏😇
5,"We stayed in the club section of the hotel which is a little like a hotel within a hotel, it costs more but if you want a quiet relaxing stay it is worth it. The rooms have different price ranges, some have a walk in closet others have a row of wardrobes opposite the vanitory unit and wasbasins (ours had two basins) with a bath and shower separated by a glass door. The bed was on a raised level with a sofa, tv, mini bar and tea making facilities on the lower level. The rooms are not modern but the bed was comfortable and the furniture good quality with wood desk, coffee table etc. Our room was alongside the club pool, the club pool is a lagoon style feature not deep I could stand up in it, it is not for serious swimming but you could swim a few strokes. Most people with children…"
4,"This is the second hotel I have stayed in at Nusa Dua and again an absolutely beautiful spot. We purchased a luxury escape deal for this hotel and that is the reason we were staying here. The most impressive part of the hotel is the entrance, amazing view out to the ocean. We stayed in the standard room which was clean and roomy, although things are getting slightly dated but nothing that caused concern. There is nothing really to complain about except the cost of food & drinks at the hotel but Bali collection was a 2 minute walk away and we ate there. The grounds of the hotel were glorious and the beach lovely and clean. Stayed during the 2nd week of Australian school holidays and the place was not busy at all although the threat of an erupting volcano probably had deterred…"
5,"I had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. The beach was perfect! Not crowded with almost white sand. Perfect for relaxing. The food variety at the club lounge was also amazing, but I get to try all of the hotel's different restaurants for breakfast. All of them were amazing! The hotel's location too is good, within walking distance to water blow. The staff's service was amazing too, although sometimes it takes a while for the staff to reach my room. Perhaps it's due to the hotel's size. Also perhaps because of the room size, the room was not clean thoroughly before I checked in. I already complained to the staff and they handled it very quickly."
4,"The hotel is very nicely set out, large gardens and pools throughout. Unfortunately the large waterslide was not working for the first week we stayed, much to the disappointment of our 6 year old daughter. However, once it got working we had another 3 days to enjoy the slide which was very busy. A great fun slide though for all ages! Plenty of loungers by the pools. We ate in the hotel a few times however made our way over the road to Bali Collection most lunchtimes and dinners. The room itself was nicely set out, enjoyed sitting out on the balcony late in the afternoon listening to the Balinese music and watching the fish, lizards and birdlife in the lagoon below. We considered paying the extra to get the grand club package, but glad we didn't that part of the hotel seemed…"

5,"A top quality hotel set amidst beautiful grounds with many excellent water features. Lovely, well kept beach and sparkling sea. Customer service is second to none - all staff are so helpful and obliging."
4,"Old fashioned 5 star hotels....it's been a long time since our last visted in Nusa Dua. the hotels looks the same as we visited before...it's about time for the renovation..  a hotel with huge area in decent Nusa Dua , Service are good as usual ,good buffet breakfast"
5,"My daughter and I have just spent the last 9 days at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua and thoroughly enjoyed all this beautiful resort has to offer. From the large well appointed rooms to the gorgeous tropical gardens, huge white sand beach, sparkling clear ocean waters, lovely pools and fabulous restaurants we have relaxed and imbued all this beauty around us. Agung was a marvellous help in managing our reservation and taking care of our special requests. The lady at the fruit counter at breakfast was so kind to ensure we always had our favourite fresh mango for breakfast and all the staff were  unfailing cheerful, polite and extremely helpful at all times. Thank you Grand Hyatt for our perfect holiday!!!!!!"
5,"We used a luxury escapes package & stayed 8 nights in a garden view room. It was the start of our honeymoon. We thought the staff were friendly, grounds stunning, room clean & spacious and the buffet breakfast was really good. We enjoyed all the inclusions that came with our package and the ambience & vista in the Salsa Verde Bar was great for evening drinks! Our only issue was that all prices at The Hyatt's bars & restaurants were very expensive (as we found with most hotels, bars & restaurants in the resort mecca of Nusa Dua) so we mostly visited other areas in Bali where drinks & food were cheaper, spent money & then returned to the luxury of The Hyatt in the late afternoon/evening. "
1,"The door was left open on Monday morning after the cleaning session, called the operator at 11 am to report on this and they said they will check on this. until the day I checked out which was 3 days after I reported on this, I was not informed who is responsible, no explanation, no news basically.  Room is old, giving out the musty smell."

4,"We are just finishing an 8 night stay for 10 family to celebrate 40th & 70th birthdays. It would be the best value holiday we have ever experienced.  The Hyatt is no longer a 5 star but a good 4 star with excellent facilities, good quality food particularly the breakfast, and friendly helpful staff. It covers a vast area and the grounds are manicured. Most resorts can be judged on about 4 main criteria inc bedding and the sleep quality is excellent. Very good spa treatments as well. We feel sorry for Bali being effected by the volcano, but for us it meant a near empty resort with great service and no crowds."
5,"Absolutely fantastic above and beyond all our expectations, amazing staff, nothing was too much trouble all staff members friendly, kind.Amazing pools,just perfect we will be back. Our daughters wedding was magical abd beautiful and the lovely Sherly and Clara made sure the day was relaxed abd everything ran to plan, i have never seen a more beautiful wedding and a more happier wedding couple. Thankyou all do very much."
3,"Thankfully stayed for only one night, but basing this review also on a week of dining and hanging out at the hotel during a conference. Took 45 minutes to check in, despite no queues. Room service food appalling and expensive, service generally clueless, inflexible and unprofessional. Rooms tired and a bit damp, toiletries refilled old bottles. The Japanese restaurant is fab, but all other F&B pretty poor and overpriced (I tried all of them several times). I could go on with silly examples, but won’t bother. All of my colleagues staying used the term “underwhelming”.  It IS a gorgeous property, but that is all. Such a shame and a waste of one of Nusa Dua’s prettiest gounds."
5,"We stayed when Mt Agung erupted, and all flight were cancelled because of volcanic ash. During our stay, all hotel staff took care of us nicely and provided sufficient information about traffic/airline/airport to make us feel comfortable as much as possible."
1,"Checked in for a conference Nov end. Impressed by the hotel surrounding. Checking  in was swift and room was nice. Signboard to room was scared thus was ""lost"" several times. Beside the volcanic scared, and raining daily, walking on the pathway of the hotels was a safety nightmare as tiles/floor was extremely slippery. A guest felled down and wheelchair was seen brought to assist. Room was drenched wet on of the night and was attended in 10 minutes after calling. Since already after 2130 in the night, didn't take the offer for a change of room but was informed tomorrow the Manager will be in touch, but never happened. Decided to have dinner in one of the restorants. Services was appaling. Ordered local dish (soup base) and being served with out spoon. Waited for 10 minutes…"

4,Such a beautiful and clean hotel with spacious clean rooms. Staff were good although sometimes got confused which is understandable. The food pricing was insanely high considering what you get and we found ourselves walking to the Bali collection for meals instead. 2 big spacious pools although the one with the rocks is a bit of a hazard as you need to look underwater as you might step on something. I scraped my legs a couple of times on them. It was a lovely hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be coming back.
1,"Bed is moist and staff weren't very helpful in ensuring the quality of the room. Caught a cold and fell ill after the first night. Requested multiple times to change for a better room, a proper bed without the moist but to no avail."
5,Grand Hyatt is a very huge hotel. A nice venue for convention and holidaying. Nice and comfortable rooms and there are choices of restaurant for hopping around. Good food and nice and friendly service. Staffs are courteous and cheerful. Nice walking/jogging paths and beautiful beach and sea.
5,"Arrived at this hotel and was overwhelmed at the reception from its staff and the beautiful views from the exquisite lobby. The layout of the hotel is fabulous! Surrounded by manicured gardens and water features. Our bedroom was large, with a huge bed and a bathroom with shower and bath, superb air conditioning and a nice view of the gardens. The hotel has a few restaurants, all very nice, though a little more expensive than the nearby Bali collection which hosts shops and many restaurants. The breakfast at the Salsa verde is wonderful, so much choice of beautiful fresh food: fruits, meats, pastries, cooked breakfast of all tastes, with fresh juices and as much tea and coffee as you wish. A very special mention for the staff here, greeted each morning with amazing smiles and a…"
2,"after dinner my husband and I  wanted to have a drink, so before going back to the room we sat down at veranda lounge. I ordered a mojito and he ordered a beer. the beer arrived after few minutes but 15 mins later my mojito has not arrived so I asked one of the waiter. she came back after 5 mins and told us that they have finished the ingredients to make mojito. If they came to me earlier i could have changed the order but it was already 21.45 and the nanny who is baby sitting our children should leave by 22.00, i wouldn’t want to risk to wait another 15 mins to find out that my drink isn’t available 😓.

3,"The sprawling grounds and distance between the various pools, beach, restaurants and accommodation wings (particularly in very hot or wet weather) makes for lengthy walks at times.  Beware, not all room locations are equal.  Some accommodation wings are at the back of the resort with ordinary views and limited breezes.  Other wings close to the beach/main pool are good.  The restaurants are lovely and the Salsa Bar has wonderful views and ambience.  We wouldn’t return due to the sheer size of the property."
5,"Just the most stunning property imaginable, with fantastic restaurants and leisure areas. Staff are amazing and always friendly. We payed for the Club upgrade which is so worth it for the breakfast, all day refreshments and amazing canapes and drinks in the evening."
5,"The Grand Hyatt is one of the best, the service was fantastic, the room was clean, the only downside was we had 2 single beds instead of a queen, which was what we usually get at hotels with VIP up grade, BUT we got a room overlooking the emerald pools which were nice, we were situated within easy access to all the restaurants so we were happy and for 8 nights being in a single bed was not a hardship!"
1,"We just left the Hyatt and are very unsatisfied with the Bell Boy Staff, we had a late flight and when asked if we could get a late checkout were given a 1pm checkout and told we could use fitness studio before we would head to airport (that promise wasn’t fulfilled) and were told another guest was going to take our room but hotel was pretty empty with lots of rooms but OK. The reason we are so unhappy is that when we returned from dinner and wanted to pick up our bags the Bell Boy told us he would meet us downstairs at the fitness studio to deliver our bags “ HE NEVER SHOWED UP!!” so we went downstairs to the studio but did not get clear instruction how to get there and the path was super dark and it was heavily raining, when we got to fitness studio it had just closed at 10pm…"
4,We purchased our package through luxury escapes and thought the package was amazing value for money. We are a family of 2 adults and 2 children. Our room faced the Balinese pool. View was beautiful and room size was fine. The grounds are unbelievable...surreal almost. The Kriya spa is a must. We ate at the hotel often and never had a bad meal. Hotel is very close to Bali Collection and easy access to wonder through the other hotels close by along the beach. Pools are beautiful and my husband/son loved the water slide. The only negative critiques I could mention is that the rooms (although they more then do the job) could do with a bit of a face lift and that I didn’t feel there was a lot on for children compared to other hotels. Worth mentioning is the amount of free bottled…

5,"Grand Hyatt is truly a Grand property, situated in the heart of the 5 star resorts area. The property is a perfect blend of modern and nature mix to it. The vibe of the place is very positive and the staff is very friendly. Smiling all the time which is a big positive for there customer service. Special thanks to Hana Marwati who took extra care of the guests with all her time and made us very comfortable as it was our first time visiting Bali. Cheers to the management team at Grand Hyatt Bali !! :)"
5,"The Grand Hyatt in Bali continues to provide exceptionally high standards at every level from the initial arrival/check in to a very friendly departure and all aspects of what a top 5 star resort hotel should be- in some 25 years of stays we have never been disappointed. There are a great many very good top hotels in Bali but the Grand Hyatt still outshines all of them in attitude, ambience and facilities."
5,"This was my 7th trip to the Grand Hyatt. It is a delight of Balinese style and  gardens. The staff is kind, engaging, welcoming and ready to make your visit perfect. The spa facility is among my favorites from around the world. The Nusa Dua peninsula has beautiful landscaping and gardens  and I appreciate the extra layer of security as a solo female traveler on some of my visits. The Grand Hyatt is a place to relax, unwind, enjoy the gracious, smiling hospitality of Bali. "
5,"We were a group from India and were staying in the West village. The property is simply awesome.... Though we had a short stay of 2 nights, it was excellent.  The swimming pool in form of lagoon is very beautiful... The landscaping is such that some times you forget being in man-made pool. It gives an impression of natural lagoon with caves and rocks.  I was with my son 4 who loved the kids pool. Lavish breakfast spread spoils you for choices.  One suggestion as the property is massive  a golf cart or electric vehicle even on chargeable basis would be appreciated to commute and explore the entire property.  The rooms were snug. Bathroom especially toilet little bit tight on space but not worth complaint.  Surely it is Grand!!!"

4,"Had an extended break of three weeks and so glad we paid a little more for a club room Breakfast and complimentary canapés were plenty and varied. Club pool and near the beach was very relaxing,. As always in Bali it is the people who make your stay fantastic, nothing is too much trouble. The manager at the club was very professional and all the staff were superb. We are Hyatt members but I don’t think we were given special treatment  One small criticism, perhaps is that pool bar service is not proactive, they tend to hide behind the bar and chat or text on their phones, so 9 out of 10"
5,"We arrived late at night and there was a problem with our room's booking. our room was occupied by different people, the receptionist accepted her mistake very fast and replaced our room with a better room. amazing experience! thank you"
4,"We are a family of four with young teenage daughters and we decided to celebrate my 50th in style by staying at the Grand Hyatt (our first time to Bali); a deal we found on Luxury Escapes. The hotel is magnificent with beautiful, well maintained grounds, gardens and ponds. Check-in was a bit slow, I presumed they just wanted us to have a seat with the refreshing cold towel and drink until we had composed ourselves! Even though the hotel was at 33% capacity (one of the concierges told us this was because they had a lot of cancellations due to the Mt Agung rumbling) we were not able to get an upgrade. :( In the package we had two inter-connecting rooms which was great. The rooms however looked tired and in need of a cosmetic upgrade (marks on the walls, ceiling, when the aircon…"
4,"Everything about the place was excellent, except the price of extras, like food. (Complimentary bottle was was provided each day though) The breakfast was $88 AUD for 2 people. So this was the first and last time we ate there."

5,"Good resort with very nice view to the beach , great service in the restaurant . Well maintained property. The swimming pool and bar area can be maintained more well with better cleanliness. Food is priced very expensive "
5,He stayed in Grand HYatt for 6nights. Lovely room facing amazing ocean view. Room was clean n tidy. Housekeeping staff is very accommodative. Good to see Chef Creg an amazing personality with the magic in hands. Special thanks to Angani and Devi for such a wonderful spa experience. Highly recommended to the traveler for luxurious stay in Bali 
3,"I’m a frequent traveler and would stay in Grand Hyatt around the world for my preferred business travel hotel.  Stayed at grand hyatt Bali for a short vacation. Lobby is nice and grand. Rooms are big and clean. However  the furniture looks old - from the 80’s and the marble floor can use some polishing.  Ordered breakfast, intercontinental breakfast. The fruit were nice and fresh. Others were disappointing.  I decided not to dine in the hotel.   In terms of service, the staff were all  warm and friendly.  I’m not sure why hyatt can still claim that this hotel is a grand hyatt and 5 star hotel. It’s should be reviewed. "
5,This place was awesome for the whole family. More expensive than your regular Bali stay but worth every dollar. Highly recommended for familys. We had a 3 and 5 y.o and we had an amazing time. The gardens and the pools were above and beyond and the wildlife was great
3,"First look of the property was good but all hopes turned down on seeing the rooms! Air conditioning was pathetic. After repairing it a couple of times, I was told that its the best they can provide. Aesthetics in the room seemed too old & not expected from a hotel of this class. Furniture wasn't good too. Bathrooms were too small. Some of the staff members were courteous while others behaved in a way that they are doing some favor by letting us stay in the hotel. Absolutely not expected from a Grand Hyatt property. All in all, go to this property if you don't want to stay in rooms at all. Property is GRAND but doesn't give you a HYATT experience. "

5,"The Grand Hyatt is truly an amazing place. The staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome from the minute you step out of your car. Be sure to join World of Hyatt or upgrade your stay to have Club privileges as the food in the Club (breakfast and evening) is excellent. Everyday the menu is different. The grounds are absolutely amazing, you just can't stop taking pictures!"
5,"I had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali. The Resort is so beautiful - everything is in such a good condition... I loved to walk just through the resort, to enjoy the view of everything. I got to know a lot of employees during my stay which were so kind and checked if everything was fine. Especially I would like to mention Made Rata (F&B) and Christine (GRL). I really enjoyed, that everybody was so friendly and greeted when passing by! You make your guest really feel welcome. I will come back! Next time with my family! "
5,"This hotel is simply one of the most beautiful ones I have every stayed at. The lush landscaping that has matured over time is a breath to behold. It is a very large hotel, more akin to a college campus, but don't let that scare you away. It is even more attractive due to the vast area of ever more beauty as you walk around the grounds. It is Hawaii on steroids.  I am a Globalist, so my review may be somewhat skewed due to the high level of attention I received and the services offered. I stayed in an area offered to Hyatt Globalists, near the Club Lounge. We had our own private pool, and were close to the beach. I used a Hyatt upgrade certificate that I earned and was given a beautiful suite with an ocean view. Again, remember, this is November, low season and all, so I…"
5,The perfect resort for a carefree holiday at a beautiful beach. Paradise gardens and fantastic architecture. Pricey but wonderful fine dining restaurants. My room was spacious and comfortable. The resort is huge and conveniently located next to a nice mall. Would love to stay here again.
5,"Visited the Bali Grand Hyatt last years; this was an excellent revisit with several days in a very comfortable suite. Daily breakfast and very nice evening appetizers available   the club lounge. It was interesting to watch the fish, lizards and flowers of the pond, this is a beautiful location. Club staff extremely kind and helpful. The pools are absolutely beautiful; there are two water slides with a large rambling main pool. The club has a two tier pool with a small waterfall and was more quiet and restful not so deep pool. The beach is great, cleaned daily to remove the seaweed that washes ashore. Only a short walk to the Bali Collection shopping centre, across the street."

We were made very welcome  and allocated the room we requested which was much appreciated and the service we received was professional and friendly from all. It was lovely to see Mr Adi again and he and his coleague Putra made sure our room was kept clean, comfortable and well stocked, overseen with consideration by Mr Rikki  The grounds and beach are kept beautiful and clean by the hard working staff , especially in the heat  Prompt and considerate attention in The Watercourt and Garden Cafe, thanks to Rai Sari, Sudi, Mundri, Sandi and Suwar in particular.  We also loved the Bay Club  Overall we would highly recommend this resort -…"
1,"Very unpleasant stay. The hotel looks run down, the service is very very slow. It is far below the expection!  Always had to call the guest relations more than once to get the things we needed. It happened again this evening. Very poor service!! Breakfast selection is also very poor, way below the expection as a five star hotel breakfast buffet."
5,"Stayed for 8 nights thru Luxury Escapes and it was fantastic,wonderful surrounds and beach,excellent staff and meals,a little pricey but with the Bali Collection next door it was a shopping dream,a dream of a holiday "

1,Booked this hotel for family holiday. Checked out after 2 hours. Hotel is 27 years old. Everything feels dated. Photos displayed on hotels.com are deceiving. We booked a renovated room; it was still a 27 year old room with dated bed & worn furniture. The nail in the coffin for us were the smokers.There was cigarette ash on the balcony floor and people smoking everywhere. Staff were slow and couldnt really care less. The hotel is not up to western 5 star standards and certainly not like any Hyatt we've stayed at before. Dont waste your money. The Westin and Ritz Carlton next door are much better and true 5 star hotels.
5,Stayed there with friends during our exploring trip to Bali. Hotel is surprisingly grand by the beach. Room kept well-maintained and we had one with a balcony overlooking to beautiful pond. Staff was prompt to assist with our requests. The lady staff was genuinely generous to walk us to our rooms although they were distant from the main lobby building. The beach of the hotel was simply beautiful and calm. We were overall very impressed with their service. The highlight was that they recognized our friend’s birthday and we had a surprised birthday cake to celebrate upon our return from excursion!
5,"Very friendly staff who were eager to help you in anyway they can. Huge land with several ponds each one with lovely lotus flowers. Many swimming pools including toddler's pool!  Variety of restaurants -  Japanese, Italian,  Indonesian, Asian"
5,"Highlights - white beautiful sand with blue water and clear skies! Let me tell you, I have never seen any prettier full moon than the one I saw in Bali. Dinner in the beach was perfect for that alone!  The entire hotel has a pretty landscape filled with a lot of flowers around and there was always a traditional music performance at the entrance of the hotel - that plus the breathtaking view in a windy day, perfect!  Staffs were very friendly and helpful - guided me how to send out postcard and assisted with my request for a plug converter.  There are a few shops within the hotel itself so worry not about getting souvenir for your loved ones too!  The only comment from my 3D2N stay was that: AC in my room was not working. But because my stay was pretty short and I barely in the…"

4,"I spent a third of my stay in Bali at the Grand Hyatt. It's in Nusa Dua, which feels worlds apart from Seminyak or Ubud. It feels like a mega resort in Hawaii, so be prepared for a lot of kids. Other than the main pools, there are two other smaller pools, including a Balinese Feature Pool, that are much quieter. The location is a bit isolated in the sense that you can't walk to the local ""town"", but taxis are readily available. It's only a few mins to some great restaurants in the area. Jimbaran and Kuta were both fairly close.   Everyone I encountered was genuinely nice. I cannot stress how friendly everyone was in Bali.   The standard room was quite spacious, and has a huge day bed/sofa.   I had club access so I had breakfast there. There was a big selection of pastries, cold…"
4,"I am amazed with the beautiful garden and lotus lond, which gave us serene and tranquill ambience.The garden is well manicured and the animals (fish,ducks,birds even some wild birds came to lotus pond and garden during our  visit,small lizard also) are well treated Kids friendly? Yes. More over if your kids love to swim in the beach and love nature Cleanliness : very good,you rarely find rubbish in such big garden Staff : very kind,and caring.They even took great care of my baby son's bath necessities,giving him bath toy.thank you! Condition of the building : old since it was built in 1991. But otherwise i appreciate the peaceful and relaxing ambience,especially in the garden and lotus pond "
5,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we had the most amazing holiday.  We are from the U.K. So travelled a long way and we weren't disappointed. The hotel is stunning. It was quiet as well because of the volcano but that hadn't put us off going and I hope it doesn't for others too.  The staff are wonderful, so helpful.  Would like to thank the laundry for the most amazing service for our washing.  Out rooms were lovely, cleaned daily.  Breakfast was gorgeous with lovely staff especially Roy who was so friendly and helpful.   We had a massage whilst there and a couple of meals at the hotel, salsa verde was our favourite but the buffet was nice too.   Our children went to kids club a couple of times, the best kids club ever. They loved it and the staff are just lovely.…"
3,"The location is stunning and the property is magnificent. The pools, beach and gardens are well maintained and the whole area is delightful. Inside is where things are a let down. The breakfast is very poor indeed. The selection is poor, the coffee and tea seem to have been substituted for dishwater and the orange juice tasted like it was a powdered drink. The croissants were tasteless. Even the fresh fruit was not quite ripe and lacking in taste. This is one of the poorest 5* hotel breakfasts I have experienced. Housekeeping is very hit and miss. Some days they give you new soap and shampoo, other days not; sometimes your towels are replaced, some days not. I wanted to ask for a brush to sweep the sand from the floor because clearly it was too much trouble for them. And then to…"
4,"Recently stayed as part of a luxury escape voucher.  Loved the resort for its luxurious feel and balinese achitecture. The location was ideal opp. Bali Collection for dinner out as a more affordable alternative than eating at the hotel and for quick trips to the supermarket. Only negative is that their water slide was undergoing maintenance hence very dissappointed daughter.  Other negative is that their is nothing else to entertain kids with once the pool is closed and dinner is finished.  Have stayed at other resorts with big games room with pool tables and air hockey, a 2 lane bowling strip on fake grass a few computer games, board games  with a bar where kids and parents can continue to have fun and interact enjoy a coffee and beer"

5,"The Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua Bali was a very unexpected and fabulous surprise. In the past we have seen TV programs showing the untidy happenings in Bali and have always put it on the things not to do list. However, we have just come home from 8 days at The Grand Hyatt and are very happy to say that it was almost everything we did not expect. The Grand Hyatt from its drop off at the front gate and reception to the rooms, resort facilities the many restaurants is exceptional. The staff are always happy to past the time of day with friendly greetings and the whole operation is extremely clean and tidy.  It is located 50 or so metres from ""The Bali Collection"" which for those who require extra shopping and more variety of eating styles is 5 walk minutes away.  We enjoyed the…"

Thanks Grand Hyatt you have restored my faith"
5,"Just returned from my second 8 night stay at this fantastic hotel. Friendly, sincere, courteous and happy staff make it great.  Rooms and hotel grounds are excellent. Can not rate highly enough and will certainly return in the near future.  The jewel in the crown of Nusa Dua hands down."
5,"We have recently returned from an amazing stay at The Grand Hyatt  Bali in Nusa Dua. We literally loved every minute of it. We had a standard room and it was perfectly adequate for our family of 2 adults plus 2 small boys, who slept comfortably on the included day bed. We were lucky enough to get a lagoon view room which was superb. We had daily visits from schools of fish, ducks, other large water birds and 2 large monitor lizards, which made for a terrific pre-dinner G&T spot. The kids were suitably impressed. The bed was comfortable, air conditioning worked well and the bathroom was very nice. I had been worried by other reviews of rooms, but our experience was that they are good quality, clean and certainly of 5 star standard. Of course you get quite a range in the 5 star…"
5,"Just in front of Bali collection and you just can walk there for shopping, lunch or dinner. Swimming pool is also large enough to play whole day with children. The beach in front also can swim when low tide. I think it's suitable for family stay."

5,"I'm profoundly happy to let the rest of the world know that Grand Hyatt Bali is an Incredible Resort!!! The layout of the hotel is awesomely inviting with well kept landscape, that showcased Angel's and God's sculptures in and out of memorizing ponds with cascading waterfalls that rejuvenated your soul.  My room was very comfortable and clean with all amenities. The highlight in my room was the bathroom - you could see the bedroom, patio, tree and sky out of the wooden louvers from the bathtub area. The Spa 'Kriya Spa'experience was like a taste of heaven. The Resort has 8 options of Restaurants and Bars to eat in, such as - Asian to European dishes 'Garden Cafe':Japanese cuisine 'Nampu': Open - Air Balinese Restaurant with nightly live entertainment and a night local 'Art and…"
2,"We were at Grand Hyatt in may and thought this was magic, hence the reason we chose to go back albeit for 3 nights but we wanted to see our friend Eky who would have to be one of the nicest people on this planet.  Fortunately he hadnt changed one bit but the accommodation was a disaster."
5,"Been staying here for over 20 years and it never disappoints! If you are in Bali, you have to stay here and book the Grand Club! The GC staff are the best! They will truly make you feel at home! Make sure you start with Jepun, a sparkling wine from Bali during cocktail hours! :)  "

4,We just returned from our 8 night Luxury Escapes package and had a truly wonderful experience. The staff were very friendly and accommodating and I'd like to thank Mira (?) at reception for managing to put us in a couple of Emerald Pool view rooms which were lovely. We were originally checked in to Lagoon view rooms but you could definitely see the difference as I did read previous reviews that mentioned how tired the rooms were. The Emerald Pool rooms had the same layout but were in much better condition and the pools were a fantastic quiet spot - a great escape from the noisier main pools. The grounds were fabulous and it felt like there was a photo opportunity around every corner. We made full use of all of our vouchers and the Kriya spa was exceptional. Thank you to Sri and…
5,"Our second stay here and was wonderful once again!  I'd highly recommend this hotel to families - everything and everyone is catered for.  The gardens are immaculate, a variety of pools to swim in and restaurants to eat at.  Hope to enjoy more stays at Grand Hyatt Bali!"
5,I spent a week here with my partner and we had the most relaxing visit. Our room was clean and spacious with a view of the sea from our balcony. The room could benefit from a clothesline in the bathroom or a drying rack on the balcony to help with wet bathers and the shower takes 5+mins to get warm but that is nit picking on my part. I also feel that the hotel could do with one more pool - maybe an adults only area. There is a lot of under-utilised lawn area in front of salsa bar that would be perfect for an infinity pool. Cocktails at sunset there would take on a whole new wow factor. But the beach here is the highlight for me - so golden and so wide but be aware it is tidal so don’t be disappointed if all you can see are rocks - that will change. I would also like to see the…
5,"Very Big Hotel then most of things you can enjoy in the hotel.  Pool -> very big, clean.   Beach -> very wide, good. in front of the hotel.  Restaurants -> many choice. Good service  Shopping -> 5minitus walk to Suvenir Moll  Rooms are clean and good customer services."
5,"On our first trip to Bali we wanted a safe an secure location. Nusa Dua certainly ticked all the boxes. Absolute beach front luxury. The staff were so humble and lovely, could not do more to help us. The dining experiences were excellent also. We will be back !!"

5,"We stayed here for 3 nights on our honeymoon. This place is incredible! You could come here and never have to leave the hotel. The resort offers multiple restaurant options, some retail shops, banking service and money exchange, beautiful pools and gardens, spa & beauty services, beach access, kids club.  The staff are very professional and friendly as you would expect from a well renowned resort. It also felt very safe with the high level of security. Facilities are extremely clean and well kept.  While a bit on the expensive side, we managed to get a good deal on lastminute.com as we booked our accommodation as we went which I would highly recommend for anyone travelling to Bali. Much cheaper for last minute bookings and you’ll never be without accomodation. Breakfast was…"
3,"As a fairly new World of Hyatt member, I was thoroughly unimpressed by the service at the Grand Hyatt Bali. First, my assistant specifically called to ensure early check in. However, when we arrived, there was no such notation in the system and the staff at the desk was completely indifferent, almost annoyed. She dismissively barked that the room is clean but needs to have the amenities replenished and could offer no estimated time for this when asked. She actually turned her back at the counter and walked away in the middle of my question. Second, we used cash plus points for $75 USD per night. She told us it would be $140 USD per night. I told her there was an error and to re-check. Again, she was apathetic and gave zero indication of concern about the mis-pricing. She just…"

5,"Upon arrival we were treated like royalty. This is magnificent. The grounds are incredible, the swimming pools are so beautiful and it is right on the beach. Everything about this resort is a dream come true. We are here for our honeymoon. Our room looks over the garden and is very spacious. The bed is very comfortable, as are the pillows. The air conditioning is perfect and can be set to whatever temp you may prefer. We are in the Italian restaurant today and it was marvellous. Prompt service, friendly staff and the meals were amazing. A little more expensive than other dining experiences we have had while in Bali, although worth the extra money and you are guaranteed a fantastic meal. The resort is on the beach which has very white sand. There are plenty of beach activities…"

5,"Had a very pleasant stay at the Hyatt.  This was for our annual Bali Classic golf tournament.  Hotel is in excellent condition, it is peaceful, SPA is excellent, the sunday brunch buffet was also very good.  Will definitely do again."
2,"I stopped here for a couple of nights for a “luxury” break after spending quite a bit of time in the Gili islands. I have been to many Grand Hyatt properties over the years but this one was a sore disappointment. The rooms were battered and old, in extremely poor repair. Paint was chipped and peeling and the porcelain was peeling off the tubs and sinks. My first room stank of, what I think was pest extermination spray, so much that I requested a change to a new room (to be fair they graciously provided this). The new room was in no better repair.   By the pool you have cheap plastic lawn chairs and have to go collect your own towels (and return them). You also have to go to the pool bar to order as there is never a waiter willing to come over to help. They frequently play…"
5,"Outstanding resort and fantastic value thru Luxury Escapes. Easy access to Bali Collection Shopping across road but apart from that no need to leave resort. Staff were excellent as they probably are at most Bali resorts, friendly, personable, always willing to chat and/or offer advice. Beach is great for relaxing maybe not for surfing. Walks along the beach both ways very easy and enjoyable. Resort facilities first class eg. Gym/sauna/spa/pool. Resort grounds are beautifully cared for and all facilities are close to your accom."
4,"Very disappointed bigger water slide not working at all during our 10 day stay, due to maintenance.  No timeline for completion was given nor suggestions of other activities that would be fun for the children or families. Grounds are beautiful, needs to be seen as photos do not do it justice"
4,We arrived to a professional greeting which was pleasing as this was our second time staying at the hotel. This time we booked a Grand Suite Room.  As an Australian we felt it was very expensive but it was a beautiful room offering a lot more space than an average room with a separate lounge area which still has the daybed that my daughter slept in.  At nearly 10 it was already nearly to short so perhaps wouldn't be suitable for her next time. The pools and grounds are beautiful creating a lovely family vibe. We checked out the Kids Club as last time it was closed as being rebuilt.  We were very disappointed to see it was just set up for very young children.  Not appealing to anyone over 6 I'd say. We've seen some fantastic kids clubs overtime and this wasn't one of them. We'd…

4,"Great property and with lots of friendly staff! Many restaurants in the resort, breakfast, lunch, dinner, room service - No worries you're covered!   Amazing sweeping landscapes! The pool meanders into a lagoon type feel, kids love it and has relaxed vibe. Note: go early to get your spot, especially if it's busy season! The beach is gorgeous and clean and I would recommend early as well, it gets pretty hot in Bali! There are some locals selling stuff but pretty harmless, take a look buy of you like or just say no thank-you.  Also, you can rent bikes for a ride along the beach front priorities, however once you reach St. Regis, you must dismount and walk pass this property, no riding allowed and security will let you know, so just play by the rules.  Oh almost forgot, there's a…"
5,Stayed in Dec 2015 This is by far the biggest resort that I ever stayed worldwide they have big and clean room The executive lounge offered a wide range of food and beverage Breakfast was good as well I think the only downside from this hotel is their beach is dirty.. Not garbage dirty but it was seaweed everywhere it does make it less appealing
2,"We had a disappointing 8 night stay at the Grand Hyatt with our family of 5.  Room- First morning our bathroom flooded from a leak in the ceiling. Took all day to fix and would not change us to a different room. This was obviously a continual problem, mouldy ceiling. Pictures attached.  As for the rest of the room soft furnishings are really old and walls could use with a paint. Cleaning was ok but it was hard with how old everything is. Our room aircon was so noisy you could only use a low setting and  in the other room you could not change the temperature.   Kid Activities - The 50m Waterslide was closed when we arrived and was continually lied to about when it was to reopen being told in two days every time we asked which was everyday. Maintenance was carried out on 4 days of…"
5,"12 days of amazing relaxation, delicious food and cocktails by the pool.   Travelling with 4 kids who enjoyed living in the expansive, beautiful and tropically warm pools for the entire vacation. Highly recommended resort for a family holiday.  The beach was great for finding shells and coral, and Bali Collection across the road provided economical massages and cheaper food."
3,"Three key things really spoilt our family holiday.  Firstly, for a non-smoking resort they seem to be quite lax with the rules.  In fact, the only rule that they seem to abide by is that you can only smoke if it inconveniences other people.   Whether it is by the pool, at the breakfast buffet, in the lobby or on adjacent room balconies, there always seems to be a waft of cigarette smoke.  As the staff and management are reluctant to do anything about it, I have been forced to ask people to either move or stop smoking around my children.  Secondly, the hotel waterslide was out of action for the duration of our eight-day stay.  This was extremely disappointing as it was the main reason that we chose this hotel.  Many other families with young children were equally disappointed for…"

5,We stayed in this huge property for 3 nights. It is beautifully made and the staff is very courteous. It has a huge atrium and the staff is very welcoming. The rooms are elegantly done! The Kriya Spa is a must-go place during the visit. Prior reservation is recommended. Definitely recommended.
4,"Been this hotel for family vacation. Firts of all this hotel resort is huge. It consists of several guest rooms building, and you might easily get lost. (Actualy I did 2-3 times) Naturally it is hard to distinguish which building or which room is relatively better place. In my case I was assigned certain room but romm cleaning was ready for my check-in so the staff at the front desk had diificulty to find vacancy for me. (Staff was professional however it took 15-20 min. to locate me ancother vacancy)  So general process in this hotel is quite not bad, since they knwo what they have to do. Meanwhile they can not treat you with relatively personalized ways. So you have to request or ask your matter with more frequency.   Food is not that bad. Some people complaining about food…"
5,"Recently had an 8 day stay at the Grand Hyatt utilising a fabulous offer from Luxury Escapes. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, all staff were absolutely amazing. We were made to feel extremely welcome. Our room was comfortable clean andpeaceful with lovely views out over the garden. It was really well replenished every day. The pool area is huge and getting a sun lounge each day was never a hassle. The dense shady trees are a real bonus. Restaurants are all very nice but our favourite was the Salsa bar, best place to wind down after a hectic day spent poolside. Would recommend"
5,"A fabulous hotel set in beautiful grounds with tropical gardens, statues and water fountains and pools - together with an amazing beach location. All staff are lovely, friendly and cheerful - extremely helpful, great customer service. We tried most of the restaurants on site and meals were consistently great. A fantastic place to relax and enjoy wonderful surroundings - highly recommended. My wife unfortunately needed a doctor during our visit but the speedy attention and service provided by the hotel could not have been better and she was prescribed treatment which helped her get well quickly so that our holiday was not spoilt. We were in the West Wing which meant we got to know the place well during our daily walks to the beach and (in our opinion), we were nearest to the best…"
4,"Truly beautiful resort with gorgeous gardens and grounds.    Our room was large enough for four, I traveled with a friend, my 6 year old son and her 10 year daughter.  The day bed was large enough for two smaller kids but not a 6 and 10 year old - especially ones that don't know each other that well!  The king size bed is more like a super king (think two doubles/queens pushed together) so it comfortably slept the adults with the small 6 year old in the middle and pillows in between.   We felt so spoilt with the luxury escapes meal and spa vouchers.  There was never a problem with booking anything.  Breakfast at Salsa Verde was lovely - it overlooked the pool and there were heaps of squirrels to watch.  It seemed busier than the breakfast at Garden Cafe but the Garden Cafe had…"

1,"I been many Hyatt hotels and this is something worst ....no service,  no class of breakfast even have to wait 20 mins, no cleanses... nothing is great over here .. spoil my vacations, rest see in photos "

4,"We booked our holiday with Luxuryescape.com (8 nights, 3 dinners, airport transport, etc). Airport pickup was very smooth and efficient. Checkin was also very smooth and room was already prepared and in excellent ground floor/pond view in West wing location.  We had some hit and misses (mostly missed) with meals. I will provide detailed review separately but below is summary: 1) Breakfast at Salsa Verde - Very good location overlooking pool, wait staff are constantly struggling to keep with with volume of customers. Food quality and below average. Have to wait longtime for egg, omelette and pancakes/waffles. 2) Breakfast at Garden Cafe - Very good location overlooking pond, wait staff are very relaxed and friendly. Food quality and above average. egg station and waffles are…"
4,Attended a wedding end of September in this property and the property premises is just beautiful. The common areas and the view is just amazing  However the rooms compared to the common area is just poles apart the rooms are fairly dated and need quite some attention by the hotel. The room service is very slow every time we ordered food it took more than one hour every time and was cold and unappetising which was a huge disappointment.  However the food in the restaurants in the hotel is very good.  All in all a decent hotel and a must stay if the rooms are upgraded.
4,It’s a pity to come to Bali and to stay here. Of course no surprise but this hotel has no charm and there are so many lovely place or boutique hotel on this island  This hotel is too big (1000 rooms) in a luxury touristic ghetto  Of course it looks safe but don’t be afraid to look for an other place. Bali is a paradise so look for a real place   Bali deserve a real visit

Food quality and above average. egg station and waffles are…"
4,Attended a wedding end of September in this property and the property premises is just beautiful. The common areas and the view is just amazing  However the rooms compared to the common area is just poles apart the rooms are fairly dated and need quite some attention by the hotel. The room service is very slow every time we ordered food it took more than one hour every time and was cold and unappetising which was a huge disappointment.  However the food in the restaurants in the hotel is very good.  All in all a decent hotel and a must stay if the rooms are upgraded.
4,It’s a pity to come to Bali and to stay here. Of course no surprise but this hotel has no charm and there are so many lovely place or boutique hotel on this island  This hotel is too big (1000 rooms) in a luxury touristic ghetto  Of course it looks safe but don’t be afraid to look for an other place. Bali is a paradise so look for a real place   Bali deserve a real visit 
5,"Excellent property  ..beautiful sea facing rooms , made our stay quite wonderful and grand. Excellent room service  even at odd hours in the night was a bonus for our entire group.  What i most liked was the sumptuous breakfast spread starting from exotic fruits to an array of different breads they had it all."
3,"My husband and I visited Bali for a destination wedding with service par excellence but we faced 2 major drawbacks which are the basics of any hotel industry.  Poor airconditioning with temperature set at 23 degree Celsius for all the rooms and no fans.mind u it gets very humid during daytime. Terrible housekeeping with used cups not replaced or washed,no mopping of the floor and the tables dirty. Else resort is pretty."
2,I've travelled the world in my wheelchair and tend to pick the big hotel names to assure accessibility. Unfortunately the Grand Hyatt failed to deliver. The 'accessible' room poor bathroom access with a very narrow doorway to get to the toilet. The management staff were friendly enough and suggested that I use their in-house wheelchair which I pointed out was far wider than my own. They did upgrade my room out of necessity. Only the suite room had a toilet I could get near. I realise Bali is a developing nation and hence accessibility doesn't feature prominently but the Grand Hyatt is not a 'developing' brand and should do better.
2,"Dear GH Management,   ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,  Stayed 28/9-1/10 4D3N  28/9 1st night I brought my family (with 2 kids age 7&6) to come staying at your hotel for 3 nights attending a friend's wedding ceremony plus reception. I was being put in Room 3208 upon my arrival and it turned out to be directly next to the Indian Groom's suite and they started having a party from 10:30pm which got louder and louder and left us with no choice to to make a fugitive run to room 3331 suggested by your deputy manager Hery who didn't informed us there will be a wedding banquet being hosted right outside this room afterwards. Packing up all luggages, me and my wife carrying two deep sleeping kids(one weighted 35kg) approaching midnight is not ideal at all.  29/9 2nd night The worse were to follow. The…"
5,"Our stay at the Hyatt was exceptional.  Upon arrival we were greeted by many friendly faces that made it very clear they were there to serve you in anyway they possibly could. The staff was amazing and they made our trip worth every penny. All in all, the service we received here truly went beyond our expectations and we are so glad we chose this place.  Again,thanks for making our stay so amazing !"

2,I just came back from a 6-nights stay at Grand Hyatt Bali. I did a lot of research online before booking a hotel in Nusa Dua but I am afraid got it terribly wrong. I have written 3 emails (2 during the stay and 1 just before posting this review) to the hotel about various issues I faced from the beginning of my stay. Long story short: 1) They are probably understaffed. They won't service you if you are a single room booking as most of their staff is busy servicing group booking customers. They would plainly refuse for basic services like in-room dining saying they are busy 2) You would think you have access to the whole property during your stay but one restaurant or another or the bar would be almost always be exclusively booked by a group. I ate most of my food outside the…
4,"Recently I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali on the beach in Nusa Dua. The check-in procedure was made in the Grand Club Lounge without joining them at the desk, I just handed them over my passport and credit card, which they returned to me shortly afterwards. That‘s why I immediatelly could start with dinner in the lounge. The lounge itself you can find outside with a roof and surrounded by a pond with some colorful fishes. Staff was very charming, but especially while explaining the dishes. Selection of food was good and my favorite thing to eat was a spicy salad with young papaya! As I received a room upgrade they put me in one of their suites which I was very pleased of! The room was very spacious with living area, dining area, bedroom, dressing room, guest bathroom and a huge…"
1,"I'm not sure who allocates the star rating to hotels but they need to be advised that this hotel is nowhere near 5 star and should be rated a 3 star at best. Whilst we were there for 5 Nights, there were two Weddings and a Russian conference. Unfortunately one of the weddings went for four days of celebrations and kept us awake 3 of the nights with loud music and disrespectful rude guests staggering back to their room at 5 a.m. we could also hear a gentleman snoring in the next room due to paper thin doors that divide the rooms. If you decide to go to this hotel do not go to The West Wing which is like living in the slums. The rooms were very outdated, dirty and the bathroom was mouldy with no cleaning in the time we stayed there. The pools were tired and broken. The water was…"
5,"This hotel can be described as paradise !  I will discuss 3 points to give you a clear picture of the hotel :  1- The rooms: The hotel rooms are huge and very clean , the only comment that I will say that the furniture looks old a little bit but beside that everything is perfect specially the service , staff were smiling and helpful all the time.  2- The hotel facilities : A- You will have access to one of the best private beaches in Bali which is perfect for swimming or even long walks with your beloved people. B-The swimming pool is relatively small with such a huge hotel and it can get crowded sometimes. C-The hotel has a really nice green area (park ) where you can walk and enjoy and I think the pictures of the hotel electorate that clearly.  D- the hotel has one restaurant…"

The entire hotel from start to finish was perfect. I wish i could have stayed longer and will be back. "

3,"1/ When we arrived we were told there was no booking for us (which was booked months before) 2/ Finally a room became available after a very long wait, it was way up the back end of the hotel which felt very disconnected from the rest, a very long walk with terrible gardens, very disappointing."
5,"Location + resort design + fasilitirs available are all amazing ...  also we had easy access to the beach  Staff are very nice , SPA is the best ever!! Even though the hotel is it new , but it is amazing when it comes to the building status We loved it"
5,"We stayed 8 nights on a luxury escapes deal and was delighted. The hotel is a little bit old but that's what appealed to me, old school Bali feel with amazing established gardens and superb pools with plenty of shaded beds to go around . Service was classic friendly bali with a genuine smile! The beach was cleanest I've seen in Bali, and the kids loved the water slide. We will be back. "
4,"Great place. Had a club room. Club lounge great. Only issue was a conference being conducted for some of our stay. Conference was by Russian company with 800 delegates. Had no impact on club lounge or pool but no idea about non smoking in areas and rules. Still great staff, lovely, peaceful, tranquil and away from maddening crowds."
5,"Amazing grounds and fantastic warm and welcoming staff, I would suggest you search YouTube for some great videos of the hotel but rest assured they don't do it justice. We did have strolls in both directions along the beech and not only did we feel that the Grand Hyatt was most appealing we also felt that by far space was good in the fact you was not sitting on top of another guest during sunbathing either around the pool or the beech. Fantastic all round no grumbles from English couple "

4,"We have just returned from our 3rd stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali over 3 years. This hotel is no longer 5 stars, more 3.5 to 4 stars. Standards have slipped in terms of rooms needing updating, pool area needing upgrading and cleaning and changes to the lobby lounge area and lack of happy hour being backward steps. Kids club, drinks and food are expensive. The saving grace of the Grand Hyatt is the magnificent gardens and breathtaking scenes as you stand in the lobby area, the beautiful beach and location to the Bali Collection for choice of eateries etc. With a bit of investment, attention to detail and listening to guests feedback the hotel can become great once more."
3,"The grand Hyatt facilities and grounds were exception, many pools to chose from, picturesque grounds BUT there was never anything happening around the place. No music except around checkin time, it would have been nice to have it at other times rather than just trying to create a great first impression. Afternoon cocktails would have been better with music, even if it was recorded and not live.  Our room was beautiful and we faced the emerald pool which was always quiet and often I would be the only one using it. Same with the gym pool, beautiful surroundings with only me in it. The gym is well equipped and includes a steam room and sauna.  Restaurants served great food, although food and drinks were very expensive. Table water is never offered, you have to pay extra as well as…"
3,"I stayed for 1 night during September 17 to 18, 2017.   The pros:  1. The pools are awesome. Each pool has its own feel, our favorite was the river pool. 2. The beach. You really cannot vault the Nusa Dua Beach at the hotel area, the water was crystal clear (clearer than the beach north of the water blow)  The cons: 1. As a World of Hyatt member, they didn't give any effort to recognize the member. Even though its stated in the reservation form.  2. The staff were not that attentive for a 5 star resort. We didn't get any cold shoulder moment, but this area should be improved  The standard classic resort room size was big and have a massive daybed in front of the TV.   The breakfast was also average."
5,"This hotel is just perfect.  Reception and lobby area are fantastic and staff immediately appears friendly. I upgraded to a Club room which allowed access to the Grand Club providing happy hour from 5pm to 7pm and also fantastic buffet breakfast.  Access to a really nice beach and pools with great variation, different restaurants and shops.  The gym is well equipped and classes are available too.  Staff at Grand Club is just amazing"
4,"5 stars to the grounds, pools, staff and restaurants. 3 stars to the room. All the resort needs is a refurbish of the rooms to be completely luxurious again.  I have to say though that the drinks need repricing. $5 AUD for a small water or can of coke is a joke, that's high for Aus standards, never mind Bali. We found the food reasonably priced however.  Overall we enjoyed our stay and do not regret choosing Grand Hyatt Bali. "

2,"Booked with Luxury Escapes 8 nt package for our honeymoon & the property did not live up to expectations.  Checked out a day early & went back to Padma Legian!  Paid upgrade to ocean/sea view, room was in need of TLC. Very dated. Sliding door to balcony was so stiff we both hurt our backs opening & closing it. Air con was on lowest temp setting & going non stop but room did not get cooler than 25degrees, even with blinds & door closed for a full day/night.   Fridge did not cool the drinks - milk went off overnight. Reported to hotel who checked & said nothing wrong with the fridge. After repeated requests they replaced the fridge which cooled the drinks only a little bit better.  Tech cleaned out air con filter- no change.  Maintenance did something to the balcony door - made it…"
4,"Absolutely magnificent resort of mega dimensions in one of the best parts of Bali.  The people are great, the grounds are spectacular, the restaurants are very good, The only letdown would have to be the aging rooms.  They are so 70's and certainly the one we stayed in it had certainly seen better days- Grand Hyatt, you need to fix this tribe truly five star. Other than that very close to perfect resort."
5,"Having  previously been to Bali many times staying in Kuta and Sunar, we booked the Grand Bali Hyatt Nusa Dua for a change.  We also decided to try a Luxury Escape eight night deal for the first time.  As it turned out we actually stayed 13 nights and used two packages as our daughter and her family (who we booked for) were not able to make the trip.  Overall the hotel is excellent. It is of an older grand style, well maintained with an expansive layout, beautiful gardens and pool area which is one of best we have seen anywhere.   We stayed in room 1437 which was very comfortable in terms of size and layout and well maintained.    The staff were consistently very friendly and helpful providing a high standard of service during our stay.  Given it was our first time using a…"
5,"Nice stay, everything is good, nice soft sand beach, pool and ***speechless, overall -Hotel is one of the best in Bali Nusa Dua and highly recommended if you are visiting Bali especially for Nusa Dua area."
5,"Sincerely was very satisfied with my whole experience.  I felt that every little detail was addressed and taken care of. I had no need to worry about a thing. There was great customer service.   The night that I was flying out, was not until 0130 on the morning after check out. I was able to check my baggage and have another full day of play. When I returned to the hotel, I retrieve and recheck my baggage and take advantage of the fitness center to shower and prepare for my travels. Then I had an amazing last meal. This was greatly appreciated since I was facing a full day plus of travel back to home.  Beautiful room and hotel grounds with amazing views. I never felt as if I needed to be cautious of cleanliness. I always had more than enough amenities provided (shampoo,…"

5,"Back to the Grand Hyatt recently and it is still quite outstanding.  The way in which the facilities have been maintained over the years is a credit to the management and staff.  The gardens, pools and ponds and all of their associated features are great.  Beach frontage is well maintained and regularly cleaned and the trees on the beach make for great shady spots. Yes, somethings are more expensive than some other places, but can never begrudge that when the facilities are so extensive and so well maintained. Staff are first class and ever ready to assist.  Would not hesitate to return."
5,Excellent quiet hotel on a lovely beach. Plenty of deck chairs with lovely shady trees.Staff were great and our room was on a lagoon where we watched the water birds. Food was enjoyable and we liked the traditional dancing. Breakfast was extra good.
4,"I really enjoy my time in this hotel. Though it was opened quite many years ago and it is still maintained the quality. Lovely staff, spot on meals, this place remains lovely. I love the swimming pool too."
5,Wonderfully spacious room with large bathroom and decent sized balcony. Absolutely beautiful gardens which include ponds filled with giant carp and abundant flowering water lillies. All too easy to get lost within the resort grounds which is perhaps something to be mindful of if traveling with kids or elderly people.  The resort has great facilities for conferences/special events.   Private beaches and shopping are within walking distance. No need for haggling as items are at a fixed price.   Quiet location.
5,"Really enjoyed our stay here, was a great spot for the kids with magnificent pools and a slide which they couldn't get enough of. We got an upgrade to a suite which really topped off our stay. The room was beautiful with plenty of space for my wife and kids"

5,"My fiancé and I stayed here and absolutely loved every minute of our stay. This was our first time to nusa dua as we usually stay in seminyak.  We managed to try most of the amazing restaurants but must say the Japanese restaurant is one not to miss.. food was Devine and very fresh, staff were extremely knowledgeable and friendly.   Few cocktails by the pool is fantastic and the salsa bar view is magnificent for sunset.  Will definitely be returning sooner rather than later."
5,"We had high hopes from the Hotel and it sure did meet all our expectations. The Hotel property is huge with lush green gardens, multiple ponds with fishes and all the fauna. There are a couple of restaurants to lure you with their delicacies. Our favourite was the Italian Salsa Verde. But along with the Garden Cafe and Pasar together wont let you worry about cuisine for sure. You get it all here. There are mini stores and night market stalls within the property for you to explore during your leisure walks within and a great shopping centre just adjacent to property entrance.   Some of the great destinations are just a walk away like the beach, Nusa Dual Theatre, Shopping centre, Water Blow etc. Certain section of the beach is also accessible from within the property but we…"
4,"We did the luxury escape package as a starting point for six weeks in Bali. Checking in was slow but friendly by Hyatt standards.  Room was nice and as advertised, inclusions were easily accessible and staff very friendly and accommodating.  Beach out the front was not safe for swimming but short stroll to swimming beach was beautiful.  Pool were a hit with kids 10and 12 although we all ended up with ear infections so bring some antibiotics with you from Australia or buy some at local supermarkets. Don't book activity through resort as about 1/3 the price if your driver organises for you.  Beer not cheap same as home so stock your fridge😃. Food was good and safe even ice and salad.

4,"It is almost 20 years so nice we travelled to Bali.  We will definitely be back soon for another stay at the Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua.  We travelled with another couple and found this resort to exceed our expectations."
4,"It was a relaxing stay. The food is good, deluxe rooms are good. We enjoyed the club access though the breakfast there is continental and limited. The pools are fine but can be crowded. Service was excellent and we had a nice time. It is a little dated but it would be good for the family or a chilled few days away."
5,"My fiancé and I stayed here and absolutely loved every minute of our stay. This was our first time to nusa dua as we usually stay in seminyak.  We managed to try most of the amazing restaurants but must say the Japanese restaurant is one not to miss.. food was Devine and very fresh, staff were extremely knowledgeable and friendly.   Few cocktails by the pool is fantastic and the salsa bar view is magnificent for sunset.  Will definitely be returning sooner rather than later."
5,"We had high hopes from the Hotel and it sure did meet all our expectations. The Hotel property is huge with lush green gardens, multiple ponds with fishes and all the fauna. There are a couple of restaurants to lure you with their delicacies. Our favourite was the Italian Salsa Verde. But along with the Garden Cafe and Pasar together wont let you worry about cuisine for sure. You get it all here. There are mini stores and night market stalls within the property for you to explore during your leisure walks within and a great shopping centre just adjacent to property entrance.   Some of the great destinations are just a walk away like the beach, Nusa Dual Theatre, Shopping centre, Water Blow etc. Certain section of the beach is also accessible from within the property but we…"
4,"We did the luxury escape package as a starting point for six weeks in Bali. Checking in was slow but friendly by Hyatt standards.  Room was nice and as advertised, inclusions were easily accessible and staff very friendly and accommodating.  Beach out the front was not safe for swimming but short stroll to swimming beach was beautiful.  Pool were a hit with kids 10and 12 although we all ended up with ear infections so bring some antibiotics with you from Australia or buy some at local supermarkets. Don't book activity through resort as about 1/3 the price if your driver organises for you.  Beer not cheap same as home so stock your fridge😃. Food was good and safe even ice and salad.

4,We stayed in this hotel as part of a luxury escapes package for eight nights from the 1st to the 9th September. We had paid more for an upgrade to either a lagoon view room or a secret emerald pool room and I had emailed them several times to ask for confirmation we would get the upgrade we had paid for and they confirmed by email we would. However on arrival after a 2 hour wait for our room we were shown into a very tired room in the south village overlooking a small pond and when I asked was this a lagoon view room the lady showing us to the room replied yes which was a little porkie. Not satisfied with the room condition or view I asked to see the client service manager who then claimed they had no lagoon view rooms just pond view rooms even more confusing the outcome of…
5,"If you looking for beautiful, swimmable, quite, and calm beach especially for fun with your family, Nusa Dua Beach should be your first option. Combining with great pool and scenery provided by Hyatt hotel, that would be unforgotten beach vacation for your kids!  Now if you looking at exact property review, read on:  1. As others said, overall the property is huge. Very huge. If you in 4th floor, it will took ~7 minutes walk from the front of your room until you comes in either beach, restaurants (for breakfast), or lobby.  2. Room is great. Some says tired/old. But personally, so what? As long as the building could hold me standing or jumping in the room (I didn't. really?), old/tired building has nothing to do with my comfortability. And as far as I can see, they maintain…"
1,"My worst hotel experience ever what a rort I came from a magnificent week in Ubud to this place to meet my wife who flew in for a conference  We were quoted conference rate of $180/night charged $350 and the smoke and mirrors from the manager at the front desk was extremely frustrating  The place reminds me of a prison camp  Having been to Bali many times I pity any one who comes and stays here and thinks this place is a Balinese experience.. it is a nightmare  The tired, out dated room had a very bad smell, our second room had the same smell, an unpleasant old water smell.  Luggage transfer from one room to the next to 8 hours and 3 phone calls.  No towels left in our room so had to use hand towels after showering. Apologies given by the staff who eventually deliver your…"
4,"We found the overall experience excellent, we had the Luxury escape package and found all of the ""add on's"" to be excellent.Location was peaceful and quiet but close to Bali Connections for some basic amenities and for dining out, It is only a quick cab ride into Kuta for a days shopping."
4,"Stayed for a conference. Rooms clean, big beds. Hard to work air con. Friendly staff. Great pools. Service around bar a bit slow. Salsa bar very serene. A very big resort. Overall a pleasant stay. Not sure I could afford it if it wasn't work!"

5,"Fabulous for work conferences, can't wait to go back with the family for play next year! The service - no matter where I was just warm and welcoming. Location is optimal with beach and shops on doorstep. "
4,"I last stayed here shortly after the Grand Hyatt opened 25+ years ago. This time was there for a conference. The hotel and gardens are enormous, yet spaced so that you don't ever feel crowded or that there are lots of others around. Beautiful traditional Balinese architecture and styling and of course ever-friendly Balinese service.   Nit picking - the rooms are starting to show a little wear and tear.  Also while they preport to be environmentally conscious, surely in this day and age hotels can provide drinkable tap water (filters? bubblers with reusable bottles?) rather what must end up being hundreds of thousand of throwaway plastic bottles that will likely end up in the beautiful ocean that it borders. You can take a lead on this, Grand Hyatt...! "
2,for the price I have paid for this hotel I expected a better room and better services. the room had lots of insects and the AC doesn't work properly.  The way we were treated at the first day wasn't nice although they tried to be much nicer for the rest of our stay there. 
5,"I stayed 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua as part of a business conference. The room had traditional Balinese features and had everything I needed including a VERY comfortable bed! The resort is lovely and features a couple of great bars and restaurants which all served delicious meals. The size of the grounds sometimes made it a bit annoying to have to walk so far to get to the pool, reception or gym but all in all a beautiful resort and I would stay again for sure."
5,Nice place to stay.  The resort very luxury and good view for the beach.  Reception  staff very friendly  and accommodate  all we need.  Stay 2 days really  not enough to enjoy this resort.  3 days minimum  will be better .

2,"The hotel location, beach and pools are nice however the rooms are really dated and in desperate need of repairs and improvements.  Grand Hyatt Bali Team- It's time to invest some money back into the hotel and start doing improvements and repairs to the hotel rooms. I stayed in 3 different rooms over the course of my stays and I each one needed repairs/improvements."
3,the beach and pool are nice enough. the hotel ground is very nice but.....  - the room is a bit tired and the housekeeping need to improve the cleaness of the room   - food is overpriced and nothing special  - never underhand why the mini bar was not refilled on daily basis  - the pool and beach chairs should be replaced to newer ones   - the acoustic of the room is very bad  
5,"The facilities were wonderful and grandiose to say the least. We stayed for 8 nights with a luxury escape package and were overindulged with service, food, location and amenities. The staff are lovely and will do anything for you. There is an amazing pool that twists around the resort and deck chairs everywhere.  The resort is right on the beach with beautiful breezes. Deck chairs are abundant on the beach and staff come and take orders for food and drink. The resort is massive and our package included airport transfers, a cocktail each night, breakfast every day, an hour long massage and 4 nightly meals ( one with a show)."
3,"Firstly there is a serious issue with the public toilets, they are always dirty (water all over the floor, pee everywhere, toilets blocked....), almost every time we used them we had to ask for them to be cleaned, dreadful really, but an easy fix if the Hyatt create an SOP with a schedule for staff to check the toilets, we recommended this to staff. Our room had a beautiful ocean view and the room itself was ok, however there was no evening turn down and the coffee making facilities are a kettle and some nescafe sachets...really this is far from being 5 star. Food - was so so, nothing to get excited about, we had to nego with staff over a bottle of wine as none of the reasonably priced wines were in stock, as a resident of Bali I understand obtaining wine isn't always easy,…"
4,I stayed here for a few nights while a girlfriend was also in Bali that didn't want to stay outside of Nusa Dua for safety reasons. I'm not really a resort person and the biggest reason for that is because I don't like large crowds or being in the family pool. That said the food and service at the Grand Hyatt are impeccable. You're spoiled for choice at the grounds are so large and the beach is in excellent condition. All of that said the experience is a little too impersonal for my taste. This is an amazing option for families or larger groups of travelers that don't want to interact with locals or experience much Balinese culture.

3,I visited Grand Hyatt in August with my family.  We booked 3 rooms in total.  Really nice pool and beach.  The food was nice and many sites to eat at.  It is a large resort so good for a walk.    All the staff were very polite and always greeting - which was lovely.  The Manager on the other hand has very poor management skills.  We waited to see him for 30 min on day one but he was apparently too busy to meet his customers.  We went back later - but still too busy.  We stayed 8 nights and not once did he attempt to find out what we wanted to talk to him about.  Very poor management .
4,"My boyfriend and I stayed for 12 nights here in June. Although it is paradise, there is some room for improvements.   ROOM: We were in block 4 which is right by the breakfast bar. Upon entering our room, it was nice. Did not make us think 'wow' but it was comfortable. The balcony overlooked the lake which was nice with the ducks and fish. One thing that was slightly strange was the wardrobe and cabinets for clothing was located in the bathroom..  GROUNDS: Could not fault the grounds and area of the hotel, everything was so tidy and there is always staff around to maintain the grass and keep it clean.  POOLS:/BEACH: Again, could not fault the pools, plenty of sun loungers around the pool. The river pool is great also and the fact there's a slide which is suitable for all ages.…"
4,"The Grand Hyatt in Bali is an amazing place, from the time you enter to the time you depart.  We ended our Bali holiday with a 4 day stay at the Grand Hyatt, and for the kids and family it was perfect.   They greeted us very kindly at the entry with a customary beating of the drum. We arrived early, and they kindly accommodated us until our room was ready, which was a few hours before 2pm. They also managed to get our family rooms located VERY close to ours, which was great.   The rooms worked well, and they were cleaned every day with regular bottled water refreshed everyday.   The pool was the best part of our stay and occupied our kids for hours upon hours. The water slide was just perfect for our 7yo, but they could have had more to do for our 3yo. The toddler pool was not…"
5,"We had 6 nights in a club room and loved it! The grounds are amazing, our room was lovely and the pools and beach were beautiful.  The only negative I had is we were on a holiday to celebrate our 25th anniversary and had a total of 4 hotels booked on the trip, our travel agent told all of the hotels and the only one that didn't give us a cake to celebrate was the Grand Hyatt!"
5,"My wife and I spent 4 days at the Grand Hyatt and enjoyed everyone one of them. The hotel is beautifully laid out, the staff is very warm and welcoming, and the food is very good. We stayed in a Club room, which I would highly recommend as it gave us access to the lounge (breakfast, snacks and happy hour everyday) and a private pool. A very large beach is a stones throw away. Nusa is a great place to relax and the Grand Hyatt makes it very easy."

5,"One of the more unforgettable experience. Grand Hyatt Bali has almost everything that a family vacation should have. The pools are fantastic with 1.2M at most. So kids or poor swimmers are able to enjoy the swimming facilities as well. The slides are especially popular with the Kids. We travel with a 2.5 yr old toddler. The rooms are however a little old with the kettle looking a little worn out. The rooms are however big enough for kids to run about. Because the many rooms available, queuing during check in took a little long. Would recommend this hotel to friends. Restaurants in the Hotel are a little steep on Price. We took a 5 mins walk outside to Bali Collections where there are plenty of restaurants and Cafes available at reasonable price. Overall, great job by Grand Hyatt."
5,"Amazingly beautiful resort with lush gardens and multiple pools. The hotel consists of several ""villages"", which is great, as it doesn't feel like a cramped and packed 600+ rooms hotel. The beach is beautiful and there are plenty of sunbeds. We had lunch and dinner at Salsa Verde; they serve delicious Italian food.Throughout the hotel, the staff is extremely friendly and super helpful. In my opinion the best hotel in Nusa Dua."
2,A resort not befitting the Grand Hyatt brand name and reputation one is accustomed to. A dated hotel too spread out. The breakfast cafe was most disappointing - minimal food choices; practically no vegetarian options and small area.
5,"We stayed in this magnificent hotel for the second time and this place is the best for service and cleanliness. Nothing is too much trouble for the excellent staff which is a reflection on the quality of the management. Clean rooms, great breakfast, awesome pool and gym. Hot and cold spas to make you feel amazing. Can not fault this ah amazing resort. Restaurant meals are faultless. Walking distance to the Bali Collection shopping mall and restaurants is another bonus of the location of the Grand Hyatt. Beautiful beaches on your door step and much more. Do yourself a favour and book here. You will not be disappointed."
4,One of our most memorable holidays in this lovely Hotel was enhanced by the charming staff who always smiled with a genuine aim to please.  The gardens are exquisite and well deserving of their famous reputation.  We will hope to visit again in the not too distant future.

4,"Hotel  We previously stayed at the hotel back in 2011 and have found it to still be as beautiful as ever!  The weather in August is great. It's hot and sunny with around 12hrs of sun per day. It can be cloudy until around 10am but this does clear and there's a breeze to offer some light relief.  The hotel's public areas are modern in style and some have been refurbished since we last visited. For instance, the Grand Club Lounge has been extended and more modern features have been added to this (more details on this later).  One of the benefits of staying here, is the size of plot the hotel sits on - its huge! This means that even though it has over 600 rooms it still feels spacious. There's plenty of sun loungers on the beach and around the many pools. When visiting, we explored…"
3,"Nusa dua is a very well maintained ""Gated Community"" of hotels, the feel is very nice and posh and you are welcomed with huge entrances and very nicely maintained gardens.... Grand Hyatt is also the same, huge welcoming reception and a breathtaking view of the sea.. amazing grounds and an exceptionally well maintained pool, lawns, beach etc. etc. etc. but that's about it, the rooms are dated, old, smelly, bathrooms have broken sink faucets and even the french window blinds between the rooms don't work.. you will feel sand on your feet inside the room...  didn't expect this after paying extra for the ocean view room...  the staff is not what you will generally find in Bali, they are very clinical and robotic, not the warmth that you will find in the other locations like seminyak…"
5,"What isn't there to like about the Grand Hyatt Bali - stayed in Room 3359 on a Luxury Escapes package - worth every dollar and certainly value for money with the add ons. The staff are fantastic and very friendly. Had a romantic final dinner with complimentary flowers and a candle, plus desert on the house - what a way to end our holiday.The meals and breakfasts we thought were very good. Just 10 minutes from the Bali Collection (a shopping centre by another name) ... wine, Bingtangs and snacks are just minutes away. The gardens are amazing, literally a blaze of colour and ponds - loved Alu (the water lizard) and carp. The beach is literally on the hotel's doorstep, but the undiscovered areas we liked were the Bay Club and Bali Pool - perfect if you want to chill and have some…"
5,This is a faboulous place People Food Sight seeing Balance earth sea and sky Opens your  mind heart and spirit The rooms are great The staff is greater  And the food is fantastic Service is a holiday  In itself the people here truely welcome Everyone with joy and kindness  From time you arrive Its amazingly simply beautful
3,"Just returned from a two week stay at the Grand Hyatt and must admit we are both missing it......well......parts!!!   On arrival we were both pleasantly surprised by the lovely reception area and the staff were very welcoming. After a quick walk through just some of the huge hotel grounds we came to our room(3238)...........first impressions were that it was a bit dated....but lovely nevertheless....   The only negative comments are that the shower area did smell a bit funny, a kind of damp smell like it hadn't been used for awhile. There were all the usual things tea,coffee all the shower and conditioner for the bathroom it was all there.The mini cabinet only had two small glasses and looked like the door was just about to fall off. Needs some care and attention.  We had a…"

The beach is literally on the hotel's doorstep, but the undiscovered areas we liked were the Bay Club and Bali Pool - perfect if you want to chill and have some…"
5,This is a faboulous place People Food Sight seeing Balance earth sea and sky Opens your  mind heart and spirit The rooms are great The staff is greater  And the food is fantastic Service is a holiday  In itself the people here truely welcome Everyone with joy and kindness  From time you arrive Its amazingly simply beautful
3,"Just returned from a two week stay at the Grand Hyatt and must admit we are both missing it......well......parts!!!   On arrival we were both pleasantly surprised by the lovely reception area and the staff were very welcoming. After a quick walk through just some of the huge hotel grounds we came to our room(3238)...........first impressions were that it was a bit dated....but lovely nevertheless....   The only negative comments are that the shower area did smell a bit funny, a kind of damp smell like it hadn't been used for awhile. There were all the usual things tea,coffee all the shower and conditioner for the bathroom it was all there.The mini cabinet only had two small glasses and looked like the door was just about to fall off. Needs some care and attention.  We had a…"
5," Another lovely family vacation, Great location, top staff, excellent F&B, you won't be disappointed!! Staff can't do enough, the attention to detail is superb, lovely grounds on an excellent beach, and if your in the club rooms, the lounge and it's staff are just great!!  We will be returning!!"
5,"It was a pleasure to stay in Grand Hyatt Bali. Everything was perfect. For me the room is very interesting with the balcony outside, big sofa, and the room size is quite large eventho for standard room. Staff very helpful, service was very excellent and fast.  I do love the swimming pool with cave concept. Such a relaxing moment when in Bali."
3,"Stayed at the Grand Club rooms and reserved two rooms for my family and the parents in law for two nights. Below are my impression during our stay:  The good:  1. Great private beach and pools.   2. The hotel fill with wild life with very nice landscape. 3. The rooms located in the middle, between the beach and the front lobby.  The bad: 1. There was miss-communication when I reserved the rooms, the impression that I had from the information given that the Grand Club ROOM has free coffee, tea and sodas in the fridge, it turns out the free sodas only on their lounge club.  2. The room was quite old. 3. The TV size between the two rooms were different, in one room was smaller.  4. The bathtub in my room has problem with the drainage plug and I asked the Grand Club front office for…"
5,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this impressive Resort. Beach with white sand, blue sea and decent surf. Several high-end restaurants to choose from and additional restaurants and shops within few minutes walk at a shopping mall. The gym is 24 hrs open. Staff were happy to help wherever they could."
5,We stayed 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt Bali as part of our Bali vacation. This is our third stay at this hotel and this time was no exception; we were not disappointed! We have booked the Ambassador Suit this time and it was amazing by all standards. Really big and with all what you need to make your stay a relaxing one. The view from the huge balcony is something we started and ended our day with. Got used to the amazing sound of waives every night before bed! Beach was nice and the kids enjoyed it every single day. It was clean and fun to spend time just lazing around with a book and a drink.  We tried the Japanese restaurant at the Grand Hyatt and the food was unbelievable. Tried the teppanyaki grill and the Sake cocktails they have. Good service and fun atmosphere. Service by…

5,"A fantstic place to stay. I couldn't remecommend it enough. if you can do stay in the Grand Clun - the staff are amazing, its worth the extra money and you do get treated extremely well. This is a great place for families. There is lots to do, its a safe piece of paradise. We are fussy where we stay but have been coming back year on year for the past 10 years. Despite being to other places as well we find it impossible too much the serenity, the facilities, the personal service and the overall quality. Brilliant"
5,"Huge resort with beautiful gardens and impressive pools. Perfect service, lovely restaurants, nice beach ( its possible to swim!), good WiFi, excellent gym. Located at Nusa Dua BTDC, a tourist enclave but incredibly well maintained and safe."
5,"Arrived here after a busy 4 nights in Singapore and just what was needed On arrival we were shown to our room which was so spacious  and overlooking a pond laden with lilies, amazing wildlife on view, water lizards koi carp, ducks and a variety of birds which I've never seen before We only had breakfast here which was superb, the staff very friendly and efficient in finding you a table,the people on the omelette station were very friendly The hotel overlooks a great beach which was very quiet The BAli collection over the road from the hotel had a great selection of restaurants most reasonably priced, a large beer generally priced at just over £2 Our favourites being coco and Bali Prada which had a great duo playing every night They also provided a cake when they found out it was…"
3,"Not what I expected!! Hotel rather dated and rooms are small and no storage to put anything away. Now I know your room is only to sleep in? But you have to be comfortable. The place is massive, in a way too big, can't just let your kids run around! Have to be with them. Food was ok but the breakfast was very disappointing. Just lacking in every way and very basic menu.  There isn't much to do on a night unless you go out of hotel. Everything closes very early including the bar. So for facilities and pool that is the only great point they have everything with a cost of course. If it was me for families go to Westin a lot cheaper and great pools or the Laguna spa which is next door to Westin and you can use both hotels facilities "
4,"I booked the Grant Hyatt for my honeymoon because I used points as well as my anniversary reward night for 3 of the 6 nights I was in Bali. Upon arrival, I was greeted by many staff members as well as cold drinks and towels. After a long day and car ride, it was very refreshing. I was escorted to the World of Hyatt desk for check in and eventually escorted to the room where we were given a tour.   The facility is EXTREMELY big - took us a few days to understand where everything was. Few options for dining, few pool areas and minutes from the beach."

5,"We stayed for 10 nights and enjoyed every day there:  recommend the Balinese Emerald Pool and the Bay Club Fitness Centre pool for quiet locations away from the more family-focused Lagoon & River pools.  The gardens are sumptuous, beautiful and full,of bird life so walking around the resort was a walk of wonder.  Staff were always friendly and service impeccable.  Close to Bali Collection for a range of meals and shopping.  The Kriya Spa massage was relaxing and a delightful experience with a cup of tea by the pond afterwards."
4,"We stayed in the Grand Hyatt after the trip to ubud. The hotel is a little bit outdated, the gardens and swimming pools are very beautiful but overcrowded, furniture is cheap. Breakfast in buffet restaurant not of high quality. Another level if you book a club room. The private swimming pool is really lovely, only for club guests and very quiet. The club lounge offers a good choice of canapes and drinks (inclusive sparkling wine). Rooms are a bit older but surely are charming. The difference between club rooms and non club rooms is really substantial !!"
3,"Firstly, let's start on a positive note. The pools are amongst the grandest in Bali, there are three. The best of which mimics a natural rock, swim-through set of small and tall islands.  Unfortunately the rest of the resort has seen much better days and is in need of an overhaul. The common areas, the shopping mall, the gardens need a refresh with a design aesthetic that warrants the marque of the Grand Hyatt.   The interior design of the rooms are old and barely adequate, tired and missing the attention to detail and proper finish you'd expect, with chipped paint, stains and other finishing touches that shouldn't be visible for a guest.  Although the service was probably ok, the incredibly overpriced breakfast was the absolute worst hotel buffet I've ever experienced. If you…"
5,"I stayed at Grand Hyatt with my family, including an infant. I took a room with a day bed and the hotel provided a baby cot free of cost. The room was quite big and even after the baby crib, there was plenty of room. The hotel has a great pool wit a couple of water slides that my older daughter loved. The pools are all interconnected and quite big. The beach is right outside the hotel and is quite good. There is also a Kids club to keep the ids occupied. The staff were great and very helpful."
1,"My wife was cut by a broken glass table top at Hyatts property in Bali and after admitting thier neglience when faced with the bills for medical care and time lost from her profession their response was Bali and Indonesian law doesnt care about damages. The hotel tried to push this under the table and referred us to their Insurance carrier AIG and the result was similar ,Bali is different then the rest of the world. We have turned this over to an attorney. Please be cautious of the smiling faces,they mask indifference and ignorance."

4,"Excellent location, facilities, and especially staff: very large site - not totally suitable for those mobility impaired visitors: some room furniture looking old and tired - needs updating: local shuttle service would be a benefit"

5,"We booked our holiday with Virgin and upon arrival at the airport we were greeted by a friendly host and a private transfer cab which took us a short 20 minute cab ride to our  hotel, which over looked the Bali sea! Upon arrival, despite it being about 1am and dark, we were greeted by the most beautiful reception area, surrounded by ponds filled with beautiful flowers and lilypads (see my pictures!) The staff at the hotel are incredibly friendly and eager to meet your every need. Upon arrival we were presented with a complimentary meal in one of the beautiful restaurants inside the hotel, and also a 30 minute massage in the spa - which is also one of the most aesthetic ones I have ever seen!   The rooms themselves are also amazing - a huge king size bed which meant my friend and…"

You pay for a 5 star hotel and receive the service...  we specially enjoyed the animals walking around the hotel (saw a monkey, giant lizards, and some other animals) "

5,"We were there for three nights, me, my wife and my 4 months baby daughter and we had a great time. We planned our trip just to stay and relax in the hotel and we did it. We had a very relaxing time and the hotel provided us a very nice weekend! It all started with the warm welcome in the afternoon with easy check in. We were asked to wait for a while to have our room ready, and yes, it was only a 10 minutes waiting (with nice cold welcoming drinks and cold towels). The room was nice, and since we have have asked for a baby cot, they provided it as per our request, plus with additional baby bath tub. We have no complains about the room, the hotel, the service. 1. Service: very friendly people with good service.  2. Room: Our room was an old room (I think the hotel IS an old hotel…"
1,"Staff incompetent and untrustworthy.  We ordered a baby car seat for airport arrival transfer and it was not provided. (We later found out that other friends in Perth had the same thing happen to them at this shamozzle of a hotel).  They blamed us for not ordering it and it was only after we showed their email confirming they would arrange one that they offered us compensation, which was a grossly inadequate and a token gesture. Food average at best.  Staff lied to us on multiple occasions.  Rooms are not sound proofed as advertised and we could clearly hear the people above. Overpriced for Perth, let alone 'Cheap Bali'.  Very poor facilities for kids less than 3 - definitely not family friendly.  Location was the only positive. Be ashamed Grand Hyatt, very ashamed. NEVER AGAIN!"
4,This hotel has got the works. Well appointed rooms with a great swimming pool and a beautiful beach front. Nasa dua is probably the most safest place to stay in Bali so location too is top notch. The spa and it's services is top notch. However I did have issues with the food. Breakfast wasn't of international standards. Would appreciate more variety/quality. The Italian restaurant dined there twice both the time I found the food only satisfactory and room for improvement. The gelato though was excellent. Pasar sengoll the baliness style open market had a buffet running and being a vegetarian I wasn't too keen on going for it due to less vegetarian options ( which is understandable) but they insisted if I had to sit there and watch the baliness performance and not take the buffet…

1,"Noise levels of Nusa Dua Festival next to hotel until 10.00pm week nights and midnight Friday, Saturday and Sunday means that I will not revisit this hotel. Completely unacceptable to pay top hotel prices to have to tolerate this abominable noise every day and night. Simply appalling."
2,"Tonight, Sunday, July 30 I called the Grand Hyatt Bali to send a bottle of wine to an  in-house guest. Six times I rang the hotel and the phone rang for so long that it clicked off and I had to do it again and again. On the seventh ring a gentleman answered and I requested Giest Services. The phone again rang for Guest Services so long the operator came back and said ""sorry all the lines are busy"" at which I responded ""I'll wait"". He then tried again and once I reached the so called Guest Relations Officer, I told her about the phone issue to which she responded ""we apologize"". I then asked for the guest whom I happened to know was staying there and she said no one by that name was staying at the Grand Hyatt and she would connect me to Reservations.

5,"So we decided to have a day at The Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua with the kids mainly to use their large pool facilities. And it also had a slide for the kids.   The pool was amazing, with lots of shade amongst the rocks and coves.   You need to book and the cost is 300k ++ and 150 ++ for kids and well worth it if you want to go somewhere different for the day.   We got a Bluebird taxi from Legian and it cost 120k each way. Just suggest you leave around 8am to avoid traffic and get good lounger locations around the pool.   We ate at the pool restaurant and the service was impeccable and food was good too.  It was 100% full occupancy but because it is so big you it didn't feel overcrowded.  If you have inflatable pool toys take them. They have a pump you can use.  The beach was amazing. …"
5,"Our recent stay at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua was excellent. The resort is huge - lots of grounds to walk around and discover new aspects. The main pool has many parts which link - it is a lagoon style with beautiful landscaping - as the photos on their website show. We secured pool side sun loungers in the mornings to ensure we got to spend the day at our preferred part of the pool. Our standard room was comfortable for 4 (2 adults, one 6 y.o and one 4 y.o). Our children shared the daybed (was plenty big enough for them) The king bed was so big we could have all slept in it! Excessive noise was a problem on a couple of nights for us due to a large convention group staying who were causing many complaints. Our issue was dealt with swiftly by the Duty Manager and we were moved into a…"

5,"Last September, when Luxury Escapes called us and offered us another Grand Hyatt Bali package for 2017, we didn't hesitate. We said YES! Coming back has been just as delightful as our first stay here in 2016 and the hotel standards are still fantastic. We had a week in a private villa in Seminyak at the Nyuh Villas (another Luxury Escapes deal) first, then came down to Nusa Dua for a blissful, quiet 10 days in the quiet luxury of the Hyatt. We visited quite a few major hotels up in the busy part of Seminyak while we were there, including the brand new Indigo, checking out their accommodation options and facilities, but for us the 'old Bali' feel and stately luxury and calmness of the facilities and surrounding gardens of the Grand Hyatt are still the best there is. Their service…"
4,Wonderful grounds and beach. Hotel staff were very welcoming . The rooms were comfortable and breakfast had a good selection. Local Bali collection shopping centre was great and just a short walk away. Hotel restaurants were excellent providing different varieties of food at different prices.
5,"My last stay in grand hyatt was in late July 2017. I have stayed in Grand hyatt bali more than ten times since 2000. Grand hyatt well maintains its proterties in excellent situation both in environment and staff training. In my pinion, the beach is the largest and best within nusa dua area.

5,"Great family hotel in beautiful beachfront location. Fantastic buffet breakfasts and restaurants, yummy cocktails. The pool and slide kept our granddaughter happy so we could relax. The staff were amazing and so helpful. Had a great holiday here"
4,"Definitely it is one of the finest property I have been too . But the sad part is that people at helm of affairs have forgotten that it is a hospitality industry ........ We have come to this place not for any casual visit but basically to celebrate our 25th Anniversary. I very well understand that every hotel has its rules and regulations but at the same time it is very important for them to understand the meaning of word "" Hospitality"". I was very upset when even after requesting them repeatedly to organise something special for us that particular evening , NO positive response was shown by the hotel authorities. Organising a candle light dinner ( obviously paid ) on that evening near the beach was the only requirement but was told by the f&b manager that it is not possible .…"
5,"Last September, when Luxury Escapes called us and offered us another Grand Hyatt Bali package for 2017, we didn't hesitate. We said YES! Coming back has been just as delightful as our first stay here in 2016 and the hotel standards are still fantastic. We had a week in a private villa in Seminyak at the Nyuh Villas (another Luxury Escapes deal) first, then came down to Nusa Dua for a blissful, quiet 10 days in the quiet luxury of the Hyatt. We visited quite a few major hotels up in the busy part of Seminyak while we were there, including the brand new Indigo, checking out their accommodation options and facilities, but for us the 'old Bali' feel and stately luxury and calmness of the facilities and surrounding gardens of the Grand Hyatt are still the best there is. Their service…"
4,Wonderful grounds and beach. Hotel staff were very welcoming . The rooms were comfortable and breakfast had a good selection. Local Bali collection shopping centre was great and just a short walk away. Hotel restaurants were excellent providing different varieties of food at different prices.
5,"My last stay in grand hyatt was in late July 2017. I have stayed in Grand hyatt bali more than ten times since 2000. Grand hyatt well maintains its proterties in excellent situation both in environment and staff training. In my pinion, the beach is the largest and best within nusa dua area. Its tropical gardens are fullfilled with ecological interest that you can find lots of birds, frogs, squirrels and even big lizzards.

5,"Myself and my partner have just returned from a 2 week holiday to Bali. We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 6 nights and we were not disappointed. We arrived at the Hotel after a long drive from Ubud with drinks and a cold towel! Hotel lobby was very impressive. The staff at check in were very friendly and offered us drinks and cold towels. We were upgraded to a Club room on arrival and so our room was located very close to the beach and we have a lovely view of a pond and ground from our balcony. The room itself was very nice. Plenty of space, big comfy bed, shower with separate bath and was very clean. The beach itself was so lovely - white sand and turquoise waters. Breakfast, which was buffet, was great and there was plenty of seating and it never felt overcrowded. Every…"
3,"In 'theory' everything about this place seemed great value, excellent bonuses with luxury escapes packages etc. Paying extra for the VIP upgrade, and an additional fee for an extra room didn't exactly pan out great.  THE BAD: The check in service was slow, uninformed & really impersonal, lacking the lovely bali touch you get elsewhere, also not sure why they give guests red cordial on arrival.  Our room wasn't ready even though we had arrived after 5pm & we couldn't be accommodated in the actual rooms we had purchased.  After multiple requests to move to our purchased room category, we were fobbed off & told resort was at capacity and we eventually gave up.  Thankfully the engineering team weren't as blase, we managed to see them everyday as they attempting to fix our aircon.…"
5,"It has everything you can ask for a luxurious escape.. spas , pools , private beach, restaurants.. every nook and corner aesthetically maintained .. Staff is more than polite and helpful.. A shopping and restaurant  is right in front of the main gate.. Its a world class experience .. Ohh and don't miss the breakfast..They have big spread , freshly cooked and delicious.."
3,"The Hotel is beautiful and the beach is awsome. We got the Luxury Escape deal and it was really good value. Customer Service varied between staff, the worst was Kriya Spa Reception Staff. The Luxury Escape voucher booklets printed by the hotel was poor and showed lack of awareness by spa staff about the deal. Itbecame a painful experience having to explain to the Spa staff each time what is part of the Luxury escape deal. The Balinese Dance with outdoor dining experience was memorable.Customer service at Garden Cafe, Japanese Restaurant & Salsa Bar were the really good."
5,"From the moment we stepped out from Our Limousine we knew we had arrived somewhere very special, the open reception area was stunning, we was greeted and taken to the the reception desk, check in was flawless and was escorted to our room, the room had some nice features and we had our ocean view as promised and we also recommend. Our luggage was brought to us 5 minutes later. The Hotel sits on the beach and is a large complex but is set in immaculate landscapes gardens. with in a day it was easy to get around we had a choice of 2 restaurants to have our breakfast both serving the same food with such a large choice and was replenished constantly. The pools were landscaped beautiful and were not your typical square box with so many sunbeds with unlimited free towels. The beach was…"

Luxury Escape provided lots of free meals & cocktails they were good but make sure you are organised and book ahead to avoid disappointment ( lesson I had to learn ) . My heading The grand China sounds racist & probably is ! I apologise , but there werent many english speaking people there , I was in the minority .

5,"We just returned home from a lovely week spent at the Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua. I can't rate this resort highly enough for the total experience.  Things we found particularly impressive were the friendliness of all staff and quality of the service, the immaculate and expansive grounds, the quality of spa treatments, the location, and on and on.  I read some reviews about the facilities looking a bit ""tired,"" which you could perhaps notice with close scrutiny, but I found all other aspects of the resort of such quality, that the odd chip and scuff didn't register. We bought a voucher from Luxury Escapes and found the value to be exceptional.  The upgraded inclusions were all fantastic, particularly the spa treatments, the champagne brunch and the Teppanyaki dinner. I agree with…"
1,"Had stayed at the Grand Hyatt few times years ago and decided to book it for a night on this trip.   As a Hyatt Diamond member that check in and arrival experience were so bad that decided to cancel my stay on the spot and move to a hotel where they actually provide service.  Person check-in in should welcome the guests first, ask how was their trip and then ask for the names. Seems that the staff here wer just screaming after the passport.  Asked to speak with he manager on duty and another mistrained agent came that was supposedly lobby manager.  Then spoke this gentleman that was supposedly front desk manager. When I spoke to him he as merely looking and addressing my friend.  I have learned that if basic checking in to a hotel is this difficult, is better to cancel the stay…"
3,"We had read reviews that this was a child-friendly resort, and it certainly was very accommodating for my 6 month-old and 3 year-old. Nice beach front location and walking distance to Bali Collections, which is nice to have somewhere else to eat other than the hotel restaurants. Rooms were spacious and the day bed turns into a great bed for a toddler, but unfortunately, I found the resort as a whole to be dated and in need of some updating considering the calibre of the surrounding hotels. Even with the water slide, we only used the pool once or twice during our 3-day stay. Also wasn't overly impressed by the hospitality of the staff which I find unusual for Bali. Overall, I wasn't unhappy with the property, but also not terribly impressed."
5,"I cannot recommend the Grand Hyatt enough. This is our third visit to Bali, our first to NUSA DUA. The Grand Hyatt surpassed all expectations. The staff became friends, the facilities were amazing, the gardens simply magnificent and the rooms ever so comfortable. The pool was to die for. This is a huge hotel with 612 odd rooms and we were told it was 95% full while we were there but seriously, do not know where all these guests were!!! The grounds are so large and magnificent and the pools so stunning and large, that there is room for everyone to find their own quiet space. Our room was so comfortable and we loved just sitting on our veranda watching the ducks in the lagoon or listening to the waves crashing only 50 metres away from our room. Seriously did not want to leave.…"

5,"Hardly about 15 minutes drive from the Airport where we were picked up, we were given a warm welcome and a no frill check in. The property is huge and takes a while to get accustomed , pity we could spend only a couple of days.  Rooms had good view and there was choice of all sorts with a total friendly attitude. Morning walk along the beach side pathway and  to stroll on the beach or have a drink relaxing with the beach view. A treat to  cultural events that gives an incite to the Balinese art and culture added with beautiful presentations. Wonderful experience indeed."
5,"Amazing property and staff !! Ninik at the check-in was wonderful, very professionnal, caring, polite and friendly. We were so well welcomed by the whole staff !! Room had an AMAZING view and the swimming pools are unbelievable... Amazing 3 days we spent!! Thanks to all the teams, you rock guys !!! Definitely will try to come back next year !!"
3,This is a child-friendly resort with a great water slide which was the primary reason why we chose to come back several times.  The kids club was recently renovated and our daughter enjoyed her time there.  The hotel has several restaurants and there are options outside the hotel within walking distance if you prefer some variety.   The resort is rather dated and needs some refreshing with furniture and the overall look.  Service was patchy.  The housekeeper was very friendly and helpful.  But our experience was marred by the duty manager whom we had requested for a late check out as we had a late flight.  She was immediately quarrelsome and rejected our request.  There are other many good hotel options in Bali so we will not be returning to this resort after this unpleasant…
5,"We had a great stay at this hotel last week. Upon checking in, your staff (Singgih) was very friendly and accommodating.  The room was a bit outdated but still very well maintained. My son enjoyed his time at the pool and beach. We had a bit service hiccup when dining at Nampu but the problem was rectified professionally. Overall, we had a great stay at Grand Hyatt Bali and definitely would be coming back here again!"
5,"We had a grand and great family time in this property, beautiful view of the ocean from the Lobby. The hotel offers its own beach which is clean, calm and quiet. Staff is very friendly. Enjoy the evening cultural show"

Service was excellent and timely. Poolside drinks were too expensive and there was no happy hour. Standard of cleanliness around the pool area was disappointing and rooms were not cleaned properly each day. Bedding and towels were replaced daily, but the room lacked freshness and hygiene. The resort is showing its age in certain areas and will need to refurbish again if it is to compete with some of the other 5 star resorts in the Nusa Dua area. I would…"

Resort sits on a huge expanse of land and is distinctly Balinese in design and architecture. Well integrated with nature with lots of well pruned gardens, many ponds teeming with fish and various wildlife that either inhabits or visits the area.

1,"So disappointed , I have been staying with Hyatt for the last 18 years both on family vacations and business. I have been loyal and for this loyalty I have earned a membership level that affords me a few extras when staying at Hyatt properties, such as early check ins and late check outs. This recent trip to bali showed me a different side of Hyatt group. Apparently regardless of my 18 years of loyalty when you book your stay via a travel agent that secures you a good deal , all of those benefits fall away as I wasn't paying full price for me room. I wasn't recognized at all for my loyalty to the group and had a very unpleasant stay at the hotel. Everything we asked for was an effort.

It has great pools, outstanding staff, great restaurants and facilities. The gym was great and the spa centre although expensive was a great experience. We booked through Luxury Escapes and the voucher inclusions were amazing value. Nightly cocktails at the Salse Verde Bar were a must. The only down side was that the sun sets on the other side so we never saw a sun set. The restaurant and massage inclusions were also fantastic. The only downside was the rooms which were only okay.

5,the hotel was one of the best hyatt properties i have ever visited..loved the hotel..would love to visit again ! the best part was the size of the hotel..the morning walk and late night view was truly different from any other place..
2,"After a relaxing holiday in a villa in Semniyak, we were all excited about grand Hyatt, Nusadua. But alas!! It was a roller coaster ride. We arrived at 2pm, just to know that our rooms were not ready yet. After waiting in the lobby for three hours, that is by 5 pm, we were told that though two rooms were ready, the third room would be given at 8 pm!!!!! That too the rooms offered were miles apart, with less than basic amenities. No drawers, crampy n stuffy rooms, n broken telephone.  Next nightmare was the air conditioners in two out of three rooms. They were rundown. Even after repairs they gave way half way through the night. Then was the house keeping !! Apparently there was one man staff, cycling his way around the hotel, and anything you asked for, weather it was water or…"
4,"Very pleasant and personable resort hotel on Nusa Dua beach. Friendly staff, relaxed vibe that also caters for kids with a giant slide, nice food, good breakfasts and a club that is worth joining for the 5-7pm drinks and snacks - ask for a double. It rained the first day and there was nowhere to hire DVDs which surprised us but very minor issue. Overall good value for money from an accom perspective."
4,"There's a lot to like about this place. I've had a pretty good scout around the Nusa Dua beach area, having previously stayed at the Conrad and Marriott hotels, and in my opinion this place has the best location and amenity. It has a wide frontage to the best stretch of Nusa Dua beach with plenty of shade and deck chairs. The magnificent gardens are are credit to the gardening staff and part of what make this a very stunning hotel. The food was ok but the staff were excellent. Rooms were good. I was however very disappointed that a hotel of this calibre isn't taking a more sustainable approach to the provision drinking water for its guests. They only provide plastic bottled water in the rooms and provide no free filtered water at meal times, making guests create even more waste.…"

4,"Very pleasant and personable resort hotel on Nusa Dua beach. Friendly staff, relaxed vibe that also caters for kids with a giant slide, nice food, good breakfasts and a club that is worth joining for the 5-7pm drinks and snacks - ask for a double. It rained the first day and there was nowhere to hire DVDs which surprised us but very minor issue. Overall good value for money from an accom perspective."
4,"There's a lot to like about this place. I've had a pretty good scout around the Nusa Dua beach area, having previously stayed at the Conrad and Marriott hotels, and in my opinion this place has the best location and amenity. It has a wide frontage to the best stretch of Nusa Dua beach with plenty of shade and deck chairs. The magnificent gardens are are credit to the gardening staff and part of what make this a very stunning hotel. The food was ok but the staff were excellent. Rooms were good. I was however very disappointed that a hotel of this calibre isn't taking a more sustainable approach to the provision drinking water for its guests. They only provide plastic bottled water in the rooms and provide no free filtered water at meal times, making guests create even more waste.…"
5,"My wife and I stayed for 8 nights and had wonderful stay , the grounds are outstanding the restaurants were all first class the staff were very helpful and courteous. Great location and is great spot in Nusa Dua close to all local attractions. Highly recommended "
3,The checkin was slow. The room was not well prepared to receive us. Not well cleaned. Tea kettle was not placed in proper place. Refrigerator was not working. We have to instruct the staff to clean the room and keep the things in place. It took our half day out of two day stay. SPa was good. Food was average for vegetarians 
4,"We booked four ocean facing rooms for a family reunion for six nights from 3-9 July. All rooms were lovely and spacious, with large beds and corner sofas against wall. These doubed for beds. Very good for children as couldn't fall out of bed!  The immediate view was over fish ponds and sprawling gardens, with the sea in the distance. As one of my grandchldren is only two, we requested one ground floor room as the baclonies upstairs are not child proof. Young children could easily slip through the wooden railings. Sliding doors leading to the balconies are also easy to open so we were on full alert with the other grandkids too.  The Grand Hyatt at Nusa Dua is a fully equipped resort. You don't need to leave the resort at all as there are numerous restaurants, several swimming…"
5,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua in June 2017 with our 3 boys aged 3,8 and 10. The resort was fantastic for our family with plenty of pools to swim in and an on site waterslide. It also has a beautiful beach directly out the front. We ate a the resort mostly at one of the restaurants' or by the pool. The food was reasonably priced for a resort and great quality. There were always plenty of staff to help and the room was serviced at least once a day. We had a connecting room to our room for the boys which was offered at half the price of a normal room and this definitely made our stay more enjoyable. The hotel offers transport but it is very expensive compared to getting a driver so I would do some research in that area. The hotel is walking distance from the Bali…"
4,"The kids loved the waterslides and the lagoon pool.  We liked the beach.  Gardens were amazing.  Room condition ok.  Gym good and I could go for long runs along the beach (on pavement).  Breakfast good, Salsa verde good, Coffee shop good, Japanese restaurand below standard. Staff very friendly.  Coffee disappointing.  I had to cross the road to a nearby shopping mall to buy myself a cup of coffee. We will  definitely be back very soon!"
5,"Whenever we need to reach for the 'oxygen masks' to recharge ... we head to our beloved Grand Hyatt Bali.  It is such a green and peaceful paradise where we are pampered and soothed by every aspect of it from the legendary Balinese hospitality of kind and caring staff (the Grand Club team are amazing) to the sprawling grounds of gardens and greenery, birdlife and Balinese ponds, to the Spa, direct beach front access and an almost uncountable choice of different pools. Sometimes, alas, we have to take our children however!  And it is every bit as magical for families to share adventures, re-bond and breathe!"

5,This was an amazing trip it was close to other eateries. It had amazing pools even two waterslides. With the pools the waterslides were connected and there were multiple pools that were all connected. There were these cool rocks that you could swim around to get around to the next pool. The restaurants were amazing there was a lobby lounge and again multiple restaurants. The food had clearly been polished and made to perfection and tasted amazing. When we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff and were sat down at a very comfy couch and given cold and refreshing orange juice aswell as a wet towel to cool ourselves off with. The rooms were beyond amazing in our room ( we stayed in the north village) we had a double bed as well as a couchy type of bed that the kids slept on. We…
5,"My husband and I have visited Bali more than 20 times over the years, three times this year alone, staying at different hotels. The Grand Hyatt (GH) at Nusa Dua is located where there is a lot of choice of equally good hotels, all with beachfronts and near a good golf course. It has magnificent sprawling gardens, a few pools, several restaurants, a modern Balinese ambience and excellent service. We stayed in a newer suite that was spacious & modern with beautiful decor and view.  We would rate their suites and service as amongst the best. The Grand Hyatt is probably the overall best hotel at Nusa Dua but some rooms seemed to be in an older condition than others. Buffet breakfasts were excellent.  The nightly Balinese food buffet and cultural performance are a must and great…"
5,"It is a big resort on the beautiful beach. The rooms are big and warmly decorated. it might be too much walking get around the hotel for some people. I consider it a bonus. There are gardens of different themes, lily pond, little bridge, stone paved road in the green and the mile long beach facing the blue ocean. Walking on the property is a pleasure.      The food is very good in the restaurant. The room service was quick. The house keeping was very responsive on request. All the staff we encountered are courteous. A very pleasant 2day stay."
4,Great service! Staff were excellent in this very nice 5 star Hotel. Great beachfront location in quiet location away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta and Seminyak. 25 year old hotel has had a great renovation. The highlight for me was the beautiful mature trees and gardens. we sniffed out some secluded swimming pools and lazed around. Breakfast buffets featuring fantastic omlettes were a highlight although coffee service was slow. Staff were wonderful-polite and welcoming.
5,"Grand Hyatt Bali is magical. The gardens are amazing, everything is so clean and the staff are so warm and helpful. We had a great time in Bali it is right on the beach with lots of pools and the japanese teppanyaki night was fantastic, Garden Cafe has wonderful breakfasts."

5,"I have been here at the Grand Hyatt Bali for nearly a week now. It has been really wonderful, the staff, accommodation, grounds have all been great. The attention to details has been excellent. Considering the size of the hotel, the gardens are beautiful and well maintained, not a blade of grass left to grow too long.   We booked Club which is well worth it, not only do you have a dedicated reception but breakfast in the club lounge and drinks in the evening in the club have been delicious and plentiful. And as for the food... too much! 😋  I would not hesitate to recommend this Hotel and having stayed in other Grand Hyatt Hotels, it definitely meets their standards! "
4,"I'm really enjoying the hotel. It's very big and there are heaps of facilities. The fitness centre is amazing and has great equipment and even a seperate pool, spa, steam room and sauna. The main two pools are really great and the location is great being right next to the Bali connection shopping centre. However the rooms are very disappointing. I find them to be very noisy and find it hard to do any work. There is lots of noise from other tourists and music. I think the higher up you stay the less noisy it will be. The channel selection is really good and most channels are HD but there is no DVD player in the room and no USB input for movies. Breakfast is ok, not the best I have had but not the worst. Overall I'd recommend staying here even if it is an older place"
5,"We stayed for 7 nights @Grand Hyatt Bali. The rooms are big with huge bed, quite clean but not 5 stars, superb pools, very nice beach with sunbeds under the trees.  We had a very nice vacation here, staff polite and kind. Breakfast food is diversified and good, but very crowded and we had to wait to find an empty table. Restaurants inside are very expensive but quality/price ratio is very low. Much better and quite cheaper restaurants can be found nearby (100m) in Bali Collection. Overall, a very nice experience, but food quality/price ratio."
5,"Hyatt always be our family favorite hotel. We love everything's from pool, garden, and clean beach. The staff are very helpful, kind, and full of smile. We love to spend the day at the beach, the have a lots to be play with from surf board, kayaking, paddle boarding, etc... "
3,"Having received good feedback from friends and family who previously stayed at the hotel over 10 years ago, we decided to stay there. Unfortunately the hotel doesn't seem to have moved on much from that period and is rather outdated, especially the rooms, including some crumbling paintwork and tired woodwork.   That being said the gardens are beautiful and well maintained and the location is great next to Bali collections.  However the service was very poor in almost all areas. It took over an hour for our luggage to come to our room, getting a drink by the pool took about 30 mins (if you can flag someone down) or by the beach almost impossible (I was asked probably once in around 6 hours each time).  The breakfast is also very poor and almost exactly the same everyday. The…"

5,"Cannot fault this superb resort. Hysterically happy kids swimming in divine pools and huge well supervised waterslide. Rooms superb and almost all look over lakes and pools. 50 acres of superb creative gardens with typical Balinese quirky statues etc in abundance. Beach area gorgeous white clean smooth sand and sea invitingly swim able when tide in.  AND v upmarket shopping village centre over the road with department store, supermarket, surf shops, massages and eateries. Grand Hyatt staff so friendly and helpful it's sad to leave. Lots of folk on Luxury Escape vouchers which means a wonderful busy happy atmosphere in a serene place."
3,Still a great hotel but getting tired.  We were on a Luxury escapes package and overall had a wonderful time but felt it had come down in quality from our stay 2 years ago. Gardens and back are great although the amount of plastic pollution on the north end of the beach is not a positive.
5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali is one of the most luxurious hotels we've ever visited, absolutely perfect for familes or coules looking to relax in five-star style. A visit to the Kriya Spa is a must, and having the Bali Collection shopping precinct right across the street is great."
5,"We got a great deal through Luxury escapes, we didn't think we would get much for the money we paid ...... HOW wrong could we have been,   Hotel is ""OUTSTANDING""   We had a few issues at first wth the AC but it got fixed so no worries   Staff and Food were both Excellent could not fault any   Yes the bar prices are expensive but when your in a resort you should expect to pay high prices,   If it's cheap food your after go to Bali Collection across the road !!!! But all the restaurants are owned by one company,  Bali Dinner and show night is highly recommended.   Good Job Grand Hyatt Bali   "
5,"An excellent resort with beautiful gardens, pool, great restaurants etc. the staff were very helpful and attentive. Our family of four really had a great time and really did not feel the need to leave the hotel. The beach was by far the best we have experienced in Bali. Our room was great, and a good size with the kids using the day bed for sleeping. We would come here again. Highly recommended. "

5,"Beautiful hotel with excellent service, amenities, and location.  Would highly recommend.  Bali Collection was across the road provided options and shopping.  But food inside the hotel was also very good.  The staff was as friendly and efficient as any of the SE Asia hotels we've been to.  We rode our bikes through a couple of neighbouring hotels and Grand Hyatt was comfortably the nicest.   Would happily go back there."
3,The staff were very helpful the hotel is a bit dated the room we were allocated had smell of dampness the staff did try to freshen this up but to no avail no other rooms as hotel was full.  Food is overpriced and lack of selection we ended up walking down to Bali Collection good choice of restaurants excellent food at fraction of the price. Best restaurant in Bali Collection for food service and friendly atmosphere Bebek Tapi Sawah try the duck it is a must
4,"Extensive gardens and weary beautiful beach area, very expensive food and drinks which was a shame as it was a lovely environment. Breakfast staff fantastic but not enough staff to handle the area, they were run off their feet."
1,"Our family is staying in Nusa Dua in Bali so thought we would go to the Grand Hyatt for a cocktail at sunset and have dinner in the Italian restaurant below. Having stayed in Bali  previously with girlfriends and our kids, I had fond memories of doing this.  Didn't work out at all. How a hotel manages to do a bad Mojito is beyond me but that is where it started.  The bruschetta bread was soggy, the kids' fish had bones through it, the kids' chicken was burnt, the two steaks weren't cooked as requested and was so tough that you could barely cut it, the rice in the risotto was way undercooked and crunchy, and the seafood used in the different dishes was bland and small.  I have never felt compelled to write a negative review but when an experience like that costs around $250 and…"

5,There a very few places on this planet that offers such good value for money. The geography of the area: beautiful beach and surrounding gardens are complemented by clean and pristine swimming pools. Easy access to the airport.
4,"Grand Hyatt Bali is huge resort hotel with beautiful garden setting. Since it is a big hotel, therefore hotel guests are coming in coaches!! As such, if you are looking for some quiet & peaceful holiday, this place may not be that ideal...  The room is dated, but we do appreciate the daybed included on top of the king bed in the room, as my kid enjoy occupying the daybed himself, and we requested the housekeeping set up the daybed at night so that my son can sleep there as well.   However, being too comfortable at the daybed, my son has left his Casio G-shock at one corner of the daybed, without realizing until we checked out and left the hotel premises. When I called back 7 plus in the evening, I was told nothing is found during the room cleaning!  While we truly understand…"

5,"Thank you too all the friendly staff and for the effort that is put into making it look and feel like a true paradise!!! Pricing for goods purchased in the resort and Nusa Dua as a whole is aimed at tourists BUT a short walk away, great bargains awaits..... 😜"

4,"I lived in building #4 which is only few minutes walk to the Bali Collection.  Very convenient to access restaurants, shops and SPAs.  The room is spacious and comfortable but the decoration is a little bit old.  There is great view from the swimming pool and the beach.  High quality food is provided in the restaurants inside the hotel."
5,"Great resort that caters for family escapes, including relaxation for parents. The waterslide was a BIG hit with the kids (aged 7, 9 and 11) as well as the surrounding rock walled pools/swimming area. Dining options are also very suitable for travelling with children. We had interconnecting rooms which were spacious and well laid out; separate shower to the bath as well as a separate 'wardrobe' area made our stay very comfortable. Very close to the Luxury Collection (just across the road) and a short stroll to other child friendly activities such as a Pirates Bay and Surf and Turf. Staff always greet you in passing and we're very friendly and accommodating. From an adult perspective, the resort Kriya Spa is beautiful and located in a quiet corner of the resort. In summary, from…"
3,"A day trip to Nusa Dua saw us walking the trail by the beach & needing sustenance, stopped at the pool bar for a light lunch & a few drinks. The service was excellent although it took a long time for the food to arrive after placing our order. We actually loved just relaxing by the pool with a few, guess what, Bintangs of course. Two plates of food – 1 fish & chips & the 2nd calamari & chips – one would have done for us both. The calamari was very tough, some pieces being inedible & we left most on the plate. But the fish was exceptional & all the chips were quite good. Prices were high compared to most places on Bali. We have been on the island for several weeks in different venues & both felt that this Nusa Dua area was really not Bali at all – just huge hotels catering to…"

Very close to the Luxury Collection (just across the road) and a short stroll to other child friendly activities such as a Pirates Bay and Surf and Turf. Staff always greet you in passing and we're very friendly and accommodating. From an adult perspective, the resort Kriya Spa is beautiful and located in a quiet corner of the resort. In summary, from…"
3,"A day trip to Nusa Dua saw us walking the trail by the beach & needing sustenance, stopped at the pool bar for a light lunch & a few drinks. The service was excellent although it took a long time for the food to arrive after placing our order. We actually loved just relaxing by the pool with a few, guess what, Bintangs of course. Two plates of food – 1 fish & chips & the 2nd calamari & chips – one would have done for us both. The calamari was very tough, some pieces being inedible & we left most on the plate. But the fish was exceptional & all the chips were quite good. Prices were high compared to most places on Bali. We have been on the island for several weeks in different venues & both felt that this Nusa Dua area was really not Bali at all – just huge hotels catering to…"
4,"I really enjoy stay at Hyatt Hotel... the room is so good.. big spaces.. beach and the swimming pool... i just regret not spend more night at Grand Hyatt... i only have one issue , they rejected my late check out due the occupancy.. but the duty manager helped me out for this matter.. so everythings fine... i'm surely will comeback and stay at  Grand Hyatt  Hotel.."
4,Visit this hotel second time with 2 years between and very please to say that I am not disappointed. I get everything I expected and probably will come back in future if I get similar deal. Used Luxury Escapes.
5,"Stayed 8 nights through a Luxury Escapes offer. Was great value. The hotel has been there a long time but has a wonderful atmosphere and charm. Very quite and relaxing. Only downside was the Japanese restaurant, food not what I expected.  Would definitely go there again. "
5,"Beautiful hotel set in fabulous gardens, lovely swimming pools with plentiful sun beds, clean spacious rooms, although some a little 'tired'. Friendly staff great service, however breakfast can be a bit hectic if you go at a busy time. The reception area must have the best view of any hotel anywhere, it's breathtaking, must be seen! Lovely spa, fab treatments , a bit pricey but look out for the deals......massage well worth having, heavenly."
4,Our family of 4 stayed in 2 double rooms that were interconnecting. Second room was half price. They are traditional Balinese style rooms built in the 90's. Not much wardrobe space but they both had large daybeds indoors that were the size of double beds. Plenty of bottled water everyday. The restaurants are good but very standard for Nusa Dua styled cuisines. The Bali Collection in only a few hundred meters away. The Kriya Spa was the nicest spa I've seen and the massages were some of the best in the world. We came when the lantern festival was on and it is only a 10 min walk out of the hotel.  Well worth the AUD $7.50 entry. The pools are nice but have heaps of plastic daybeds which reminds me of Gold Coast style family appartments resorts. There are also no tunes whatsoever…

5,"2nd stay here and again a lovely resort. Last time was with kids/grandkids, this time as a couple. It works for all ages. Such a great ""built environment"" - beautiful buildings and stunning landscapes/gardens. Wonderful staff, great facilities, good restaurants, etc."
3,"Rooms full of mosquitos even though all doors and windows were closed. I got 12 bites in one night - lucky I only stayed one night. The rooms are noisy. Not between rooms but as people walk past they are loud and every sound comes through the front door.  The service in restaurants is SOOOOO slow. Even when nobody is there and there are staff clearly around. You have to keep asking for service. I know it's Bali and you expect everything to be a little slower on Bali time, but not at a resort like this when you are paying top dollar to be there. Staff are really nice and I felt safe the whole time.  Would I stay again? I'd probably pick somewhere else for that price.   Nusa Dua is in itself quite fabricated as everything has been made for the higher end tourist- you stay in a…"
4,"Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua is one of the older resorts at Nusa Dua, but love the overall size of the resort (set on 17 hectares) main pool is huge, many lotus flower lagoons with many wildlife;  beach area is beautiful and large. Excellent and easy walk to The Bay area and in the other direction almost 'forever'. Very close to Bali Collection with its upmarket shops and variety of restaurants. Resort has a large variety of 'pricey' shops on site; craft market each evening, good choice of restaurants. Rooms showing their age but large, clean and well kept. The onsite spa was a bit disappointing - massage staff we encountered didn't seem very well trained, neither did the manicure and pedicure girls. Would stay there again for a relaxing holiday in very pleasant surroundings.  Tropiglo"
5,A really enjoyabale and relaxing  holiday experience and most likley to go back again with my family again in the future  we had a lovely room and all matters we needed were taken care of without any fuss or issues.
4,"After spending 10 nights at the Hyatt through a Luxury Escape package it was I think money well spent!! King bed room, 10 cocktails each,buffet breakfast each day, 3 dinners and 1 lunch plus a full massage for 2 and transfer to and from the airport was a very good package. I think it came to around $500 to $600 worth of thrown ins!!. The resort its self was huge. The ground staff make sure this is in tip top condition and well done. All restaurants within the resort are very good and well worth a try, breakfast on the other hand I think more selection is needed!! All the pool areas - 3 in total are just so good. Also the beach is within meters of the hotel which is also very clean. All staff members are very polite and friendly so well done. The rooms are big and also the…"

1,"Been vacationing in resorts around the world for the past 20 years, and by far this was my worst experience.   Hotel is aged, plastic sunbeds are in bad shape, pool service staff is not catching up with the requests, wifi is extremely slow...   But these are the least of their problems..  You are paying over a hundred dollars for a night to a name resort... And that resort is selling $15 day passes to huge Chinese groups, who take over the pool, over-crowd the area, take photos everywhere, and make a lot of noise. And since there isn't much control of who walks in around the resort, your personal belongings are under risk as well..  I'd avoid Grand Hyatt in Bali, there are many other resorts in the area, and we had much better experience in another resort next door just previous…"
5,Great stay.  Beautiful gardens and pools. Food excellent with reasonable variation of menus.  Poolside service attentive and friendly. Staff very friendly and helpful. Plenty of shade available and comfortable loungers without having to reserve places.
4,Highly recommend. We have two kids under two and there was plenty to do. Kids pools excellent. Kids play equipment on the beach also great.  We got a nanny to help out and she was like a member of the family. Easy stroll to shops at the end of the street. Lots of excellent restaurants in Nusa Dua. 
5,"Great place for a Bali Holiday, beautiful grounds, a number of different pool areas and on the beach for a swim. Great restaurants with different food options, nice rooftop bar for that evening cocktail. Bali Collection five minute walk away for heaps more food options and shopping"
5,"My wife and I have just returned after spending 7 lovely days and nights at this excellent resort. Where to begin?  Breakfast options - great array of fruits and cereals. Eggs cooked cheerfully anyway you like and very attentive staff meeting all our needs. Grazing between courses while talking reading and enjoying the pool and ocean views, was not a problem.   I had a burger and it was exactly that; a burger with fries. Went next door to Bali collection and while all prices are cheaper the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" applies. Quality is ok but quantity is limited.  Hotel room was delightful with full ensuite bath and walk in robe. Lovely balcony looking into a pond complete with ducks and fish. Watched the sun go down each evening no flies no mozzies.  Pool area caters…"

1,"Returned here as found previously stay relaxing and enjoyable. However, this time wanted to book a spa package. Website states : With our Spa Package, you'll enjoy: Full Breakfast $100 Credit for Kriya Spa Late Checkout Until 4:00pm   Was only told when booking the package that I wouldn't be eligible for any of these due to booking with Expedia. The page does not state this anywhere and the staff/spa staff did not have a clue about this 'offer' so was probably just trying to be fobbed off. Actually booked a later flight with this in mind upon booking. Feeling conned."
4,My husband and I stayed for our honeymoon in June - it was the last stop as we previously stayed in Ubud and Gili T - we stayed 5 nights here.   We had booked the grand club lounge - which was really good with free soft drinks all day and food between 5 - 7. The people there were lovely! So helpful and friendly. My only niggle is that when booking in they stated you get cocktails 5 - 7 - however when we asked it was just wines and spirits - not cocktails. There is also a club lounge pool so you would think you can get the free soft drinks through out the day there but unfortunately you have to go to the club lounge every time you want a drink and can't bring these to the room/pool.   We found the hotel very expensive so ate mostly at the Bali collection directly opposite which…
1,"The property limits the room temperature to 23 C. The system allows you to choose 17 C as the lowest setting, but the property does not allow you to modify to a lower temperature setting. Room was very hot and uncomfortable. Management could care less. "
4,"The location of this Hotel is unbeatable. It is a huge property...extremely well maintained. The staff is ever smiling, even if unhelpful. The Grand Hyatt is expensive compared to other properties in it's proximity."
4,"We stayed in the grand Hyatt Bali for the end of may beginning of June 2017. We arrived at Bali airport at approx 10pm we arranged for a transfer to the hotel in arrivals at a cost of 400000rupiah (don't do this as you can get a blue bird taxi on the meter for less then 100000). We had an approx 30 min transfer to the hotel where we were taken to check in. When we were checking in we were asked for our credit card to secure any food and drink that we wanted to charge for our room, we explained that we don't have a credit card and that we only use debit card or cash and we explained that we had no intention to charge anything to our room, at this point they demanded 5 million rupiah off us to cover any purchases, I explained again that I wouldn't be charging anything to the room…"

The rooms are spacious and modern , while retaining the Balinese touch. Have always enjoyed the true Balinese hospitality at the Grand Hyatt Bali."

The food and beverages of high standard and best of all the staff are very friendly, responsive and accommodating.  I shall return as soon as I am able to."
3,"There are some mixed feelings about this one. Definitely some good stuff to mention. The Food - so delicious wherever you go. We tried Pasar Senggol with cultural experience, Salsa Verde and Garden Cafe. The Internet coverage throughout property was satisfying; you would find some blind spots here and there but overall I think it was even better than expected. The Garden -magnificent and very well maintained. Kriya Spa - experience and environment are WOW, you'd truly enjoy that, of course comes with the premium price. Trio Batak - the band which will make your evenings memorable. Beach - clean and beautiful. People - above all very polite and welcoming with smiles on their faces. You can tell that they are the main asset of this resort. Our special compliment to Sria from…"
5,"Great place to have a family holiday. About 30 mins and $12 taxi fair from shopping in Legian. Expensive to eat at the resort but lots of options near by. Staff are very friendly, especially Wayan Sudasana at the pool. Visit waterbom park is a must!"
5,"We had a wonderful 10 day stay at the Hyatt, the beautiful spotless beach, the great blue swimming pools and the wonderful grounds that look like Eden. The Staff are fantastic and nothing is a bother. We will definitely be back. A great hotel."

A must visit, if you are looking at a destination to completely wind down! "
1,"This was our second stay at GHB.   First time was ok and we thought let's give it another go and so we booked/ paid for 12 days. We booked an upgraded room with a day bed to accommodate for a 2 year old child.  Big mistake.   When we checked in, ""the only room available"" was a run down room at the end of south wing.  Room would've been suitable for backpackers that can't get a 2star hotel in Kuta and have $30 to spend per night. We paid full listed price.  Anyway, this is what we got.  Room 3140:  1. Leaking shower and taps that squirted water all over the bathroom.  2. There was mould around the bath and basin.  3. Ceiling must've sustained water damage from a room above and was never really fixed.  4. Furniture predated WW1 and an ancient TV set was smaller then an iPad…"
4,Excellent Hotel and stunning gardens. The rooms could do with some decor updating. The size of the room was good and the day bed was lovely. The  emerald pool was just gorgeous and perfect to relax and paddle. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. The Spa was sensational.
5,"Excellent 5 star hotel, with amenities too numerous to mention.    Service fantastic, food offerings varied and tasty if a bit overpriced for Indonesia.  The main pool is a bit crowded, but the Balinese pool is an oasis."
4,"Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua was great for us - a family of 4; we stayed here for 3 nights with an ocean view that was just amazing and refreshing. We had booked a single room with 2 beds (1 king sized bed & an extra bed for the kids) that was quite sufficient for the 2 adults and the boys aged 14 and 11. The property is decent sized with a lazy river pool and a Balinese pool that are safe for swimming. We were able to spot a water monitor lizard, also known as an ""Alu"" locally inside the property. The service was good. We just had an observation - the fruits and cookies that were present on the 1st day that we checked in were never replenished during our stay of 3 nights and 4 days. The complimentary breakfast had a wide selection. Definitely would recommend Grand Hyatt for a good…"

They offer you a very refreshing welcome drink as well as some wet towels when checking in.And very helpful staff. We had breakfast included in the package which was 80% non veg but since we were veg we requested the chef for some veg options which was made very well. Overall an amazing trip and experience at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua,Bali"
5,First time in Bali stayed at Hyatt and couldn't ask for better hotel and deal.  The hotel/resort was very secure and all round a pleasure to be at. Did some tours which we found good but was always good to get back where we called home. We will do again without a doubt 👍
5,"Stayed at this fabulous hotel for 9 nights in club sea view.. Outstanding grounds which will take your breath away. But most of all it's the staff which makes this place one of the best, always there with a smile & ready to assist.  Would like to say a big thank you to Adi, Urip, Ary Suaryanthi, Mary, all club reception & catering staff, you all made our stay a memorable one & hopefully we shall all return in the near future. Thank you all."
5,"Highly recommend for a luxurious and friendly break. A very beautiful resort, lovely staff, helpful to a disabled friend. Love it. No need to leave the Hyatt, as restaurants, shopping swimming all available. I recommend the Krya Spa. Bliss."
5,We used accumulated Hyatt Hotel points for this trip and they were well spent!  We are booked for three more nights at the end of July since we enjoyed it so much...  The wait staff were so wonderfully kind and attentive.  Great location👍😎

5,"We spent 8 nights on the Luxury Escape package from 1st June 2017. We upgraded to the Club which was fabulous. We enjoyed everything the Grand Hyatt offered. The wildlife at the resort was our daughters favourite. She could not wait to get to breakfast every morning to see the birds, fish and Monitors. Truely a highlight of her stay.  The service by all staff members was excellent but I have to mention a few staff members who made us feel very welcome. Starting from the check in desk in the club area, Adi, Merry, Wiji, Yunik, Sri and Saputra. Then at the club lounge, Sutrisna, Putri, Norman. Then the fitness club, Ashlay - Yoga Trainer . Adi in reservations, even though we never met, he was very helpful in assisting with pricing and location with regards to the Club benefits and…"
5,"My wife and I, along with daughter, son-in-law and two small children spent 8 nights here on a Luxury Escapes package. The deal delivered everything promised and we were not made to feel cheapskates in any way by the staff. The hotel itself is very large, numerous buildings throughout the beautiful gardens, it's on the beachfront and across the road from Bali Collection, a large mall containing restaurants and many other shops. The Hyatt staff are obviously well trained but are also genuinely warm and friendly, whether it be gardeners, maintenance people, waitstaff or management. We ate breakfast in the Garden Restaurant each day and it was well presented and slightly varied and catered for Western and Eastern tastes. We ate some dinners at the Salsa Verde restaurant near the…"
5,"We've stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali, and every visit is a joy. The friendly and attentive staff help us make the most of the great location. the beach, pools and health club provide an excellent balance for activity and relaxation. "
5,"We stayed at home this resort. The staff were fabulous and every single one was friendly, smiling, helpful and made us feel really quite special. The resort is beautiful with extensive stunning gardens and an impressive variety of pools. We loved being able to sit by the pool, under a tree and read after swimming.  The beach is excellent too and it was good to be able to sit there and order a drink! We highly recommend you take advice from the hotel and do a day tour - these were highlights for us. "
4,"The grounds of the hotels are huge and beautifully maintained. The hotel is spread out well, allowing a feeling of privacy. The food at all the restaurants we tried, was great. The beach area was well maintained and there a a number of pools available."

5,"We stayed at this Hotel for two nights in Club room. The resort satisfied his name  ie the grand. From check in to check out everything was grand. Particularly landscaping of this resort ultra grand. Even to visit whole property you have to spare whole day. No more to say, highly satisfied with service and it was worth to stay here."
5,Beautiful luxury hotel! The have 5 or 6 pools with slides and a private beach! Also 4 restaurants. Simply stunning! Rooms are quite big and comfortable! Hotel is huge so there is a lot of walk required inside the property!
5,"The most amazing holiday experience for a relaxing holiday situated on the sands of Nusa Dua. Many restaurant options on site with the beautiful pool system surrounded lots of shady trees but also a large sandy cove for ocean swimming. The staff at this property are extremely friendly, attentive and genuinely helpful and lovely. We loved this property and will return because it was a beautiful Bali experience."
5,"My wife and I stayed for 8 nights.  Since the arrival it really puts a great effort into mark your experience! Felt like it was our wedding day and we were the centre of attention!   True hospitality that you can feel the proud of the workers when they great you, when they try to assist, and of happy they are to have you there!  The food was just outstanding! The variety at the Pasar Sengol and the quality of Salsa Verde really challenges any 5 stars restaurant to improve!  From a colleague, really well done! I'm taking with me to London a bit of what I have learnt with this stay!"
4,"All staff were very friendly, grounds and resort were amazing and beautiful. Walls seemed paper thin though as we could hear the coming and going of people and staff. Room while clean and nice could do with a lick of paint and would be great."

4,"When you put two rock-hard single beds together, that's not a king bed. You might call it a ""hollywood king"" but that's just two rock-hard single beds clumsily stuck together.  I know it's convenient for the hotel to be able to change a twin room into a king room by just sticking the twin beds together, but really uncomfortable for the guests. It's something a 5-star hotel shouldn't do.  In fairness, the hotel changed the bed when I complained about it but I have since read plenty of reviews on the same issue at this hotel dating back to 2009.  Otherwise we had a really enjoyable stay. Staff were great, restaurants had very good food and the hotel grounds were amazing."
5,We recently spent 8 nights at the beautiful Grand Hyatt @ Nusa Dua. We enjoyed every moment of our stay. All the facilities were excellent and the staff were extremely helpful and attentive. I would highly recommend this resort!
5,Wonderful hotel and company. We had to cancel our booking due to family illness but the hotel were great and accommodated our changed  booking   even giving us a time span of many months.Most impressive. Another hotel gave us a three week time limit.
4,"We had a good time in Grand Hyatt. The buffet dinner and cultural show is great. The Salsa Restaurant and it's band is a good place to spend an evening. The room is big and staff is friendly. It is almost perfect if (1) allow 30 min of wifi after check out. We cant reach our tour guide for airport pick up after we check out from the hotel and it caused us to miss the pick up. (2) the taxi stand should make a laudspeaker announcement in the visitor parking area to check whether our guide is there, (3) breakfast buffet is having almost the same dishes everyday. Although the food is good, the choice is quiet limited and it is a little boring after 3 days.. overall, good experience.  If the WiFi works after check out, will be perfect.   "
5,"If you are looking for relaxing tranquil vacation this ticks all the boxes. We upgraded to Club. Well worth it. Rooms with lovely views each time. But the staff are unbelievable wonderful. Nothing is too much trouble. From reception to chef, kitchen, waiters & waitress "

4,This is a good hotel with great service and amazing beachfront. Rooms could be improved as feel a bit dated. Otherwise a very great place with friendly staff and lush beautiful landscapes with some good restaurants.
5,"We spent 10 days at the resort and had a very enjoyable experience. In addition to the high quality standard of the facility with its magnificent gardens, we were overwhelmed by the warm and caring attitude of the staff who went out of their way to make our stay very special. Would definitely go back and recommend."
5,"The ambience, friendly staff, food, pool areas, beaches and beautiful gardens are in the old Bali style and make it the best in Bali. It's position close to the Collections Shopping & Restaurants is a big positive. There is no need to leave the area. We Weill be back there soon"
5,"My Girlfriend and I stayed here after much deliberation, at first we were both slightly worried about the size of the hotel due to us previously being on quite private holidays. However, these worries were found to be nonsense as we found that the whole stay (2 and a half weeks) was very personal and all the staff very friendly and welcoming.   We were upgraded to an Ocean View room Which was spacious and offered all of the required facilities.  The Hotel itself was very clean and all of the pools were equally impressive and clean.  The only downside we found was the location in regards to food outside the hotel. When we go on holiday we like to try different cuisines but found we were only offered European food in the Bali Collection which is not to our tastes personally. …"
5,Well grand hyatt bali is a amazing 5 star property boasting of lush green surroundings of almost 10 acres area I guess . The beach has clear waters and soft powdery sand. It Has so many pools all around the resort both for kids and elders. Jacuzzis at the back side of pool is amazing as well.  Resort is huge and has msny restraunts inside serving different kinds of cuisine . The shops have a stunning architecture as well ..the whole resort has a Indonesian feel . One cannot help but notice how maticulously the lay out of whole resort is done to perfection . The jiva spa of the resort is another world in the beautiful resort ! Not to forget how warm are the staff  of the resort ! We were throughly delighted !

3,"I stayed in Hyatt for 1 night, in Grand King Club room. (my friend stayed earlier for some IT company conference for couple nights). They have big garden with private access to beautiful white sand Nusa Dua beach. The first day is quite OK, we had good time on the beach, and there's some music jam in the bar on sunset time. We had little not comfortable issues the day after, we had breakfast, mentioned our room to the staff, the staff didn't mentioned to us before that breakfast is not included in our price (my friend used that kind a point system to pay the hotel), so we just sat, and started our breakfast (ps : the staff also said that they have fresh juice, buy we assume it's only can juice, CMIIW). Then after we had breakfast, she came with the bill saying that the breakfast…"
3,"Most of the staff do not speak clearly in English. Oftentimes, misunderstanding, and wrong directions are given because of this language barrier. Good thing is it is near the Bali Collection(market, shops, and food stalls)"
4,"Hotel is very consistent with service, etc. Room are nice and I was situated near the beach and one of their pools. Only issue was that the air conditioning did not work well at all and my room was consistently too warm. Kept me from sleeping well."
4,"My wife and I stayed at Grand Hyatt Bali during our 4-day vacation.  We came with full expectation as Grand Hyatt being a well-known brand for quality.  In fact when our tour agent gave us an option of another 5-star hotel in Nusa Dua, we insisted on Grand Hyatt.  I wonder if we made a right choice.  We arrived at night and everything looked so nice.  We were greeted by friendly staff at the reception and were served drinks.  I noted that it was a cordial drink, not really fruit juice.  We were upgraded to honeymoon room.  The room was quite big but it looked dated.  Not like other Grand Hyatt room I imagined.  Even the toiletteries looked cheapish.  The whole complex is very grand though.  The landscaping is outstanding.  You can do a lot of activities without leaving the…"

5,This was my third visit to Bali and my second to the Grand Hyatt - the previous having been for a wedding. The Grand Hyatt occupies a prime location on pristine Nusa Dua beach. Upon arrival my friends and I where whisked directly to our beach front rooms where the check-in was completed. The room had expansive beach and lake views and was located close to the Grand Club. Since we came by rental car the helpful staff valet parked our vehicle and had it quickly on hand when called for. The staff were genuinely friendly and the evening of our arrival - due to our late arrival time all restaurants had already closed. Since we're still hungry the food and beverage manager came to see us at Salsa Verse Bar where she took our order which was delivered within 20 minutes to our rooms.…
5,"Awesome hotel, Looked after our family of 7 extremely well. Very friendly staff. Amazing hotel. Can't fault anything. Pools, Slide, Restaurants, Rooms everything was 100%!! You can't go wrong with staying at the Grand Hyatt at Nusa Dua."
5,Sorry to leave after 8 highly enjoyable days with superb attentive and friendly staff. We were actually fare-welled by many staff at a number of venues. Great setting and privacy when wanted. Great to see the antics of squirrels and ducks which made time fly when on our private balcony overlooking one of the many tropical ponds.
5,I would say this hotel is just superb.... My stay was fabulous..  The hotel area is vast.. You get everything you ask for a five star to be like.. What a gigantic pool... and a lovely and grand private beach.. Just superb... Hotel staff were very courteous... Special accolades to Mulya the Garden cafe manager who not only asked about our comfortable stay but also gave us tips for the daily tours which we made...... Kriya Spa... though i didn't venture out it.. But would surely love to get in the next time...  The rooms were neat and tidy... Just had small problem with the Air conditioning which was fixed in just half hour.... Overall a value for money experience....
4,"Very nice property with beautiful manicured grounds. A lot of effort goes into maintaining the landscaped gardens, with certain areas by the pool resembling rice fields (nice touch). Great attention to details in that area.  Very large property. Nice swimming pool with a slide. It doesn't feel crowded. Service in all areas is good and all staff are super friendly and welcoming.   We dined at garden cafe and the menu is good and dishes are tasty.  We enjoyed dinner at Pasar Sengol (see separate review) and this was the best dining experience we had in Bali.   Breakfast by the pool was really pleasant. Great facilities in the Bay club. (Which is available to freshen up before checkin or after checkout).   A few drawbacks however, the rooms although spacious feel a bit old and…"

The grounds & gardens magnificent, as are all the pools, in particular the winding lagoon pool, the best ever. Two of our party were sick with a virus, the hotel sent two beautiful flower arrangements to each room, now where would you get that???? They also asked after the sick ones, saying just to call if we needed a doctor. The only downside was it was extremely noisy around our room, other guests with no respect for any one else. Our room was overlooking the secret emerald pool, now that was a great pool also & close to our room. Breakfasts fantastic, Japanese restaurant excellent, not so good at Salsa Verde this time, with set menu for the Luxury Escape guests. Good food…"
5,"Ground floor room, near beach. Room very comfortable. A/c. Roomy bathroom. Excellent breakfasts in a choice of locations - our favourite was the open air restaurant nearest to the ocean. Dinners were very, very good. Staff obliging. Great location. Did not need to go anywhere else except to buy cheaper beer."
1,Our experience here was terrible and it is not worth the price that we paid per night! It was dirty and the AC didn't work and the staff was not attentive to our issues. Nice pool though and pool bar servers were great!
5,"This sprawling estate offers a maze of Balinese wonderland with swimming pools, beaches, bars and restaurants scattered along a pristine slip of Bali coastline. The rooms are all very well appointed and the sports equipment and facilities offered something for everyone. The luxurious poolside service made us feel like royalty and the local position allowed us to explore the island with ease and return to the sanctuary of our air conditioned rooms with tired smiles on our faces and an enriched travel experience."
5,"Had wonderful time at this "" very grand""  Hotel.We had an upgrade to a lagoon view room which was great on the ground floor, quite private, and steps away from the lagoon and beach in the background. The hotel staff and everyone we dealt with at this resort were outstanding, so helpful & attentive to our needs and just lovely to us."

5,"Like a typical Grand Hyatt chain, this hotel offers nothing than the best. My room was very spacious that can actually fit 4 adult!  The landscape of the hotel is flat, typicall of those in Nusa Dua BTDC. It is arguably the oldest and the largest hotel in the area.  Normally, Head of States, Presidents, PMs - they will either stay in Hyatt or Four Season. The security and protocol basically upto VBIP standard.  I stayed in 2xxx room whereby designated as a slightly higher than standard room. My only complaint is this hotel WAY too big and a lot of stairs. Might be challenging (still possible) for those in wheelchair. "
2,"The hotel is nearly a quater of a century old and the rooms definitely need to revamp.  Sadly the room was infested with small insects like tiny ants and others. It was surprising to see so many insects in the room on the fourth floor.  Previous guests must have complained but nothing done?  Also molds were noticeable in the shower room.  AC worked on and off.   Grand Club was nice with friendly staff, but the service quality was not as good as other Hyatt Regency Clubs.  Less choices were availabe for food and drinks.  Also there were no newspapers to read.  Considering the price Hyatt is charging, we found overall quality of the hotel was rather poor.  You may find a better and newer hotel at lower price elsewhere."
4,"The resort was picture perfect. Highlights were the beautiful property, the room the pool, the salsa bar and the friendly people. Had a great stay ! For a vegetarian the food options were limited and it would be great if that can be improved."
5,"Just home from a fabulous holiday in the Grand Hyatt at Nusa Dua. The hotel grounds are vast & beautiful, the beach pristine, food was fresh, tasty & in ample supply, rooms were very clean & comfortable and the service from every staff member that we met was exceptional; nothing was too much trouble, even giving us the recipe for the moreish sambal that we devoured each night in the Grand Club lounge!  Can't wait to go back there again!"
3,"Stayed couple of years ago and was expecting the same this year, but the things have changed.  The only thing that is still the same is the amazing staff.  Really 5* for all staff of this hotel, all of them are amazingly polite and very helpful.  The hotel rooms are not the same anymore some of the furniture is very old and some of it they have replaced.  Looks like the hotel is in need of some more renovation.  As expected the rooms can be very far from the lobby and might have to walk a lot.   Thanks to all the staff for making our stay comfortable.  "
5,"Like a typical Grand Hyatt chain, this hotel offers nothing than the best. My room was very spacious that can actually fit 4 adult!  The landscape of the hotel is flat, typicall of those in Nusa Dua BTDC. It is arguably the oldest and the largest hotel in the area.  Normally, Head of States, Presidents, PMs - they will either stay in Hyatt or Four Season. The security and protocol basically upto VBIP standard.  I stayed in 2xxx room whereby designated as a slightly higher than standard room. My only complaint is this hotel WAY too big and a lot of stairs. Might be challenging (still possible) for those in wheelchair. "
2,"The hotel is nearly a quater of a century old and the rooms definitely need to revamp.  Sadly the room was infested with small insects like tiny ants and others. It was surprising to see so many insects in the room on the fourth floor.  Previous guests must have complained but nothing done?  Also molds were noticeable in the shower room.

4,We returned to the Grand Hyatt this April after having first stayed there in September 2016. This  was our 6th trip to Bali which we first visited in 1987. We are past the hustle and bustle of the bars and shops of Kuta and Legian and we just like to lie on the beach without being bothered as was our experience in the Kuta-Legian area. You will be occasionally accosted but it is easily dealt with. The gardens of the Grand Hyatt are beautiful and very well established. The pools are many and the children tend to favour the slide pool area. The hotel has 600 rooms and yet we never felt overwhelmed by crowds. The hotel is 26 years old and the rooms are looking a little tired but a still spacious (ocean view) and comfortable. The staff are most attentive to your needs and will…
5,"Great food, good music, beach facing open restaurant, excellent service.. recommend take time to enjoy dinner in this place in Hyatt grand. However, checking in takes some time, can be improved. Room service is excellent."
5,"Stunning landscaped grounds, beautiful secure beach. Our room was very spacious, air conditioning worked well. We had a Lagoon room that was literally facing onto a huge pond full of koi ect. Beautiful. Enjoyed some very nice dinners, especially Teppinyaki with a very cute chef to boot. A few small gripes that one will find anywhere. A secure clean shopping centre is a 2 minute walk. I wouldnt hesitate to stay here again.  "
5,"The resort is very large with beautiful beachfront property, Every amenity is located on the property and if you need to leave the property it is a 10 minute cab ride.. tranquility at its best. Rest and relaxation just happens naturally."
5,"Rooms large and comfortable, staff well trained and friendly. A choice of many restaurants serving a great variety of food. Amazing well cared for gardens, beautiful waterlill ponds. choice of swimming pools."

4,You'll get your money's worth here. The resort has a very nice courtyard and a private beach. Kids will enjoy the pool area in midst of tropical flowers. Foods are superb and staffs are very helpful. The only complain we have is  the post vacation blues we have to overcome after staying in the paradise.
4,"The resort is gorgeous. The rooms are comfy. We were put up in the beach front rooms and the view from the balcony was just spectaculour. The only drawback were a few staff members, who needs to have the Hyatt standards of a smiling face and a genourous hospitality. Once improved on that, then I could rate them a 5 on 5. "
5,"We stayed for 10 nights and had a memorable stay. Excellent clean, well kept grounds, beautiful private beach front and swimming pools and fitness facilities. All the staff very friendly and goes out of the way to make your stay enjoyable. Serves good breakfasts and have good restaurants. Location wise very convenient."
5,We had a two week business meeting at this hotel. The service and hospitality was first class.  Miss Dhiny Nathalya provided our group with personalized service and she is a professional.  She checked in with us often and was able to meet and exceed all our business expectations.  We also stayed the hotel and were able to relax after work at this full resort hotel. There are ample restaurants to choose from and the rooms are very clean and comfortable.  Walking around the beautiful garden style grounds is a pleasure and there is always something to do or you can just relax by the many pools or private beach.
5,"Amazing resort, everything was just perfect, the staff were a fantastic representation of the balinese people, nothing was too much trouble, if you ever need anything ask for Eky in food services he will make you give this place a 10 out of 10"

5,"Amazingly beautiful gardens that have been featured in garden books, extremely friendly and helpful staff, great location on the beach and near local shopping centre and restaurants, spacious and clean rooms.........very, very, very, very, very relaxing. One of the best resorts I have stayed at anywhere in the world."
4,Comfortable hotel and excellent facilities. Staff mixed attitudes !! Great location as it is right opposite the Bali Collection which has great Shopping and Food and Beverage opportunities. Sea bathing and water Sports Activities may not be the best though.
5,"We had a ball staying there 10 nights via a deal from Luxury Escapes. All restaurants served delicious food and staff were very accommodating. we have a son with multiple allergies and the kitchen staff cooked him fresh muffins and pancakes each morning. Gluten free pasta and bread was available. The pools and pool slides were fabulous fun and the beach was excellent. There was a shopping precinct across the road (Bali Collection) which has OK shopping, but wonderful restaurants with live music and very reasonably priced spa facilities. We will be coming again!"
5,What an amazing experience! The club rooms are spacious and the serivce is very friendly yet professional. Nampu teppanyaki is the best I've ever had hands down! A must to try in Bali whether you are a guest or just visiting Bali.  
1,"Hotel needs overall upgrading and it's is not Grant Hyatt standards. Family of 2 young kids, I was not very impressed with the room conditions and facilities for kids ! Very small kid swimming pool, and only activity is one slite. Food was needs improvement and very poor for compare to other Grand Hyatt standards in world. "

5,"From the rustic appearance of the rooms to the quality of the service and the attitude of the staff was grand in every possible way. I felt very much at home with the very cordial and welcoming staff all around the resort. The beach and pool facilities were absolutely clean and the ambience and the quality of the breakfast at the Garden Cafe and Salsa Verde were outstanding. The proximity of the hotel to the Bali Collection further made my stay here absolutely enjoyable and memorable. I would definitely come back to Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua without a doubt and would highly recommend it to all my friends, family and to all of you reading my review. Keep up the grand standards!!"
5,"I came to Bali for a conference and didn't think too much about where I stayed as long as it was close to the conference. That all changed when I walked through the door and realised I was in paradise. The grounds to the hotel are beautiful, tropical gardens, water gardens and pristine beachfront. The rooms were extremely clean with aircon (very much needed, especially at night as the temperature didn't drop below 25C at night) with plenty of room to spread out. Multiple restaurants onsite, plus a range of tourist shops. Buses call regularly if you want to get out and about in wider Bali but with a spa onsite, pools, and super friendly staff, why leave?"
4,"This hotel is beautiful and features fish ponds and Lilly pads in an open air reception/Lobby area. The pick up at the airport was a relief, and the staff were very friendly and accomodating as I have a young family. The pools are stunning and my 3yo spent nearly the entire days on the waterslide! The food was so-so. The breakfast was lovely with a ton of choice and options for all diets and nationalities. The garden cafe and the salsa verde meals we had were average. The drinks are extremely expensive which is disappointing as my husband paid $8.50aud for a can of beer! The rooms are bright and well air conditioned and have a separate little cove with a bed for my kids to sleep on. sadly the mattresses are extremely hard!! Our room also has a musty smell. However it is very…"
5,"Stay in this hotel so many times. Staffs are friendly, polite and always accommodate our need. We love the beach, the pool and the garden. Food always ok. The Japanese restaurant is exceptional. We always enjoy the club lounge."
4,"We stayed at Grand Hyatt last week, now when back seeing continuously the photos we clicked. Nice location, nicely placed various amenities, very big property, well maintained, over all very good. Being strict vegetarian, got very good support from the chefs in all the restaurants. Being little old now, the room interiors require a kind of renovation. Overall a wonderful experience.   The most important, very much price competitive.   Good one   Thanks"

5,Wow wow we loved this place Would come back againGreat pools food people beach Just purrrfect Our room was 3108 amazing view Driver was Made Suardana see review excellent Just go and stay there There is the shopping centre just walking distance Good food clean great stuff to buy not expensive Sogo has everything  Dinner pp  $10 Guess bags on sale under $70 
5,"The best holiday for family fun and relation that we have had. The resort is truly beautiful, it really felt like we had entered paradise. The food was amazing and the staff so friendly and helpful. Our 6 year old son has multiple severe allergies to food and I was very worried about his diet, but the hotel looked after him very well. They cooked him pancakes without wheat, egg, or milk and gluten free muffins, they even had gluten free bread and pasta. We very incredibly grateful as it took the stress out of it for us, and he got to eat well."
3,"Browsed the hotel's website and fell in love with the hotel view and surroundings. We spent only two nights over the weekend. We visit Bali quite often and love to check out new hotels/villas. We loved this hotel surrounding..a lot of places to stroll around, relax and take photos. The restaurants are also great and serve a variety of dishes. The traditional kecak dance dinner @ Pasar Senggol was also awesome although we have experienced many times before.  Although the room has ocean view and a partial garden view, we did not like it at all.  The room really needs refurb. Although Due to this we  spent  as little time as possible in it - just for a quick shower and  to sleep after supper.  The furniture is really old and we couldn't feel that usual ""Bali ambience"" when in the…"
5,"When I arrived the hotel, there was someone at lobby to welcome me. I didn't check in,it was done by hotel.The hotel is big,also has a lot of trees, beautiful views....etc. I think it's a kind of resort hotel. I always brought the map along with me otherwise, I should lose the way to my room. It is a good hotel, worth your coming."
4,"This is a very large hotel set in beautiful grounds and on a nice stretch of beach.  There are lots of places to eat and all restaurants are very good, although the Italian is a little uninspiring.  The Japanese restaurant in particular is well worth a visit and VERY good. The rooms are a good size and the staff really cannot do enough to please.  The only issues we found were that the drinks are very expensive and even in non-smoking rooms, people can smoke on the balcony which can get pretty bad in the humid conditions in Bali.  We asked to move as we could not use our balcony due to a chain smoker and they were very good and gave us an excellent replacement within a couple of hours.  The pool areas are very well thought out and have areas for adults and children alike and…"

5,"The Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua exceeded our expectations in every way, beautiful grounds, fantastic beach, great room and staff were incredibly helpful and could never do enough for you. Location for us was good for us as far enough away from the crowds but close enough to local restaurants and bars if you wanted a change from the hotel food."
4,"Went for a 3 nights at the ""North Village"" with 5 other business colleague. We were booked two connecting bedrooms: Grand Suite King & Grand Twin.   The Grand Suite King is quite spacious for 5 people. They offered a spacious bathroom with it's own separate shower & bathtub, as well as a separate toilet. There's also a ""living room"" and a small dining table. And a small cabana-ish sofa next to the living room, facing the balcony. The building is one of the earliest to build in the area, as such no ""usb"" plug is available yet so bring in your plug converter. There were some issue with the toilet spray and shower, but the rest was good.   The Grand Twin was okay in terms of space, also had the cabana like the Suite. There were no issue on the bathroom, but there is an issue with…"
3,Nice and very clean hotel however very expensive for food and drinks. Our check in days where originally messed up by the hotel and no apologies where made for their mistake. Had to fix the problem myself. Thought this was extremely rude. Hotel is also very understaffed - lots of waiting around for food and drinks. 
4,"I stayed here with my family in April 2017. The room, near the reception, was great. My 9 year old twins loved the corner bed. Breakfast was good, but extremely busy for a few days of the stay, we had to wait to be seated. The kids loved the slide. The beach was beautiful, the tide goes out miles, so swimming, if calm enough, is only for part of the day. The Japanese restaurant was VERY expensive, over £250 for 4 (we only ordered for 3 and had one drink each!!!). We used the Salsa Verde restaurant most nights as the kids enjoyed the pizzas, etc, it was quite good. We were disappointed in the Bali Collection complex behind the hotel, all the restaurants had the same style menu, the one we tried was really not great. Overall, beautiful hotel with stunning grounds. Great for…"

5,"Just enjoyed another 16 nights, our second visit from the UK in 10 months!!! (37 night total).  Its's a long haul but well worth it on arrival...  We choose the club access which offers, its own tranquil pool area and beautiful gardens together with a separate unique club lounge setting for breakfast, evening drinks and snacks.  The staff are absolutely fantastic and always make our stay truly special... Nothing is too much trouble for the Balinese!!!"
5,This is an exceptional hotel with beautiful extensive grounds and facilities. The beach is lovely and the multiple pools are stunning with rock and waterfall features. The food is amazing and the service is exceptional!
1,"When I stay at the Hyatt, I expect Hyatt service. 4 nights into an 8 night stay, there is a problem. You have to just about beg for coffee and tea at breakfast, let alone a refill of your small coffee cup. It's easier to have a bespoke omelette cooked for you! We went to the bar tonight and were delighted to have our drink orders taken promptly; they arrived 40 minutes later... the order had been forgotten! We had to remind them! We then went to the nearby restaurant. The reservation we carefully made 2 days ago had gone missing! Anyway, we were seated and placed our order, asking that the herbal tea we wanted, be served with dessert. Big mistake. You can guess what was served before the first of 3 courses arrived. Herbal tea! Friendly but incompetent and frustrating is how I…"
3,great location but an out dated hotel. service is great from the staff. Breakfast buffet is very limited for that price and over crowded during peak hours.  room air con did not work during the entire stay very hard to get good sleep at the end of the day.
3,"I'm somewhat surprised that Grand Hyatt put their name to this property. Its old and rundown and desperately in need of a revamp. The hotel boosts a massive 600 rooms so its far from an intimate experience with busloads of package tourists spending a night or two here (and joining you at your breakfast table if you are lucky enough and have a spare seat). We stayed here on a luxury escapes package and would not choose to stay here again or otherwise.  Positives: - The huge grounds are immaculate and beautifully maintained - The waterslide (when its actually working) - The location Negatives: - Rooms and facilities are old, rundown and in desperate need of a proper clean - The food in all restaurants was well below average - breakfast is the same every morning and be prepared to…"

3,great location but an out dated hotel. service is great from the staff. Breakfast buffet is very limited for that price and over crowded during peak hours.  room air con did not work during the entire stay very hard to get good sleep at the end of the day.
3,"I'm somewhat surprised that Grand Hyatt put their name to this property. Its old and rundown and desperately in need of a revamp. The hotel boosts a massive 600 rooms so its far from an intimate experience with busloads of package tourists spending a night or two here (and joining you at your breakfast table if you are lucky enough and have a spare seat). We stayed here on a luxury escapes package and would not choose to stay here again or otherwise.  Positives: - The huge grounds are immaculate and beautifully maintained - The waterslide (when its actually working) - The location Negatives: - Rooms and facilities are old, rundown and in desperate need of a proper clean - The food in all restaurants was well below average - breakfast is the same every morning and be prepared to…"
4,"The place is great. The pools, the beach ( if there are not dropped tree busses of Chinees tourist). The rooms needs some accoustic protection. That is a must when your neighbour is a double ADHD child! But for a 5 star hotel the breakfast must be better organized: From 6 times whe had to waite 5 times to be sited. Fresh juice is a must on Bali in a 5 star hotel. This was water with a bad colour and not juice."
5,"Hotel room is big, Clean, comfortable. The shower is the best. has a bath tub.  The bed is KING size. I can't complain about anything about this hotel other than it's abit old but you have everything that you wanted. 2 big swimming pool. A beach that is about 400 meter end to end.  low tide you can walk about 100m in. find some small fish and make a sand castle. Great Family hotel. Kids just loved it. she didn't wanna go home. Very Recommended"
4,"we are talking Hyatt, of course they did a good job in this hotel ! very beautiful architecture and I love all the corner. Nusa Dua is perfect if you are looking quite place and of course with  wonderful beach. The only limitations is 2 things : 1st, this is very big property with several buildings that unfortunately almost look the same which can be confusing to find the way especially during the first days. And for #2, despite so many good restaurant nearby Nusa Dua, I cant feel the Bali vibe ( I mean with local culture, ambience, etc ). But I will definitely come back to Hyatt :)     "
2,"This place is pretty average, probably ok if you have children as the pools are nice but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. The onsite restaurants are pretty bland and overpriced for the quality of food. Ordered room service and they sent the wrong dish, they only offered to take off the cost of desert for their mistake.  There's not much atmosphere and the rooms are dated in need of modernisation. There are nicer places you can stay in Bali than here.  "
4,Manicured Bali hotel set in beautiful grounds. Only very poor experience with check out experience. Club option well worth it as food and drinks available all day and food delicious. Very big spread out hotel.

5,"We have stayed twice now at the Grand Hyatt in Bali and have loved it both times. The resort is amazing with its huge pools and wonderful lagoon and rock formations winding you from one pool to the next. Having a 5 and 8 year old we couldn't have stayed at a better resort. The staff are friendly and attentive and take special care when it comes to dietary requirements (I am coeliac). The meal prices are a bit on the high side within the resort, but the Bali Collection is just across the road which offers a wide variety of international restaurants at lower prices. Within the compound hagglers are restricted so you are not faced with people pushing their wares at you constantly. The entire area is safe and quiet and we will return as soon as we are able. Cannot recommend this…"
4,"This is a huge hotel with more 1000 employees, nice view... i can see the beach from lobby. If traveling with kids you should accompany them other wise they got lost. The room was comfort, the wifi quite fast. I can nor inform the price... "
5,I am a fan of the Hyatt hotels around the world and there's a reason for it!  The staffs are amazing!  They do care about you and is always ready to accommodate your needs.  The Grand Hyatt Bali is a great destination when you want some R&R and some work done!  The work part is hard when you are surrounded with so much lush and water!  :-)
4,"Stayed for 5 nights in March at the club rooms that offer separate swimming pool and also breakfast,  free drinks and light dinner through the day and night. The hotel covers a massive area and trying to  find your room can be tricky some times. The rooms are spacious and clean but dated, specially the timber which tells the age of the hotel. The beach is very close and clean but i can not say the same for the water that we found it not so interesting as we are from Cyprus and the waters here are by far better. The service we got was PERFECT in all areas. Overall it was a very good stay without any unexpected problems. "
1,After two weeks of travel I chose to end my stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali. Having had such great experiences at Hyatt's elsewhere around the world I really had high expectation. I arrive only to learn that the ocean view room I booked was not available. The manager was rude and didn't seem to care one bit that he essentially ruined the end of my vacation including two tours I had booked to see Uluwatu and Mt. Batur.  As I was dealing with my own matter I overheard a woman next to me complaining of bed bugs. Taking this all into account I canceled and found accommodations at least for one night while I re-plan the end of my vacation. My advise is to stay away from this property until they fire and replace the manager Soma. No way I can recommend for anyone to spend one dollar at…

5,"We took two teenage girls and stayed 8 nights on a Luxury Escapes package.  Loved it, beautiful beach, pool and grounds, fantastic friendly helpful staff, lovely food.  The  rooms are older but very comfortable and clean.  Great location will easy access to the Bali Collection for a huge choice of restaurants and shops, easy access to Kuta and Seminyak thanks to new toll road."
5,"The 3 night stay was overall a great experience which was enhanced by the upgrade to the suite.  The hotel was clean, well kept and offered a great selection of food.  Friendly and caring staff as well as a nice location.  Will come back for sure!"
5,"My family (2 adults, 2 girls 7&4) stayed for 3 nights and loved it. The pools were great with lots of different areas to get away from everyone, plus the slide was awesome for the kids. The gardens was perfectly looked after and the trees work well around the pools creating shade, instead of umbrellas. We went with the ""club"" package which I couldn't go without next time, it has a separate area for checking in/out, food and pool.  It includes breakfast, and from 5-7pm food and drinks, which mostly covers dinner off and a early buzz. The resort is close to 2 surf breaks (nusa dua/impossibles & Sri Lanka) and Bali Collection, so you can get your real Bali fix without a long travel. Food and drinks are much cheaper out of the resort. The only thing I would recommend is a better bar…"
5,"Travelling family of 5 with kids ages (10-17) and are long time visitors to Hyatt Hotels.  We booked two rooms which ended up being at opposite ends of the resort but they had called beforehand to check whether we wanted them closer together.  Rooms generous  sized ( Ocean View and Executive Suite) with one view of beach and other the large lake. Both had very large bathrooms and balconies plus plenty of wardrobe space and storage.  We had breakfast included at the Garden Cafe daily which is a great and varied Western and Asian buffet.  Most of time was spent by pool and the kids enjoyed the small waterslide, and eating lunch at the pool bar which has a standard menu ( burgers, fish and chips, salad).  We had dinner a couple of times at the Salsa Verde restaurant which was…"
2,"On the surface, this hotel is clean and modern with beautifully maintained gardens. The staff are polite and smiley and the beach is shady with a cooling breeze.   So, why only two stars?  We were due to check in at 1.00pm but as we were touring around on our way from Ubud, we didn't arrive until nearer 5.00 pm. Our room was not ready and we were offered a twin room instead. We declined and were offered a free soft drink in the Garden Room Cafe while we waited for the double room we had booked to be ready. I asked for a melon juice. After some time, they said they did not have melon juice. I settled for orange juice. I was brought a glass of undrinkable pulp. Thankfully the room was ready by now so I abandoned the free drink and headed off to the room.  The room was clean and…"

4,Excellent view and great hotel room. The staff members were very friendly and accommodating. We got excellent upgrade saving from Garden View room to Grand Club Executive suite so my whole family could enjoy the facilities with memorable experience. My family and I really enjoyed our short stay there. We will definitely come back to Grand Hyatt Bali for our next Bali holidays.
4,"We traveled on a Luxury Escapes package. Great value, kids loved the pools and waterslide, massages were exceptional. Restaurants are well priced and very good quality, service is exceptional. Kids Club is horrendously expensive, as are beverages at this resort. "
5,It was April school holidays  Weather was perfect with afternoon rain for short periods  Room was excellent  The staff are very friendly  Special thanks to Mr Amrit Gurung who even though he was obviously very busy took time to ensure any concerns we had were alleviated
1,"Great hotel located in a great place on the island.  It is in an enclave where other nice hotel such as Ritz Carlton, Hilton, etc., are located.  They share a beautiful stretch of beach.  The hotel is, however, a bit dated in that the chair cushions could use a replacement.  We also felt the comforter on the bed could be much thinner."
4,"We travelled on luxury escapes package as family of 5 (2adults, 3 Kids). On arrival we were greeted warmly, such beautiful, kind people the Balinese. We had an interconnecting ground floor lagoon view room in the south wing. The rooms are ok, very clean, serviced daily, heaps of bottled water, everything I requested was supplied. The rooms are dated however, not modern but still fine. The resort is beautful, pool excellent for the kids, beautiful beach. I found food ok however i am super fussy, my husband ate everything. Japanese restaurant a highlight, great sushi also. We dined at Salsa Verde for dinner most nights, good pizza and pasta. The resort is busy with big Chinese groups which was fine but not ideal for relaxing family holiday. Kids club good but expensive, beautiful…"

Kriya Spa a very special treat. It's perfect with kids, pool is spacious and interesting. Lots of shade poolside and by the beach. Yoga with Ashley is a great way to start the day. Can't wait for next trip."

5,"I just spent 8 days at Grand Hyatt Bali, and it was so enjoyable. The food was amazing, and varied, and the people so friendly and wanting to make your stay enjoyable. Best to try each of the restaurants, my favourite was Nampu, where we had the Teppanyaki."
3,We booked hotel through a luxury escapes package so value for money. However everything outside of the package was very expensive. We found other resorts along the same beach strip to be more value for money. Hotel itself lovely and beautiful grounds. Just very expensive.
3,Grand Hyatt is located in good location and in front of hotel there is small mall called Bali collection so you can go there for shopping and there is restaurants and supermarket  Stuff are not much friendly ( some of them)  Breakfast was not up to the mark and their cups are smelly

Multiple pools with interesting grottoes. they have a show every night with native musicians and dancers and a grand buffet of the local foods.  There is a breakfast buffet every morning and a good way to start the day. The hotel is in the privately secured of Nusa Dua, but has access to a good shopping center within 5 minutes walk. You may not want to leave the hotel grounds. Overall highly recommended."

Spacious, quiet and fully air-conditioned rooms with plenty of privacy.  Wonderful staff EVERYWHERE and wonderful inclusions including massage, pedicure, cocktails, buffet breakfasts and complimentary lunches and dinners thrown in."
4,"Nice rooms ,large and well maintained ,lovely pools with waterslide.You need to be aware that you have to pay for kids club and there are no activities or games room for kids as we have always had in other hotels.Good location straight across from Bali Collections.Lots of good restaurants."
5,"Our stay at Grand Hyatt was fantastic! All staff were so lovely and would do all they could to assist us. They all loved our children and greeted them warmly every time they saw them. Food at each restaurant was fantastic and always a high standard of cleanliness. Our 3 1/2 year old loved the water slide and so did we. It is great for all ages, children and adults! "
5," The best gardens I have seen in any property ever, and I doubt this will be topped. The gardens are impressive and out of this world. The pool is also a huge win and our daughter loved it as much as we did.  Our check in wasn't great. Took just over 30 minutes and we had travelled about a day. Not good. The chap checking us in was slow. We were greeted with a refreshment.  The hotel room was spacious, we were located in the west village. Very comfortable, clean, great AC.  The hotel is dated and does need slight attention to detail in some areas. Surprising that a hotel of this status is lacking in this area. Ice buckets without lids or chipped lids. Silicone coming away in the bathroom between tiles.  We had a very nice reading/lounge area with lots of seating. Some of the…"

4,"My family spent five days at the Grand Hyatt.  Check in and out was quick and easy.  Our suite was beautiful and easily accommodated our family of four.  The hotel grounds were well taken care of and continually cleaned.  When we arrived the beach was a mess but the staff was out in force and it was clean for the rest of our stay.  At high tide we had a lot of fun swimming and learning to surf.  At low tide we could explore the large sandbar but you need to wear shoes so bring water shoes if you have them.  The food became tiresome and I felt it was overpriced but across the street from the hotel is a outside mall with a lot of choices as well as shopping.  We took a half day private tour to Ubud to the Monkey Village, Butterfly Gardens etc. and it was fantastic.  Our driver and…"
3,"So arrived to this place and I was mesmerized by the gardens which are amazing!  I have to say the gardens and the facilities are top, with a level of 5 star hotel. I have to say I loved the pool, the slide which entertains children and adults. The gym is great. The position is nice too with the beach, but on the same beach there are other hotels. But let's speak about the rooms.  We had an ocean room, spacious enough with comfortable beds! And this is the positive aspect of the room. There is no real wardrobe and places where to put your stuff. The rooms are somehow old. They should need a bit of refurbishing. The bathroom is ok-ish, but again not a lot of space, bathtub is old. Amenities are basic.   I found that the worst of the hotel was the Salsa verde restaurant where we…"

5,"Do not look for other place in Bali-Nusa Dua if you are with kids. This is the best hotel for families and for people who want to see the paradise...Nice food (little expensive but i think is normal) Perfect staff, Paradise  garden and pools. Unique beach. What else do you need.. I have being travel in more than 40 countries but i have never see more beautiful place than this..."
4,"Very nice stay and good ratio quality price! Great rooms, beautiful set up, gardens ,statues, trees. Beach is private, nice and clean and lots of activities for the kids ( pools, water slides, games etc...) Quality of the food is also pretty good! Wine list is quite limited and expensive if you want a non local wine but beer is cheap. Cocktails are good but not amazing. The only miss is the service. Granted there are lots of people to serve and the staff is charming and smiling but the service is slow and far from efficient. If you can relax and not focus on average to below average service at the restaurants or by the pools you will have the dream holiday! Feedback for hotel management: improve training of the waiters to increase efficiency and customer satisfaction.   Having…"

If you can relax and not focus on average to below average service at the restaurants or by the pools you will have the dream holiday! Feedback for hotel management: improve training of the waiters to increase efficiency and customer satisfaction.   Having…"
5,"We stayed at Grand Hyatt for 5 nights. Beautiful hotel and exceptional service! Great location in Nusa Dua, short walk to Bali Connection with bunch of restaurants and shopping. Spa at the hotel is such a zen! Loved our stay and would definitely recommend Grand Hyatt Bali to my friends and family."
5,"Had a great holiday. Would go back again in a heartbeat!  All the staff were super friendly and helpful, it was lovely and close to Bali collection too so cheaper meals were close by f we needed them.."
5,This is our first time to Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua and it certainly wont be our last.  The hotel grounds are spectacular and the staff members are amazing. Nothing is too much trouble. Each staff member we encountered went out of their way to ensure all of our wishes were exceeded. I must name one of the staff members from the Garden Cafe (Sudi). He is star in an already stella team. This hotel is amazing but it is clear that the people that work here are the real highlight. Great Job Grand Hyatt!
5,"From the moment we've arrived in this beautiful property the staff welcome is with a big and genuine smile , the room was very clean and the housekeeping service was absolute superb ,the food was good and the rates of of the hotel outlets very reasonable.if you want a relaxing vacation with a nice service we highly recommend the grand Hyatt in Bali .    "
3,Positives are club level the staff were efficient and friendly  Great place to relax  Spacious rooms  Beautiful gardens  Negatives it's huge took us a few days to find our way around  Staff were slow at restaurants and bars

2,Unpleasent stay! Hotel has capacity issues! We had to wait every day in a queue to reach the breakfast buffet although we tried every day to go to a different restaurant of the 3 restaurants offering breakfast at the hotel. 
4,"Grand Hyatt is huge. It is outdated but well maintained. Unfortunately the rain did not let us enjoy most of our stays. It rained on and off. GH is just like any other hotel/Resorts has its pros and cons. One of the reason why I only give four stars.  Here's why..  Pros  1. My husband and I enjoyed and appreciated the Diamond suite upgrade. We loved our room. Location was perfect for us. It's very close to the lounge. A few steps away to the Grand club pool and to the main swimming pool. A little walk to the beach but not so bad. 2. Hotel staff were all accommodating, friendly and professional. Special mention to Uri and others at the lounge. Food at the lounge was good but not much selections. Good wine. I enjoyed the getuk, a local dish.  3. A special thanks to the lady at the…"
5,"I have visited Indonesia many times for business and holiday but this was the first time to Bali and the Grand Hyatt hotel. One of the best experiences of my life. Came with family. Everybody loved the hotel, the grounds, our rooms, the Grand Club lounge and most important the staff. What kind, courteous and helpful people. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, every staff person went out of there way to make our stay special."
5,"As per last time to this hotel{3 time), we were really looking forward to our stay, but we were extra excited because we were having the club room experience and all its benefits . when we arrived, we were taken, not to the usual front desk, but to the club lounge for a very relaxed and professional check in with cool towels and cool fruit drink.This lasted about 15 minutes and then shown to our room. The room (2245) was first floor over looking a well stocked pond that had koi carp and also fantastic wild life from birds to lizards.The room was spacious with good size king bed and good seating area. The bathroom consisted of his and her sinks, massive wardrobe and mirror and a wet room with big bath tub. You could access the balcony from the wet room which was novel. The club…"
5,"This is our 3rd visit to the Grand Hyatt, our 1st stay in the club rooom, the service was exceptional. From the moment we arrived and taken to the club lounge for check in. I cannot find fault with anything, the room 2245 was lovely huge king bed, lovely sitting area,and great bathroom and changing area. Also great views from balcony over looking the superb ponds.The staff are amazing and nothing is to much trouble for them. Breakfasts are amazing anything you want and they will get it for you. The snacks in the evening amazing. The setting was really lovely. The club swimming pool was very nice and private.I would like to say a big thank you to Yani who served us breakfast each morning bringing us our tea and coffee as soon as we walked in with a fantastic smile.Also to Urip…"

5,"My family and I stayed at the Club Wing, ground floor with seating area adjacent to the pool (accessible only for Club Wing). The kids loved it so much as they have direct access to the pool. The sprawling garden was amazing, and the beach is just across the walkway. The hotel also has its ""resident animals"" (ducks/iguana/ birds/) roaming freely at their designated area at the garden which was really exciting especially for the kids. The breakfast and tea time spread at the Club Lounge  was lovely. Service by the hotel staff was commendable.I don't have anything negative to say about this hotel except for the fact that we had to leave after that lovely break! Definitely coming back."
5,"This resort is enormous, a gargantuan collection of lovely Balinese lakes, gardens, and wildlife. The grounds, particularly the East Village and South Village are in excellent condition. The quality of the build is very good. The gardens are second to none in Bali. That would be my first point - idyllic location.  Secondly, the facilities are excellent - there are a great number of pools, and they are landscaped very well and different from many other resorts. There are temples within the complex, lots of winding paths and nooks and crannies, so wonderful to explore.  Thirdly, this place has something for everyone - families, couples and people travelling alone. The pool slides and the kids club are great. The kids club you have to pay, but it is worth it as there are structured…"
5,"Brilliant hotel. The grounds and wildlife are magnificent - a standard bearer for a resort hotel, and I have stayed in many.  For families, couples, individuals there is something for everyone. My recommendations  1) Stay in the Grand Club - brilliant service and great food. The breakfast is listed as ""continental"" but actually there is plenty of cooked food - eggs, bacon, etc. Fruit, breads, cold cuts, hot and cold drinks (made to order). The staff are amazingly kind and flexible. The grounds for breakfast and evening canapés (great food and variety and drinks) are fantastic, overlooking Balinese pools with ducks, lizards, fish and other little creatures. The grounds are number one in Bali! 2) Grand Club Garden View is great if overlooking the Balinese pool, lovely to be awaken…"
5,"i came last week to celebrate anniversary, it was so.n ice they put flowers in the room . the ressort is very nice huge clean. wifi is excellent people so friendly,really its five stars hotel. i will repeat it."
4,"Stayed here for a couple of night before joining a cruise. Thought the room was very good, nice little balcony, but the best points were the extensive gardens and the outdoor (but covered) club facility.  The breakfasts were excellent and the drinks and nibbles in the evening were also very good.  One thing to bear in mind is that the property is very large, it is quite a hike from the front reception to the club area.  The staff were friendly and helpful in arranging transport for us.  One small moan, one of our balcony lights did not work, although it was fixed fairly quickly, and the shades were not that easy to get to remain down.  Would happily stay here again though."

4,Not used to staying in such a large hotel  a little to crowded for me on Nyepi day the main pool was so over crowded it was dangerous  Other than that it was wonderful  Salsa verde restaurant excellent breakfast lunch dinner  Salsa bar beautiful view  enjoyed time there 
5,"Over 30 plus years of traveling, I've stayed at numerous hotels and resorts from Karlsruhe to Yerevan to Luang Prabang (which up to now was the best) and this stay topped them all.  The beaches, clear ocean waters, pools and the food exceeded all expectations."
5,"i have stay there for spend my time on Nyepi day at hotel for 2 Nights, everything was great, the staff helpful and also they have stunning pool and very big, i dont get bored while stay there, lot activity i could do, Breakfast was good, recommended for luxury stay in bali, Some tips if you book Standard room try to request with beach view (only partial view)"
5,"We had a fantastic week at the hotel recently. Our holiday included several massages at the excellent Kriya Spa and massage centre, several meals at the Italian, Japanese and Indonesian restaurants as part of the deal."
5,"Had an amazing stay at the Hyatt Bali for our Honeymoon. We are really delighted by the hotel location, its staff service and food. Right from the check in till our check out we were always happy and never got any clue to complain. One suggestion to hotel.. Would have been great if you guys had the complementary shuttle to visit nearby places and airport."

5,"I stay at Grand Hyatt Bali for Nyepi Day. Great location, near to Bali collection grounds was beautiful with more than enough pools, the pool very enjoyable.一整天在游泳池.the water slide is so much fun. Friendly staff,beautiful private beach."
5,"We only got back tonite from an amazing 8 nites at Grand Hyatt Bali, we were very sad to leave such a beautiful and majestic place. I am honestly surprised it does not rate higher than the other surrounding hotels, whose grounds looked a lot smaller and a little unkept.  Food, although more expensive than other places in Bali, was still quite a lot cheaper than other 5-star resorts here in Australia for  example, plus kids ate at 50% off adult meal prices. For example, a meal for the 4 of us at Nampu Japanese restaurant cost us just under 100 AUD.  Our Kids loved the Kids Club (Camp Nusa) and I would like to thank them for all they did, especially Suar and Indah. The activities were great and our kids loved the staff and the cute little kids club premises, where they did some…"
5,The best point was that we can walk to Bali Collection. Wide and various swimming pools with water slider. Also can enter beach and swim when low tide. Best hotel in Nusa Dua for family with small children.
4,"It was another Bali holiday. I've bought Luxury Escapes package. We loved resort. Facilities and staff are excellent. Beautiful landscape. Food experience was less exciting. Breakfast was fine but dinners could be better. I would not recommend it for couples but for families it's perfect, our daughter loved pools."

We was stayed at Grand Club room with stunning views of tropical garden combine with lagoon we were so pampered with all the club benefits such as privileged access to exclusive Grand Club pool with continental breakfast, all day refreshment and evening hours at Garden Cafe…"
4,I went to Bali second year in a row. This visit was OK. I liked the resort. Landscape is amazing. Staff was excellent. Food was satisfying. I don't think we would stay there again. It was too crowded. Good for families but if you wish to have quiet holiday go somewhere else.
4,"The service was nice The staff are very friendly and accommodating. Fresh tropical flowers everywhere. Beautiful lobby. Had a great experience with their spa. price was it was excellent. For local food and shopping Bali Collection just a walking distance from the hotel entrance. its a great location. Though from Hyatt experience they need some maintenance, old fittings, the room where we checked in the air con wasn't working then again had to change the room. other than that it was a pleasant experience.  "
5,This hotel has very very large garden with many birds and unfortunetly lizards... there was a lot of amasing statues and places  The hotel shore was very nice and there was lots of facilities and entertaiment around it
1,my korean guess very dissapointed when check in cause he must pay addtional room for his kid under 12 years. refer to hotel policy via agoda website children under 12 years should be free when join room with his parent. he argue about this with receptionist but not have clear explanation and they dont allow him to check in until he pay another room. really is not a good for his travelling experience

4,"This is a hotel that I never would have chosen for myself, but Melissa at Beach Bum Vacation hooked us up with this five star resort. This place is massive, with lilly ponds, marble and fresh tropical flowers everywhere. Truly beautiful. My favorite part of the Hyatt was the many, and different pools it has. Their river like lagoon pool made me feel like I was in a whole other place, and this professional mermaid was REALLY wishing she had brought her tail! What an interesting place! If you just wanted a quiet place to relax after all that excitement you can head over to the Gym/Spa pool. They have two saunas, a cold plunge pool, indoor heated pool and the outside pool. It was pure bliss. Thank you Hyatt and thank you Melissa and Beach Bum Vacation!!!"
5,"Service Excellent. Grounds magnificent, Luxury Escapes package again superb. The hotel staff, service and grounds are all excellent. The hotel is however in need of some maintenance, some which is now taking place. The grounds are magnificent and their maintenance outstanding. The Spa treatments included in the package were excellent as were our meals. Nightly cocktails on the roof top looking over the beach and the surf very hard to beat. We had a quiet ground floor room over looking one of the many small lakes. Watching the blue kingfishers, waders and the pet ducks was very relaxing. Every member of staff had a smile and a ""hallo"". It is a very welcoming environment. It is impossible not to be smiling in return."
5,"Really recommend resort for children and families.. With a nice swimming pool and front of the beach.. Friendly staff with a big smile and helpful.. Very nice hotel room ,clean and green place.. Hyatt is wonderful.."
5,Just had the most relaxing holiday at the Hyatt in Nusa Dua.  The staff were awesome and so friendly and all the facilities were first class.  The food was divine and as with any good holiday ate way too much.
4,"We were suppose to get Ocean view room, and instead got tree view room. Management says these are Ocean view room. Location and service are all good except that Hyatt being a great brand should not go that low to make few extra bucks by cheating customers."

1,"Accommodation felt like cheap condos, service slow (bags took forever to arrive), pool over heated, noisy rooms, US$30 for breakfast. Experience not at all consistent with ""Grand Hyatt"" branding. Badly over priced. "
5,i am very satisfied during my stay in this hotel. everything from the start to the end has been satisfying and perfect. Staffs are very friendly and extremely helpful. You will never find another hotel that offers this kind of services.
5,"Superb and excellent hotel in Nusa Dua, Bali. Magnificent view of nature and beach all in this hotel resort. Indeed a recommended for everyone. The room is really good with superb facility. If you love shopping while staying in this hotel, Bali Collection just a walking distance from the hotel entrance"
5,"The best resort, food was amazing, staff even better. Location and facilities was excellent and we will return. Only negative was temperature of room fridge and pillows, two too high and one too low with no other options which was possibly due to staff understanding my request. Meals, snacks and drinks all excellent and the pools and beach were fabulous. Property so big that we continually got lost."
5,"Always wanted to try this Hotel and turned out it was one of the best decision we made, Room was excellent, nice Japanese Restaurant, lovely super large Swimming Pool ( Kid's friendly too ! ), very nice breakfast, great Gym, they have this Restaurant Pasar Senggol, all Food totally ripping, we loved it !!

4,We loved the Grand Hyatt as a family holiday destination. The hotel was beautiful but in places was a bit old and tired. The staff were just so lovely and friendly and were always smiling and helpful. Nothing was ever too much to ask.
2,"A luxury escape holiday - 10 Day VIP Upgrade.  First allocated room was terrible - no outlook and right up the back near the back fence. Hot, no breeze, no other people, and the only thing to look at was the back wall. The Secret Emerald Pool is not nice at all.  Second room was a little better but all we saw was the putting green - no views.  Balcony too hot in the morning to sit outside - no shelter.  The hotel is more like a retirement village - everything closes or is empty by 8pm and you have to look elsewhere for things to do.  Restaurants are just average food and the drinks are a ridiculous price.  $A6.50 a small can of coke, $A16 per cocktail.  Eat at Bali collection or down at one of the other resorts nearby.  There was a lot of confusion initially about the vouchers…"
5,The service was second to none.  The staff are very friendly and accommodating. Nothing was too difficult.   We are looking forward to another stay there in the future.   The accommodation is excellent with clean modern rooms.  They offer great meals and a serene environment.
3,"The hotel was very pretty, the grounds are lovely with stunning Lily Ponds everywhere. the beach stretch is gorgeous as well very pristine. The room size is fabulous and the daybed was just perfect for two small children to sleep on. We found the grounds though just way too large to enjoy, it was such a big walk to reception, the pool and out to the front gate that it made it inconvenient. The restaurant was very pricey and the only other food options nearby were at Bali Collection. If that hadn't of been there it would have been a very expensive trip! We had a room only package and it was very difficult to get breakfast. The Hotel buffet was extremely expensive and nothing at the Bali collection opens until 10 AM. We ended up having to get a taxi out of the area to get…"
4,"We stayed for 7 nights at this 5 star hotel,  The welcome was over whelming, I was like a rabbit in headlights, drinks served, porter rushing around with our bags,half dozen smiling faces all shouting my name, customer service at its highest.  We were given an nice room with a varander looking over a pond. The room would be classed as average I've stayed in more upto date Premiere Inn Hotels, looked very tired in places and not what i would expect from a 5 Star hotel,were they hoping I would upgrade... saving grace a super kingsize bed. The Customer service was excellent a mention for a waitress in Salsa Verdi resturant her name was Suni. Food was of a high standard, and the facilities were good with shops on the complex, and a nice pool. The beach was deserted apart from the…"
4,We loved the Grand Hyatt as a family holiday destination. The hotel was beautiful but in places was a bit old and tired. The staff were just so lovely and friendly and were always smiling and helpful. Nothing was ever too much to ask.
2,"A luxury escape holiday - 10 Day VIP Upgrade.  First allocated room was terrible - no outlook and right up the back near the back fence. Hot, no breeze, no other people, and the only thing to look at was the back wall. The Secret Emerald Pool is not nice at all.  Second room was a little better but all we saw was the putting green - no views.  Balcony too hot in the morning to sit outside - no shelter.  The hotel is more like a retirement village - everything closes or is empty by 8pm and you have to look elsewhere for things to do.  Restaurants are just average food and the drinks are a ridiculous price.  $A6.50 a small can of coke, $A16 per cocktail.  Eat at Bali collection or down at one of the other resorts nearby.  There was a lot of confusion initially about the vouchers…"
5,The service was second to none.  The staff are very friendly and accommodating. Nothing was too difficult.   We are looking forward to another stay there in the future.   The accommodation is excellent with clean modern rooms.  They offer great meals and a serene environment.

5,"Our stay was absolute perfection. The room was large, well designed, and everything we needed was readily available. The resort itself is in an awesome location and although it is huge it was easy to get to whichever amenities we wanted. Every restaurant was great, though we recommend Salsa Verde the most for breakfast, due to the location and ambience.  We made the most of our stay and tried all the restaurants, and all are great. Even the poolside food was delicious and well presented. All the facilities were excellent and well managed. Overall our stay was incredible, and if I have to pick one standout I would say it was the staff. Every single person that we interacted with was friendly, professional, helpful, and genuinely took care to help wherever they could."
1,"The AC in my room 3261 was leaking and for two nights I thought the puddle from the leak was water that came from the shower or bottled water, but apparently it was the AC that leaked. My bag was wet and smelly. The engineers were quick to respond, but the night after they attended the leaking AC and said it was fixed, I did not have AC. I did not complain to the reception as I thought two complaints per visit was already too much. Prior to this, I also received a delay in check in. I emailed the guest relations prior to my arrival to ask if I will be able to check in early. The answer I got was that I will be able to check in early. Based on this I then adjusted the day's schedule to check in at the hotel first before attending my business meeting. On the day of arrival, I was…"
4,This hotel didn't disappoint.  Well equipped and excellent facilities.  It is definitely in the quieter part of Bali.  Staff excellent and the food at the restaurants in the resort great.  The day spa out of this world
5,"We spent a week here in March 2017 and staying in a club room. The east village is reserved for club members and has its own pool just for east wing guests. The breakfast in the club lounge each morning was great with enough variety to keep us happy. We had different eggs each morning ranging from fried to poached, omelettes to eggs benedict. If you don't see something, just ask. The hotel is starting to show its age a little and doesn't have the polish and modern décor of other Nusa Dua hotels like the Mulia or the Leguna. That said, it was very clean and we felt comfortable walking around the hotel in comfortable clothes without wearing only high fashion labels which we noticed in these other hotels. While every staff member was super friendly and helpful, Urip Ariawan,…"
5,"First resort style location we have stayed at in Bali, in its own gated area. Great grounds and great service. Get out and explore the immediate areas to still be able to experience mall or market style food and shopping experiences. We travelled to Kuta and Seminyak several times via metred taxi at costs ranging beteeen 10 to 13 Australian dollars each way. Best of both worlds."

2,"Beautiful  gardens Clean rooms Great beach, nice and clean Ridiculously priced food and drink ($9AU for water!)  Okay buffet (very limited fruit selection!)  Pool service was terrible  No swim up bar No beachfront restaurants Kids club for over 3s only The slide was fun when operational (under maintenance for first three days) Room service for ice took three phone calls and over an hour and a half. Limited music at night (short roving only)  Isolated location, great if you want to avoid the crowds. I would not return, sorry!   "
5,Excellent hotel in a wonderful location next to a beautiful beach. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food in the club in the evening was exciting and varied. We will definitely be returning.
5,"I have been there for a week with my husband and colleagues. We had perfect time mainly spent at the beach. One could also always find the place near the pool. There are several restaurants located all around the resort so we needed a map all the time. If the rain suddenly starts the umbrella can be easily found, there are umbrella boxes all around. Room was spacious, the terrace was just next to the small artificial lake. Rooms were regularly cleaned and we had no problems. Breakfast: you can find the continental/European food. Dinner: domestic food only, mainly spiced. We used to it after few days. There is a bank branch so you can exchange your money. The shopping mall is very close to the hotel and you can buy all souvenirs there, prices were not high."
3,"First, I must stated that I have stayed in ""Grand Hyatt"" Hotel over 8 different countries.  I would like to think that I know a thing or two about the Hyatt hotel standard and Hyatt expectation.   First, I am very sad to give Grand Hyatt Bali an average rating because honestly, the staff in this hotel deserve a 5 stars rating. They are as Grand Hyatt as it can be in terms of guest service.   However, the hardware of this hotel is really questionable. All my below comments are not related to the cleanliness of this hotel.   Lobby: the lobby of Grand Hyatt Bali was very Baliness and only open areas. The problem is that travellers from colder countries might prefer to have an option of staying in an air-conditioned area when waiting to be check-in. Aslo the lobby might need an…"
4,"Pros:  Lovely grounds, super comfy beds, clean, a wonderful spa, this property is what you would expect from a 5 star property in North America.  If you want a relaxing holiday that feels like home - this is the place.  Cons:  You are in a gated community, with only a small mall within walking distance.  After having travelled all over Bali, this hotel creates a Bali ""light"" experience.  They don't feature much Indonesian food, which is some of the best I've ever tasted.  The band plays classic rock tunes at the bar.  You could be in any really hot country with palm trees and a beach - and that is a pity because Bali is a special place."

4,"Lovely hotel, beautiful views. Great for families, wouldn't even need to leave hotel. Next door is Bali collection and 5 minutes walk to bars, restaurants and shopping districts. Pools were incredible and not crowded at all."
1,"Decided to have our honeymoon here for 10 nightsin Jan 17! What a big mistake we made. Service was poor, our room had mould on the walls and  the resort was under staffed. The best thing we will never forget was what they did for us since we were on our honeymoon! Absolutely nothing!!!! Not even a bunch of flowers for my wife. We will never return 😤"
4,"Hotel is luxury but the price was lower than other equivalent resorts. It was quite cost effective. We loved their swimming pools and the water slider. They also had a hot Jacuzzi, which was very relaxing. The hotel was right across Bali Connection so it was quite convenient to go to grocery shopping. The site is huge but it was very well maintained. It was fun to explore inside the hotel. The only downside were there was no buggy service to move around on site."
5,"We stayed for 2 weeks in a club room. I can't fault the Hyatt. It's beautiful, lovely rooms, great staff, high standards of service, excellent food in the club both at breakfast and happy hour. Unusually for Asia, the bed was extremely comfortable - not nearly as hard as some can be. The perfect way to spend a holiday in paradise."
4,"Food is good, reasonable price, beautiful beach, worth to stay for couple as well as family. Hotel is quite big, it is also good to take a walk around hotel while we don't have any plan. For this reason, I kind of like it. "

5,"Grand Hyatt is located in Nusa Dua area of Bali.  Its gardens are well maintained and it comes with easy access to beach. It has plenty of ponds with beautiful Lotus flowers blooming every evening. I saw staff spending lot of time in maintaining the garden.  Ambience at the entrance to the hotel is nice. Location in Nusa Dua, Bali itself is great as the location comes with good security and well maintained roads.  A shopping area -Bali collections is just few minutes walking distance and one can get a taste of what to pick up in Bali here.  Being east facing location, one can enjoy early morning Sunrise at the beach adjoining this hotel.  Overall -it is a fantastic place to stay in Bali."
5,"What a fabulous time we had.  There are so many pools to choose from and the beach laps the hotel.  Very well kept, beautiful rooms and amazing service.  Good location with shops across the road.  Spa was incredible. We had a great time and will be back."
5,"We found this resort as a package on Luxury escape for 8 nights. Breakfast, nightly cocktails, massage and a few dinners included. This place is specious, you can get lost in it. We spent most of our days relaxing by the pool or the beach (hotel has own access to beach front). Meals were delicious, staff attentive and remembers your name. Kriya spa is amazing and definitely worth a visit. Will be back ! Well done guys."
3,"we stayed in a club room and it was poor value. the only benefit was in having breakfast included. the service was not good - orders were often forgotten, mixed up or late in coming especially at breakfast. drinks in the evening were poor with local wines which were also of poor quality. however, the gardens were spectacular and immaculate. the club pool area was full of screaming children which made it unpleasant. there should be an adults only pool. the club room we had also had no views and lacked privacy as it was overlooked by passers by. the bathroom was dangerous as when the floor was wet, it became as slippery as glass. housekeeping was also ""not up to scratch"". all in all not a five star experience."
5,They have a large room but a bit dated somehow this hotel lobby welcoming you with a very dramatic scenery which is make me feel more falling in love with this hotel and I absolutely will coming back.

The exceptional staff make you feel like family. They always greet you with a smile and seem genuinely happy to do whatever possible to please their guests.   We stayed in the Grand Club and enjoyed the extra amenities. The Grand Club serves cooked-to-order specialties for Breakfast and Happy Hour, that vary each day. In addition, they have a cold bar of plated appetizers and desserts, which were substantial enough for a meal, but save room for the great Balinese cuisine.  We really love the Grand Club - it is open air teak furnishings around a pond and gardens and it is a very peaceful…"

2,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 5 nights during our 9-night trip to Bali on our honeymoon. We stayed in a small suite with a small patio. The room/accommodations were average. I would not pay the posted rate for this room. We needed sheets to be changed upon arrival (seemed like a little blood was on the sheets) and the room was worn, dark, and damp. However, the bathroom was lovely, and the room was well serviced after the initial incident. The hotel provided a complimentary welcome gift for our honeymoon (a massage oil and bath salts) - very kind!  Highlights of the property: -Live music in the bar in the evening. The live music was exceptional. I wish it had gone on all night. It was very relaxing being the lounge/bar area (off of the lobby) with the gentle night breeze and…"
4,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with family and friends. Booked 4 rooms. We were given 2 rooms on one floor and another 2 in another floor. Try to intimate them in advance if you need rooms together . We took the non ocean view rooms, and these were in a kind of 3 storey aprtment block. The hotel has many such blocks and had a vast property size. It had many restaurants of different cusines. There was a small outdoor playground for kids. The rooms were good and and big enough to accomodate 4 people. The views were good and our room was facing one of the restaurants. No complaints about the service as well, however my 4 star rating is only due to the fact that we found the hotel quite commercial and no personal touch.

3,"We stayed here for 8 nights with Luxury Escapes package. The area and gardens are great, but not the service. Our room was attended once a day, so if we had some coffee at lunch time, the cups will remain dirty till the next day. I can wash them, but it's not 5 star service. In other 5 star hotels in Bali they attend room twice a day, prepared bed for night and much more. 4 times out of our 8 night stay I had to go to gest services to ask for shampoo and conditioner, because they didn't put any in my bathroom. Every time the apologised and fixed the problem, but next day it was the same problem.

Room was lovely and spacious with a private balcony overlooking to the beach, even though it was a bit outdated but very well maintained with all the facilities you would need for a perfect stay. Service was outstanding and every staffs we met during the stay were very kind and hospitable. We had meals at all the outlets which were good as well, very reasonable price and good quality.

2,First of all the room was excellent however that's where excellent finished and average began. As a 5 star hotel they have much to improve on.  At the Salsa Verde restaurant we had to stand out in the rain and queue up for a breakfast table -this not in my opinion what should happen in a 5 star hotel. Staff at breakfast were very slow and typically would bring tea (after 10 minutes) but forget to bring the teaspoon and sugar! At the Garden Club restaurant the staff were even slower - ordered a drink and waited 15 minutes! We discovered that when we ordered a cocktail drink it would be made different each time we ordered - different in different restaurants and different even in the same restaurant. Reception staff did not seem to be quite aware what was going on. For example we…
3,The Hotel situated in the Nusa Dua district of Bali. You will be totally wowed by the gardens and the location of the hotel The hotel in general looks stunning from the outside but when you look closely at the fixtures and fittings then the cracks ( literally) start to show. We stayed in a Grand Clud deluxe room. Nothing very deluxe about it for the price. Food and drink over priced. 
5,We have been to the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua many times. The staff are wonderful. The immaculately manicured grounds always leaves us impressed. The rooms are large and comfortable. We love the beach and pool proximity to each other so it is easy to take a dip to cool off after getting too much sun. We cannot wait to return.

Reception staff did not seem to be quite aware what was going on. For example we…
3,The Hotel situated in the Nusa Dua district of Bali. You will be totally wowed by the gardens and the location of the hotel The hotel in general looks stunning from the outside but when you look closely at the fixtures and fittings then the cracks ( literally) start to show. We stayed in a Grand Clud deluxe room. Nothing very deluxe about it for the price. Food and drink over priced. 
5,We have been to the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua many times. The staff are wonderful. The immaculately manicured grounds always leaves us impressed. The rooms are large and comfortable. We love the beach and pool proximity to each other so it is easy to take a dip to cool off after getting too much sun. We cannot wait to return.
5,"A truly 5 star beach resort hotel with luxurious facilities. The landscaped gardens are exquisite, as are the multiple swimming pools. The food is good and restaurants are willing to adjust dishes to your taste. The beach is well tendered and manicured, and peddlers are kept to a minimum. Really tempting to spend time in the hotel rather than exploring Bali's numerous sights and sounds."
4,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 9 nights, and we have broken down our stay into pros and cons listed below. We have also outlined some tips if you are staying at the hotel.   Pros   Service – Undoubtedly, one of the biggest positives from the trip was the level of service we received from the staff. They were accommodating, respectful and cooperative. At breakfast, Mundita Adi was a great host. Please pass on our thanks.   Beach – Whilst the other hotels in the complex also have nice beaches, it is fair to say that the Grand Hyatt has the best access to a very scenic spot on the beach.   Fitness Centre – Wide selection of free weights and cardio equipment.   Gardens – The hotel is extremely big and has some beautiful gardens to walk around.   Breakfast – Good…"
1,"We recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua for 8 nights as a ‘couples’ holiday to recharge the batteries from a busy life (kids and work). We chose the Grand Hyatt based on a promotion by Luxury Escapes, however they do themselves a significant dis-service as this hotel is far from luxury and far from ‘grand’.  We arrived at the hotel at 2:30pm and our room was not ready to check into. They provided us a hotel telephone and suggested we have a wander around and they would call us in about 2 hours, when our room was ready. The hotel knew of our arrival time and this is just not good enough. I asked if there was a bar area we could sit at but was told there were no bars open. We went for a wander around the hotel grounds and found a bar area near the pool with some shade.…"
5,"Excellent service, decent rooms, beautiful landscape. Its a large hotel with over 600 rooms.Good food. Options for all cuisine. Ample activities to do within the premise. Recommended to go with kids also."
5,"We came during February for 8 days. The hotel is A1 and the service and friendly approach of the staff was exceptional. Nothing was too much for them. The rooms are really looked after and clean. The food was also very good. If you would love a break where you are pampered, The Grand Hyatt is the place."

5,"The photos do not adequately communicate just what an amazing property this is. The landscaping is unlike anything we have seen, and the gracious hospitality of the Balinese people comes through loud and clear.  It is an older building, but well maintained, and the rooms have a unique charm. It is a huge property, covers a great deal of land."
4,"Dear Mr Rajebhosale We stayed 10 nights st Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua Bali.  The gardens are heavenly and immaculately kept.  We would like to express our appreciation for the outstanding service provided by Dewi, Toya and Yumi ( Garden Cafe - Breakfast ) during our stay. We were amazed at the consistency in their performance and willingness to go over the  beyond. Attention to details are exceptional for example on our 3rd day they remembered what my husband, my son and myself drink in the mornings even though it was so busy and chaotic during breakfast  with chinese tourists. The housekeeping by Sudiasih was exceptional. We had beautiful frangipani flowers left on our pillows when we returned to our room after a day out it was such a beautiful touch! Most of all I spoke to Sudiasih…"
5,"I went to Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua with a 4 month old baby, 3.5 year old pre-schooler and my sister and let me just say, the resort has something for everyone.  My sister went surfing, my kid went to kids club (the kids club teachers are super professional and lovely) and my husband had time to read by the beach. We really loved the facilities! The private beach and their huge pools with slides are really one of their best features.   While there aren't many negatives, some of them are: 1) the hotel is old but that's ok. It is very well maintained 2) the directional signage is poor and because the hotel is HUGE I often spent 15 minutes wandering around from the lobby to my room lost.   I loved that the room was huge! Apart from the normal king bed they had a separate day bed which…"
5,"Staying at Grand Hyatt Bali was really a magnificent and unforgettable journey. We love the beach and beautiful Indian Ocean accompanied with the huge garden-like resort plants. The resort is so well-designed that taking a walk inside felt like surrounded by tropical forests and gardens. It is a natural place where we saw lots of different animals and plants. Our suite room is big and wonderful to host our vacation. Its facilities and conditions are pretty good. We love these white ducks downstairs wandering in the garden :).  I would like to give special thanks to all the staff in the resort. They are courtesy and helpful. Especially, the staff in the club: Fairuz, Urip, the tall guy, etc.  Moreover, thanks to Deny who welcomed us greatly on arrival and during the stay.  I…"
4,"The resort looks old and in need of maintenance. It is enjoyable never the less. The rooms were large, water bodies outside the room, free WiFi, Tea coffee machine in room. Comfortable beds, Air-conditioner in room 3139 that I stayed was completely ineffective. There were no in room controls for AC either. Breakfast spread was good. The private beech was well maintained and enjoyable. The swimming pool was good. There are shops on property but they were expensive. There is excellent shopping mall just across from the hotel. It has lots of dining options as well. The resort is destination in itself. If you want to tour BALI attractions, then they are bit far from property location. UBUD is 90 mins in traffic, Volcano about 140 mins, rest of the temples etc are beyond 90 mins. So…"

4,"The Resort was surrounded with beautiful tropical foliage and surroundings with quick access to less crowded and perfect Nusa Dua beach. The Resort is walking distance to shops, restaurants and theater. Except for our room mildew smell, we would have highly rated this Resort."
4,"Our 8 night stay at Grand Hyatt was extremely relaxing and enjoyable for our family of 5 (3 boys 6 years and under). We travelled on a Luxury Escapes voucher with many food and spa inclusions which made for a really enjoyable experience and a 'excellent' rating for value. At full rack rate I would expect more from rooms and food outlets. Hotel rooms are slightly dated but with quality beds and linens. The grounds, pools, spa and cleanliness made up for that."
5,"This is our tenth or eleventh visit to this resort.  It defies description!!  The resort itself is magnificently laid out, with lagoons, pools, green areas, wonderful vistas, and is directly on the Indian Ocean!  It has been our ""beach holiday resort"" for the last 27 years!  And we will return again.  The staff is wonderfully helpful and respectful.  Prices are reasonable (we caught a bargain on the Hyatt site).  Because of my wife's Diamond status with Hyatt we got upgraded to a beautiful suite with Grand Club privileges (which they normally afford to us, as we are frequent return guests). With this comes complimentary (very fast) internet.  I can't think of one thing that I would change!  It is a wonderfully relaxing escape from the normal humdrum, which makes it even better!!!"
4,It is nicely maintained property. Whenever I came back to this place from an outing - I felt peaceful! The greenery / vegetation on the property - excellent. Enjoyed seeing and hearing birds on the property. The beach was nice and enjoyable. Service was good. Room was nice and spacious. Overall - enjoyed it a lot!

5,"This is one of the older hotels in Nusa Dua in a traditional Balinese style.  I have been lucky enough to see a black crowned night heron clearly in the day and a Javan pond heron as well as lots of little birds and squirrels.  the gardens, ponds and pools are lovely.  Love our room at the end of a building.  No passing traffic and a view of a pool most of the resort never see.  Staff are very helpful and friendly.  the location opposite Bali Collection (restaurants and shops), and close to the local shops too, is very convenient. Wifi is free."
4,"The hotel has stunning gardens and lagoons, the reception is one the most beautiful foyers I've seen overlooking the Lagoon which has the coast in the near distance.  The rooms are a good size though I think the housekeeping could do with going up a notch in terms of actually being 5*, it's not bad or unclean but the finesse isn't quite there. The staff are friendly  but again not quite the 5* I have experienced in other hotels.   Breakfast was very good, especially the freshly made omelettes or any type of egg you wished.   I think I would stay again purely because the actually hotel grounds are so stunning. "
5,"Really enjoyed my stay. Super friendly and helpful staff. Very relaxing Spa experience, well worth a try! Amazing property in the heart of Nusa Dua. Will definitely book the same hotel on my next trip in March. "
5,"We have stayed many times in this hotel. The location is great because it is surrounded by very well kept gardens and infrastructure. Right accross the street is the Bli Collection with good shops and plenty of restaurants.  Rooms are spacious, Breakfast is  wonderful, The gardens are kept in top condition, the total surface area of the hotel grounds is so large that even when fully booked, there is plenty of space around the pools , the restaurants and not to forget the lovely beach."
4,"The resort is huge and sprawling, it is as others have mentioned a bit old, but we think it adds to the charm.  We were in the Club Room area and really enjoyed the club lounge, the staff was very friendly, and always greeted us with a smile.  Whenever a staff meets you they are very friendly and try their best to help.  The hotel is walking distance to Bali Collection where there are quite a few selection of restaurants to choose from.   We enjoyed our relaxing stay here."

4,"The most beautiful gardens, pools and landscaping make for a lovely, tranquil stay. Very nice rooms (could do with a little bit of an update - but comfortable nevertheless) and wonderful staff made for a relaxing and welcoming stay. Great for families - although watch the tiled floors when wet as was extremely slippery and dangerous for toddlers and small children running about - both in the rooms and around the pools."
5,"Returning to this hotel, where we have stayed many times, really was a bit like coming home. We stayed in two club rooms. Initially we were told we were being upgraded to two pool access rooms, and this didn't happen, but the lagoon view rooms we did get were fine. The rooms are looking a little tired, but they are still functional and very clean. The Club lounge has been totally refurbished since our last visit, and all the changes made have been for the better. There are now a couple of chefs on hand to serve food, and cold dishes are kept in refrigerators. This is good from a food safety perspective, and also stops kids / adults from touching food they don't end up taking from the buffet. We were very happy to see some of the older ladies still working at the lounge, who have…"
4,The resort is great. The Kriya spa well being Centre is world class.we had vouchers from Luxury Escapes. The drink prices are ridiculously expensive for not just Bali but also Australian standards. We loved our stay but might try some where else next time with more reasonable drink prices so we can enjoy some drinks around the pool and at dinner without having to worry about an astronomical bill at check out.
5,"This is what I call a Grand Resort! Huge and beautiful gardens, amazing pieces of art, courteous staff. Everything is well appointed and luxury. We have been here for a couple of days and it turned out to be our most pleasant stay ever at a hotel in Bali."

4,We have stayed here for 4 nights after getting married in Mauritius.  The hotel has beautiful gardens and the staff are very friendly and helpful. I would particularly like to mention Dewi in the garden cafe who went out of her way to provide an excellent service.  Food and drinks are quite expensive at the hotel however there are lots or restaurants at the nearby Bali Collection.  The hotel only had a very small bar area it lacks a bar area with atmosphere.  Although the hotel is good areas of it are bit tired and in need of redecoration. Thr hotel is very big and has lots of different areas but there isn't enough information about the different facilities. You are given a small map on arrival and the details in reception are limited.  We have had a lovely holiday but not sure…
4,"We stayed here for 8 days which was booked through luxury escapes. Luxury Escapes don't actually handle the booking and you have to arrange the date with the hotel itself. We had a lagoon view which was on the ground floor. The bed was huge..literally..however the room decor was a bit jaded and not what I had expected from a Grand Hyatt resort. There are many good restaurants on the complex, especially the Japanese. The Balinese dinner with the local heritage dance/ play was great. The beach is a red flag, so you need to be careful bathing and there didn't seem to be any life gaurd on duty. The beach itself was clean and it was apparent that they went over it with some sort of tractor every morning. There are a lot of families with kids, but there is plenty of space for everyone…"
5,"Assume staff and facilities. Rooms are beautiful didn't think much of food at restaurant. The staff are so lovely and welcoming, helpful and kind. Where  is one of the few hotels right on the beach with direct beach access where you can sip on cocktails and watch the ocean and get sun."
5,we had 8 nights here jan 16 booked with luxury escapes the resort itself is 24 years old and big the staff are excellent and very friendly the gardens are well maintained the pool areas are great and buffet breakfast plenty of choice very relaxing but if you want bali street markets its about 15 min walk or cheap uber. we ate at all the resturants at the resorts and all very good and great service . clean beach  we would stay again .japanese resturant was a lot of fun and great food .

5,"Our family of 4 (4 and 4 years old) stayed here with the Luxury Escapes deal for 8 nights. This place was excellent for the kids. We must have stayed during the very quiet season (7th - 15th Dec) as there were not many other guests. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the buffet breakfast was great (although after 8 days, we were a little tired of it). We basically spend all our time in Bali in the pools and the waterslide, kids didn't want to do anything else but swim all day. Mostly ate lunch and dinner in the resort, prices were comparable back home (Australia). We did venture out across the road to Bali Collection (10mins walk) for a little shopping and food as well.  We stayed in the standard family room overlooking the Bali feature pool in the North Village. We were…"
3,"We had high expectations after many of our friends recommended the Hyatt. We were disappointed with the service more than anything. We live in Asia and have been many places and the service here was near the bottom. Waiters and waitresses didn't have any sense of urgency, the concierge wouldn't give us any recommendations outside of the hotel to eat, and the drinks were terrible even though you were paying over $10.  The other disappointing part was the breakfast buffet. We were at a JW Marriott the week before and this felt like Holiday Inn compared to that.  The other thing was all the area around the pools was very slippery. Our kids slipped and fell multiple times and I saw many others fall. The rest of our trip was nice but definitely some opportunities."
4,"Overall, we thought the hotel was great, the staff friendly, the beach very nice and clean, the grounds, pools, gardens, etc. were very well-kept. The beds were a little hard, but we're used to that in Asia. Our biggest surprise was the mediocre quality of the food. (For example, the orange juice at breakfast seemed like HiC, Tang, or Tropicana instead of fresh squeezed.) Although the wait staff was friendly and prompt, it took a long time to get our food every time: one dinner, one lunch and two breakfasts. One breakfast we actually timed just over 30 mins from ordering to receiving our food. There is a mall about a 15 min walk off campus that we ate at for several meals. Earliest breakfast you can get there is 9:00 am. Otherwise, this is a great location. Expect to see many…"
5,"Recommended for a quiet relaxing break, beautiful property well suited to kids (waterslide, playground and space).   Good room designs and friendly staff. Great beach for surf and swimming. Breakfast fairly busy as you should expect but you just go with the flow and everyone gets looked after. "
2,"We visited this resort 12 months ago on a family holiday with our two sons.  We overlooked the outdated decor in the rooms & spent 8 wonderful, easy days here.  This year, however, the staff within resort seems to be struggling with communication & care factor.  We arrived after a long day with our children & were escorted to our room which absolutely reeked of mould.  The smell was so overpowering that we had to open the door to let fresh air in.  I told the young man that I wanted to change rooms as I was unhappy & wouldn't be comfortable.  He disappeared & never came back! We waited over an hour in that room.  We had to actually go back to the lobby & they finally agreed to change our room after telling us that they were fully booked!  That evening, in our new room, we were…"

The staff were very friendly and helpful, the buffet breakfast was great (although after 8 days, we were a little tired of it). We basically spend all our time in Bali in the pools and the waterslide, kids didn't want to do anything else but swim all day. Mostly ate lunch and dinner in the resort, prices were comparable back home (Australia). We did venture out across the road to Bali Collection (10mins walk) for a little shopping and food as well.  We stayed in the standard family room overlooking the Bali feature pool in the North Village. We were…"
3,"We had high expectations after many of our friends recommended the Hyatt. We were disappointed with the service more than anything. We live in Asia and have been many places and the service here was near the bottom. Waiters and waitresses didn't have any sense of urgency, the concierge wouldn't give us any recommendations outside of the hotel to eat, and the drinks were terrible even though you were paying over $10.  The other disappointing part was the breakfast buffet. We were at a JW Marriott the week before and this felt like Holiday Inn compared to that.  The other thing was all the area around the pools was very slippery. Our kids slipped and fell multiple times and I saw many others fall. The rest of our trip was nice but definitely some opportunities."
4,"Overall, we thought the hotel was great, the staff friendly, the beach very nice and clean, the grounds, pools, gardens, etc. were very well-kept. The beds were a little hard, but we're used to that in Asia. Our biggest surprise was the mediocre quality of the food. (For example, the orange juice at breakfast seemed like HiC, Tang, or Tropicana instead of fresh squeezed.) Although the wait staff was friendly and prompt, it took a long time to get our food every time: one dinner, one lunch and two breakfasts. One breakfast we actually timed just over 30 mins from ordering to receiving our food. There is a mall about a 15 min walk off campus that we ate at for several meals. Earliest breakfast you can get there is 9:00 am. Otherwise, this is a great location. Expect to see many…"
5,"Recommended for a quiet relaxing break, beautiful property well suited to kids (waterslide, playground and space).   Good room designs and friendly staff. Great beach for surf and swimming. Breakfast fairly busy as you should expect but you just go with the flow and everyone gets looked after. "
2,"We visited this resort 12 months ago on a family holiday with our two sons.  We overlooked the outdated decor in the rooms & spent 8 wonderful, easy days here.  This year, however, the staff within resort seems to be struggling with communication & care factor.  We arrived after a long day with our children & were escorted to our room which absolutely reeked of mould.  The smell was so overpowering that we had to open the door to let fresh air in.  I told the young man that I wanted to change rooms as I was unhappy & wouldn't be comfortable.  He disappeared & never came back! We waited over an hour in that room.  We had to actually go back to the lobby & they finally agreed to change our room after telling us that they were fully booked!  That evening, in our new room, we were…"
5,This place is built in Paradise in Earth...  With the excellent view of Beach Front.  Their pool setup will please you.  Their suits are top luxurious. Food selection and cocktail menu are great.  Even if you are paying a great some.  You will never regret it. 
1,at grand hyatt bali no service all old staff do not move also  sad food for indian no clean at pool side zero service there also   too many rules for luxury resort like grand hyatt.  it's 25 years old sad hotel
5,"We recently enjoyed 10 days via Luxury escapes in the Grand Hyatt Bali.  We had a lovely relaxing time in this beautiful resort.  The website does not do this place justice, it is much more magical, with tranquil gardens and water features all perfectly designed and maintained.  Staff were beautiful and gently attentive.  The food and drinks were of excellent quality and quantity, delivered in superb locations, with magnificent views."
5,Very nice hotel.  Beautiful grounds and very peaceful.  Staff was very responsive and helpful.  Transportation from airport was very easy.  Brunch was very good at restaurant near pool/beach.  Rooms were spacious and very nice.
4,Went here with kids who enjoyed it and had the time of their lives. Waves of the beach are perfect for 8 year olds. Really enjoyed the surfing lessons. Apart from that the swimming pool and the waterslides are a very cool attraction which will keep any kids busy. Main downside of this place is that the restaurants of bad quality food. Went to the Japanese restaurant which was a mistake and tried different options on the lunch menu of which all of them were not good. Luckily across from the Hyatt there is small shopping mall with several good restaurants for dinner.

1,"I’am a Diamond number in Hyatt. I reserved a room in Grand Hyatt bali from 01/19/2017 to 01/23/2017 to celebrate my 10th wedding anniversary but unbelievably it turned out as very bad experience. I am also the members of Hilton diamond and SPG platinum. I regarded hyatt diamond should have provided much supreme service than the two others. But the fact is disappointing, and I regretted that I had chosen Hyatt this time.  1.  Saturday,Jan 21, at around 17:30, it thunder rained suddenly,and my kids got wet at the hotel beach. We rushed back to our room, and hoped to give kids a good warm bath, but the water in our room (water from the shower, tub and  basins)was all dirty and yellow (pix taken as attached). Kids even asked me why it's wee bath . We tried to call the concierge…"
3,"Food is very average though prices would indicate it is of very high quality.  Off site, food was much better & a lot cheaper.   Drinks are expensive everywhere, however, seriously, it was almost 193600 IDR for a Jack Daniels which is almost $20 AUD.  This includes tax & service charges.  A Bintang 82280IDR  including tax & service even a soda water before any charges is 48000, almost $5 AUD.   I certainly expect to pay more, but I just feel it's over the top a bit.   On a good note the staff are very friendly & always willing to assist.   "
5,"Hyatt was an experience I will. Never forget. Great location, clean beautiful beaches and the service was outstanding. I am definitely coming back to stay! I was treated like a queen and felt very welcomed. The facilities were modern and clean and it has everything to offer and more. The Japanese rest was the best one I've ever been to. Sensational. "
5,"We stayed here as part of a Luxury Escapes package. The staff were excellent in all aspects be it serving meals, drinks, attending to rooms or any of the facilities. The resort is modern and right on the beach with plenty of shade/sun to choose from. There is a wide variety of restaurants with the Japanese Teppanyaki our favourite."
5,"This hotel & resort is amazing! We were very impressed with everything from the friendliness of the staff, to the amazing grounds & pools and also the top quality restaurants on site! The rooms were quite large and clean even they were slightly dated. The pool area is huge and the waterslide was a big hit with the kids and even the adults. The immaculate hotel grounds seemed to go on forever. It was great exploring new areas of the resort each day. The property is located right on the beach and is only a short walk to a supermarket and outdoor shopping centre down the street. Would love to stay here again in the future!"

5,This hotel is located at beach so you can access sea directly and  has many pools so you can enjoy yourself and your family as well. This hotel food is very delicious and fresh so you can not wait to have meal and garden is very very nice so you don't need go out.
5,There are not enough stars for the rating.  We booked our holiday through a luxury escapes deal and it's amazing value!!!  Thanks Livinia for the recommendation.  The resort has exceeded our expectations and the staff are so friendly and always smiling and polite.   The restaurant food and service has been exceptional - the same quality as a Melbourne exclusive restaurant minus the price tag.   We are here for another 6 days and my boys are already talking about coming back next year.
5,"My husband and I visited the Grand Hyatt for 8 days and absolutely loved it.  The staff were excellent and couldn't do enough for you.  Whilst it may be a little expensive with regards to food and cocktails, Bali Collection, a very large shopping centre is directly across the road with much to choose from.  The rooms were very comfortable and staff very generous with bottled water and towels.  All in all I highly recommend The Grand Hyatt - beautiful grounds, beautiful people!"
4,"Resort has so much to offer, 5 pools, 5 bar/restaurants, tennis, great gym and spa ( exceptional ), massive land area giving space where ever you lay, fantastic beach front, surf spots. Great family holiday."
4,"Beautiful grounds, wonderful service and ok rooms. We didn't spend much time in the room and almost our entire stay in Bali was at this hotel.  Ate a late morning buffet breakfast each day then no need for lunch. Dinners were definitely romantic.  The vacation was expensive and maybe the rooms weren't the most modern but will remember the experience at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua part of Bali."

5,"My first visit to Nusa Dua, normally stay Seminyak side. It was amazing the difference in the beaches and how calm life is. The Grand Hyatt is spacious, scenic with many things to do and places to eat. With the Bali Collective across the road - shopping and restaurants are on your doorstep. It is family friendly although absolutely great for couples as well."
2,From waiting for 20mins on arrival to waiting 30mins to check-out! The terrible room location close to car park that plays out siren noises and speaker-phone instructions at 7am in the morning! The terrible WIFI connection pretty much everywhere except the lobby area! The poor breakfast selection - it was more 3-4* than 5*. The lack of cleaning of the pools with plant and leaf debris everywhere to ant nests close to the sunbeds! Upon check-out I called the bell boy services and no one even turned up to collect our bags so we dragged them with us to the reception! The bathrooms are full of grime and have definitely not been cleaned properly! I wipe the side of the bath tub with a clean towel and it was completely black and brown!!  The wait for a taxi is ridiculous after which I…
2,Out dated and in urgent need of renovation. Terrible tired old rooms. Not a Hyatt resort and should be branded 3.5 star. Slow service and overpriced food and drinks. The buffet breakfast is limited with no consistency day to day while the buffet is heavily catered for the market
3,We spent 6 nights at Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua and were rather unimpressed to say the least. We had arrived from a hotel in seminyak and the Hyatt would be classified as a major downgrade.  We were required to change rooms twice as the air conditioning in the first room didn't work properly and the second room we encountered an over powering paint smell emanating from the air conditioning. It was very frustrating moving twice with 2 young children. Rooms were very outdated and in need of a refurbishment. I expected more from a Hyatt. The rooms were not spotlessly clean as you would expect from a 5 star resort however the grounds are lovely and very well maintained.  You need to pay for kids club which is $. Most of the other resorts offer free kids club services.  The water slide…
3,"This was our first holiday to Bali and whilst we did not like Bali itself we found this area (A gated community of hotels, restaurants and activities) very relaxing and enjoyable. One of the greatest assets to the Hyatt is its location, it's one of the first hotels after the security checkpoint, handy if you wish to venture out and see the real Bali. More importantly the Hyatt is across the road from Bali collection.   We loved Bali collection and ate their most nights, dinner their was around 40% cheaper than the Hyatt. The grounds of the Hyatt were immaculate and very tropical. It was obvious how much work had gone into the design of the resort, surrounding the pools were Kalachuchi Blossoms which drop white flowers into the pools...great idea, additionally these trees provide…"

5,"A nice relaxing holiday in Bali.  I enjoyed the hotel and its expansive beautiful grounds.  The koi ponds were nice and our kids liked feeding the fish.  The playground on the breach was nice.  Our kids enjoyed the kids club, which you had to pay for, but quite good activities and they fed the kids as well. The night Balinese show and outdoor Bali buffet was really good, the children loved the show. Breakfast was quite nice. The spa was fantastic and very relaxing. A nice holiday, may return."
5,"My wife and I enjoyed some amazing days at Grand hyatt Bali Nusa Dua. The best was the attention that we received at Salsa Verde Restaurant , where a trainee  named Trisnawati was the most proffessional, kindly and attentive person who served to us. We strongly recomienda the place and that proffessional people working there, like Trisnawati, a person who is always Willing to do her Best. """
5,"After arriving to a room that smelled a little of mildew, the staff were more than happy to change our room for us (in fact they upgraded us!). This hotel has stunning gardens, soooo many pools, great location, and is one of the best hotels for staff service I have ever come across. The location is as close as you can get to Bali Collection shopping precinct, which is great for delicious, great value-for-money food. One tip ... try to stay in the Ocean View rooms in the north village if possible, unless you are splurging on a villa. Did I mention how good the staff were? Honestly, anyone who hasn't enjoyed this hotel hasn't tried hard enough!!!"
5,"We stayed at this resort through a Luxury Escapes Package and we were not disappointed. Smooth check in - with cold towel and cool drink A massive King Room - with separate bathroom, dressing room and toilet and a private balcony overlooking a private lagoon. Firstly Great Staff. Great Pools, Great Grounds, Good Restaurants and next door to Bali Collection. It really is a 5star resort."
5,"My family of five loved this hotel. We took the Club option which gave us access to the lounge for beverages, snacks and what turned out to be a nice breakfast and dinner even though they term the latter ""canapés"" you really didn't need more. The lay out of the huge pool complex is great and we found we could easily get our own secluded little rock pool shaded by trees to enjoy. We got to the water slide at 9.00 and enjoyed it to ourselves for almost an hour before anyone else joined us. The staff said the hotel was at capacity but the way it is split into villages and the pool is stretched into canals of landscaped rock pools it was hard to believe. It never seemed to be crowded. We loved this resort and will go back. The only minor comment was that the piped music from the…"

4,We have spent 8 wonderful days the the GH Bali. The grounds are stunning and beautifully maintained.  The rooms and service are what let this hotel down and we have not received the typical service we expect when staying at a Hyatt property.   Our children love the waterslide and we all enjoyed the water exercise class each day. Pool staff were not overly friendly and we were never offered a drink or food rather had to approach staff if we wanted anything. We are used to staying at similar properties and we surprise that no complimentary drinking water is supplied at the pool (or at any eatery on the property). Bottled water is over $4++ at the pool which seems excessive. 5 star touches like towels not being laid out on sunbeds etc were also missing.  We enjoyed our time at the…
5,"We stayed for 10 nights in early January 2017 and loved the serenity, beauty and layout of and the general amenities provided within the whole Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua facility. The staff were all very professional, curteous and welcoming. The room service was faultless. The Latin American 3 piece combo at the facility's main bar, was a nightly highlight. The private pool immediately outside our room was a haven. Unfortunately, the standard/quality of the food (other than of the breakfasts and the champagne brunch which were excellent) in all of the restaurants was disappointing. The presentation and service were fine, but most meats and fish were overcooked and dry and in particular, the tepanyakki meal at the Japanese restaurant was well below par; the beef served was gristly and…"

Perfect hotel for families who want to disconnect with life and just spend quality time with each other."
5,"The hotel is very clean and well maintained, room was large and nicely decorated. Bathroom looked a little dated, though. Breakfast was very good and varied, served in three different locations, of which we preferred the Water Court restaurant with its beautiful outside setting (a big thank you to Alit and her breakfast team!!). Dinner was served in either Salsa Verde or Garden Cafe restaurants - we mostly chose the Garden Cafe, with Balinese food (very happy with the attention and courteousness of staff at dinner, professional and friendly all the way - thank you Ari and team!). We dined at the Salsa Verde restaurant too and were very happy with the exquisite Italian food. The beach was spotless clean, the pool area, too. The entire place is beautiful, with large gardens that…"
4,"Property is sprawling and beautiful, the gardens are amazing. Rooms are nice but need a revamp. Staff are exceptional. Restaurants and menu are ok, in need of an update. Prices are high and it's easier and better to go across the road to the open air shopping centre for food and nightly entertainment. The resort is lovely for families, they charge for everything.... watch out. Water and towels poolside in my opinion should be free as well as children dining with two paying adults."

3,"The Grand Hyatt is a stunning beachfront property in Bali's toney Nusa Dua area. The landscaping is absolutely breathtaking. The pools are gorgeous. The food and service is excellent. Housekeeping is faultless. So now you're probably wondering why I haven't rated them 5 stars. Here's why:   When we booked through Luxury Escapes, GHB confirmed our booking in writing by e-mail but a few days later got back to us and said those dates are unavailable. We had bought non-refundable air tickets and made further travel plans. It took several emails and phone calls to sort the matter out. Not a great start to the vacation.

5,"Were here for 4 nights through NYE; Had a wonderful suite and enjoyed the lush property and professional service; While other hotels in Nusa Dua turned crazy on NYE, the Hyatt was relaxed, with special menues at 3 restaurants and a moderate party in the lobby. "
4,"The location is just perfect near Bali collection where you get f&B, shops, groceries...  Even though the hotel has great swimming pools and gardens, rooms are poor and need a refurbishment. The staff is really awesome and very helpful"
5,"Hi guys, were siting here at the moment gin & tonic in hand , surrounded by a beautiful wetlands garden.  We chose the executive wing to give us a pamper, and the staff have exceeded all expectations, We can't complain about a thing, not that I'm the complaining type.  But when you get exceptional service you must give whole hearted praise.  So do yourself a favour, come to Bali , stay at the Hyatt, you won't be let down. Scott Land of Oz ."
3,"Room size is generous and even if you don't get the ocean view, the scenery is still breathtaking. They take very good care of the outdoors area, well manicured lawn and lily ponds everywhere!   For such an old hotel, I suppose that the rooms are not too shabby but you can see the wear and tear. Our bathtub was cracked, the bathroom blind was broken, the nook looks a bit worn out and need some airing out.  The breakfast is satisfactory although it doesn't change and I guess would get very boring if you stay for more than a weekend.   Beach is rather clean with plenty of chairs to lounge around and perfect view for sunrise. The coconut lawn would be good for sunset viewing.  This hotel is very very far from other attractions, food, cafe, etc."
3,"The Grand Hyatt is a stunning beachfront property in Bali's toney Nusa Dua area. The landscaping is absolutely breathtaking. The pools are gorgeous. The food and service is excellent. Housekeeping is faultless. So now you're probably wondering why I haven't rated them 5 stars. Here's why:   When we booked through Luxury Escapes, GHB confirmed our booking in writing by e-mail but a few days later got back to us and said those dates are unavailable. We had bought non-refundable air tickets and made further travel plans. It took several emails and phone calls to sort the matter out. Not a great start to the vacation.

5,"Once our taxi passes a security check and our bags are searched , we arrive. We're greeted scented leis and a cool drink. The Hyatt is fabulous! They have the most beautiful gardens I’ve ever seen at a resort. Everything has a quiet serene Balinese feel to it, understated and luxurious.   The hotel is situated on the beach .There are a couple of pools an both a hot and cool spa. I love the lagoon pool with its green waters .  Our room is huge with a wonderful and comfortable bed."
5,It's a very spacious and very large hotel. Beautiful stretch of beach and morning jogs and yoga are ideal way to start the day. Very friendly staff. Rooms are very nice. Stayed at the hotel for 3 day event. The food was good. Lots of walking areas but only one mall for shopping and dining outside the hotel.
4,"The location is superb. The rooms are dated and be prepared to walk a long way to pools or beach or reception. The sports club was basic, sauna steam tired finishes and staff keen to sell you classes or courts which should be free"
5,"We spend 9 days in the hotel and our children enjoyed a lot in the pool area and also in the beach. The facilities are really surprising, full of nature and beautiful. And the staff of the Hotel are great, they really take our your holidays."
1,"Had booked 5 nights in the hotel but moved to the Westin after the second one.   We arrived at the hotel 1:45pm and waited  almost 3 hours to get the second room.   We have a 18 month old girl and for my surprise she was not allowed to use the kids club even under supervision.   Does the management expect that kids under 3 bear the whole day in the pool and expose to the sun? Or that they have to be confined in the room?   We asked the staff to the management and the management said there was nothing can do.   After 2 stays, Grand Hyatt never again!   Staff is very friendly though."

5,"We had a family vacation with stay for 5 nights at Grand Hyatt Bali. It was New Year Celebration as well as we arrived at the facility. Location is very good if you want to avoid crowd & noise. Nusa Dua beach is splendid and quiet. Clean. The Bali Collection a shopping area is just a walking distance. The facility is huge. We had a beach front room. The sceneries are beautiful. We availed hotel provided car ( booked for day) and visited other attractions as well including Uluwatu and Kintamari, Ubud and Bedukul area. Will recommend to anyone looking for a family vacation at Bali"
4,"The Grand Hyatt, Bali is a hotel situated well within the safe environment of Nusa Dua.  Large rooms, landscaped gardens, choice of swimming pools and beach frontage. Exceptional Service from Urip, the Club Manager and his wonderfully, friendly team."
4,"We reserved a Club King room. Throughout the years we have stayed at many Hyatt Regency/Grand Clubs around the world, however this was a little bit of a let down. I found that when I came into the lounge during the middle of the day, instead of serving my family and I they were standing around the front desk chatting and laughing. Although, there were a few very attentive and courteous staff members. The breakfast offerings were a little limited, and flies were regularly buzzing around the food, which was a little off-putting. However, the drinks and canapés  were to a high standard. The room was fine, nothing special compared to the Hyatt Regency in Phuket, all with ocean view (incl. the club lounge) and majority with private pools for nearly half the price! Definitely…"
5,"First time stay in Grand Hyatt Bali, has Amazing hotel with sea views, surrounded with trees & nice lotus pools, perfect hotel to spend with family. Unforgettable memories definitely will come back for next vacation. "
4,"We came to the grand Hyatt after 8 nights at the Trans in Seminyak (which cost almost exactly the same), and to be honest, it felt like a bit of a downgrade.  This comes with the caveat that it isn't at all a bad resort, just not in line on many levels with other similarly priced resorts in Bali. It is of course leaps and bounds above anything for the price back in Australia.  Pros: AMAZING pool. I've never been to a resort with a better or more engaging pool. The kids (and we) were happy doing not much more than chilling out in the great pool and slide.  Great location - sitting on a beautiful beach, and beautiful grounds.  Great food. Other than the breakfast that isn't as good as others in Bali (but better than any back in Australia)  Cons: WAY overpriced food and drinks. As…"

3,"My husband, Sister and i stayed here for a week over xmas and new year.  I must say in all the places we have stayed the gardens are the best in bali and its a real credit to the gardeners who look after this property.  This property is sprawling and located opposite the Bali Collection.  We were booked in for a garden view in the club rooms.  My sister had the same sort of room .  We checked in and because we were in the club we were taken to the club lounge to check in where we given a juice and cold towel.  Check in did take some time in comparison with other Hyatts we have stayed at.  We weren't told anything for about a hour and then told our room was ready.  Sitting in a hot area for a hour without any news wasn't that great.  Wouldnt have been hard to come and say…"
4,"This hotel meets all expectations for a family resort in Bali. Beach activities, swimming pools (although please note, there isn't a swimming pool area specially reserved for adults only). Lovely landscaping, great views of the ocean, very restful."
4,"This is a hotel with huge area. The garden is nice, but the lighting is not so good. To dark at night. We were stay as a couple, they provide 1 king size bed, but we can see it just 2 single bed merged into 1 bed. It is no problem when it done properly. The problem is the middle part not covered with additional matrass or whatever. We can feel the middle line and made us feel uncomfortable.  The worst part is the food. Stay for 3 days to nights, we found same foods. Especially the snacks, we found the same for coffee break, breakfast and lunch.   "
2,"Stay away if you are looking for a quiet getaway for just the two of you. The hotel is overrun with parents who do not understand how to, or care to, discipline their children.  The Club is better venue, less crowded. The beach is nice but not amazing and can be filled with 20-something surfers Staff do not enforce any Hyatt-residency requirements."
4,"Located in sprawling lush green gardens, this beautiful property was a real Eden. Squirrels, birds and other tame(ish) wildlife abound and it's difficult not to feed them (event though we're technically not allowed to). Because of its huge size, it can be a bit of a walk to get from the room to the rest of the hotel but it's well worth it. The staff were very helpful in changing our original rooms to other ones closer to the lobby.Our rooms with balcony overlooked a huge pond where lotuses opened in the morning and ducks came to feed every day.  The rooms were very comfortable and very similar to most other 5-star hotels, but it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi, a certain Balinese touch was missing in my opinion. Also, there was no welcome note, nor any fruit during our stay…"

4,We had overall good experience while our stay at Hyatt. While in Bali we stayed both at Kuta and Nusa Dua. Both were different experiences. Kuta was more happening whereas Nusa Dua was calm and peace. At Hyatt overall property is nice and huge but i felt at few places it doesn't leave upto Hyatt's brandname. In bathroom for couple of days we had red water flowing (not sure if it was muddy water) also there was fluctuation of lights where power was cutoff for some time ( this was a surprise for us). Other then that I think it was good experience.
4,Absolutely love the setup... Huge Balinese Slye hotel. Good and friendly staffs as well. We had some minor issues during our stay though it is also in Bali... Balinese time applies in any hotel. We all enjoyed our stay here. 
5,"This property is huge and offers you everything you need for your vacation. It's the type of resort that you don't have to leave during your entire stay, with several pools, direct beach access, several bars and hotels, spa and shops. Highly recommend the spa and Japanese restaurant!"
4,Spent 4 nights at Grand Hyatt. Nice serene place. Staff were friendly. Food was good but highly priced as mentioned. Enjoyed the shopping and food at Bali collection. Rooms could be upgrade to a higher standard.  Breakfast was good.....a wide variety of food to chose from.  
5,The stay at Grand Hyatt was excellent. The location of the Hotel is great right next to the mall.  The resort is huge and our room was actually pretty far from the pool area and the lobby but it was fine since the walk was good for our health.  Overall I would highly recommend it

4,"Grand Hyatt Bali was nice. We stayed here for 4 days and 3 nights. They put us in a giant suite and it was beautifully decorated. Like many other reviewers, you can most certainly tell it's an older hotel- the bathroom fixtures could use a face lift and there are definitely chips and dings in the walls,  but I think the grounds make up for it.  Beautiful lily pads and lotus flowers in lakes and water features all over. The trees provide a lot of natural shade for those on the beach or hanging by the pool.  The staff members were friendly, but you can easily be overlooked because there are so many people at this hotel.  We woke up to a puddle of water on our living room floor one morning. I guess it's common for the air conditioning unit to leak with older buildings? I called the…"
3,"We liked the property but the service was lacking. Restaurant service super slow, barely anything for a gluten free option. The staff was useless with any demand. No manager in sight. Is Grand Hyatt resting on their laurels?"
2,"To many hidden items especially, when booking in USD but finding out on arrival that you cannot use the USD currency due to government reasons. then you get ripped off by hotel telling you that currency exchange is only valid as set by hotel. so you will end up paying thousands more since miraculously    IDR become higher than what they are anywhere in the world. so for every USD you had to pay more IDR than normal."
3,"My hubby, daughter and I decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua for 9 nights over Christmas (18th-27th dec 2016). We stayed in room 3442. I'll start with the positives. The main reason we chose this hotel was because of the waterslide and kids club. We were not disappointed! The waterslide and pool facilities are amazing. The kids club and their staff were also top notch. My daughter was very, very happy.  The bed was very large, comfy (could have been softer), and the pillows were lovely. The woman who serviced our room on most days was also very lovely.  The television station selection was great. There were many options which was wonderful with a child to entertain after too much swimming in the sun. The negatives.... The reception staff and waiters were horrible! On…"

2,"Very difficult to get the basics.  Wanted wine glasses for our room was told I had to BUY them.  FURIOUS!  15 minute walk to reception told that I called room service and they charge but if you call concierge no charge.  To add insult to injury I had in fact called concierge.  Manager argued the point.  The concierge staff were in full view and knew that I had in fact called them but didn't intervene.  It's worth noting all 3 were standing around doing NOTHING.  Manager had the cheek to ask me to wait whilst he sorted it out.  I declined advising that I was returning to my room, a paying guest waits in a 5* hotel while they sort out incompetence...... I think not. Beware you may well find yourself queuing for breakfast at both restaurant most mornings!  Staff in the restaurants…"
5,"The Hyatt is beautiful and such a variety of restaurants within the grounds and connected to shopping and eating spaces easily. The spa experience is sensational, well worth the price. You will feel like you have arrived in heaven "
5,"If you're looking for a beach vacation in Bali, this is what you're looking for! Let me explain. LOCATION: 5*  The hotel is located right on a beautiful stretch of beach in Nusa Dua, next to the Bali Collection mall. Perfect! The drive from/to the airport takes just about 20 minutes. HOTEL GROUNDS: 5*  Stunningly beautiful! The hotel occupies a large piece of prime beachfront land. While the hotel is large, it never feels this way since everything is so spread out, with little ponds, gardens and beautifully landscaped walkways sprinkled in throughout. We woke up every morning commenting on the beauty of the setting. HOTEL LOBBY & BUILDINGS: 5*  The lobby is a large open and welcoming space - makes for a perfect start to your vacation! The lobby bar is also a perfect place to…"
5,We had a fantastic holiday where we were spoilt and treated like kings!!! Will be back The staff were so kind and helpful and the food AMAZING. We are a family of 4 and will never stay anywhere else in Bali - and we have been around. Thanks Grand Hyatt
2,"Venue was the only thing nice while the following things were poor...yellow water in sink, smell coming from shower drain, food was poor compared to expectations and everything was over priced. I'm ok with paying premium price for things especially food however at grand Hyatt Bali they failed. "

5,"Everything was great here. Beaches, food, pool.  Our room was tired and needed maintenance but other than that it was great.  The service was excellent and the gym facilities were top notch.  Good banking facilities on site as well.  The Bali Collection shopping area was very close.  If you want authentic local market and food experience this is not for you but it was great for the little ones.  I felt very safe the whole time.  "
4,"Paid for up grade room but put in room on far end of resort, asked for move but was refused by management. Check before that room is not next to stair well and not near large groups of a Chinese tours, very noisy and rude, no consideration for other guests. Asked through duty manager for possible package for future stays, where told that reservation manage will get back to us (Did not happen). Staff at restaurants, pool and reception are great, and we where treated beautifully. The grounds are beautiful and we'll maintained by dedicated ground staff. Would have considered going back for a third time but disappointed with responses from management."
5,Perfect resort for family vacation with kids.Private beach access and lagoon pool with slide. Excellent staff and food services.Will recommend for family vacation for a week. Hotel is kid friendly. Location is good and water sports.
4,Nice place with lovely pools and beach. Rooms need a refurb - décor is dated and our balcony door was old and hard to move which meant we barely used the balcony. Breakfast is not great either. Bar and restaurant staff can be slow at times.
5,"We just got back from the Grand Hyatt and could not fault it. The service was excellent and the room and facilities amazing. All the staff were so friendly, especially Pari who works at the pool. Our kids loved the water slide at the pool and the beach was beautiful. We can't wait to go back. Thank you for a great holiday. "

Would have considered going back for a third time but disappointed with responses from management."
5,Perfect resort for family vacation with kids.Private beach access and lagoon pool with slide. Excellent staff and food services.Will recommend for family vacation for a week. Hotel is kid friendly. Location is good and water sports.
4,Nice place with lovely pools and beach. Rooms need a refurb - décor is dated and our balcony door was old and hard to move which meant we barely used the balcony. Breakfast is not great either. Bar and restaurant staff can be slow at times.
5,"We just got back from the Grand Hyatt and could not fault it. The service was excellent and the room and facilities amazing. All the staff were so friendly, especially Pari who works at the pool. Our kids loved the water slide at the pool and the beach was beautiful. We can't wait to go back. Thank you for a great holiday. "
5,"We stayed 8 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the property with its great ambience and surroundings. The lobby, lounge areas, Salsa bar etc all have great views. The stretch of beach front is v.long and clean. The beach / lagoon is excellent and you can see different colors during different times. Swimming pool is great especially the slide. Food is good (can improve on veg options maybe). Bali collection is bang opposite so you can have some meals / basic shopping from there. Staff is generally warm and responsive. Rooms are big and well kept."
3,"Upon arrival, slow check in being a Gold Passport Member, room was given too far from the lobby and need to do a room change in the evening. Breakfast spread was bad, and service is poor when breakfast was taken at 10am."
3,"Bali is a good tourist attraction & Grand Hyatt is conveniently located. It is an above average facility. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Except for the breakfast, other facilities are worth the value"
5,"My family love Grand Hyatt Bali so much. We stay here many times. The hotel area are so good, just like a heaven in Nusa Dua Bali. The hotel has a perfect white beach and pools where we always spend good family quality time together, served by very good hotel staffs. Highly recommended for family with kids"
4,Good for families. Better location than Kuta. Bali Collection center has many food and shopping choices. Hotel has a semi-private Beach and overall good facilities with very friendly staff. Would recommend for Families.

4,"Had a great time at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. Greeted with smile and was sent off with a smile too. Hotel seemed to be a little tired but well maintained. Room was well presented and bed was super comfy. Hotel facilities were in good shape and the beach was awesome. Had breakfast and dinner at Garden Cafe and the Italian restaurant and food was adequate. Oh ya, not forgetting that the hotel had the Kecak Dance at one of its restaurants over dinner too. So for those who didnt had time to catch it at Uluwatu, one can just stay at the resort and enjoy Balinese cultural performance right at your doorstep. Only downside was the service by one of the Garden Cafe staff which was may be one of her bad day at work, she was kindda rude to not only us but guests behind us as well. Other than…"
5,"Hyatt in NusaDua was fabulous! Staff attentive, friendly and helpful. Recommended good activities and restaurants but actual hotel and rooms were amazing. Turn down services leave little chocolates for kids but they most of all loved pool with slide"
4,"The resort is huge and the place feels like an Oasis. with ducks, gikos, birds, fish and even squirrels moving around. Very nice for talking pictures fabulous trees and a beautiful private beach. We rent bikes and enjoyed a wonderful ride around the resort and the tennis court.  The breakfast is nice and had a big variety of choices.  The only drawback is the rooms. They really need renovation. the roll up shades were very difficult to control!  and the balcony chairs were worn out and we asked for new ones. The kettle is very small and old.Higher level floors are much better than ground level.  Summary: if you prefer to spend most of your time in activities, shopping and dinning outside, then this place would fit you with the natural views and great location. but if you prefer…"
4,"Not only is the property Grand in size, it also has a Grand Location. It is sandwiched between the beach and Bali Collection, a plaza with Restaurants, Spas and Art Markets. The Hyatt is perfect for those looking to spend a lot of time on the beach. It's also excellent for families with kids as it has excellent pools and facilities for the kids.  A few things they can improve upon: The Staff handling Check in and Check out takes too long. These days almost zero time for check in and check out is the norm but at Hyatt it could be anywhere between 5-15 minutes. The evening cultural program is nice but not worth the 175K minimum fees in local currency charged per person."
3,As regular at Grand Hyatt Singapore I had my expectation on par if not more for the one in Bali only to be disappointed with its services and having lost 2 pairs of Levi's jeans in the hotel room. Would I go back? I don't think so although the facilities and the beach front are top notch. Perhaps try others along the same stretch.

4,Stayed here for three very pleasurable nights ...the resort is  stunning visually but the rooms tend to look a bit dated. That aside we were treated to some amazing hospitality and I must complement the amazing spread laid out in the buffet breakfast . 
5,"Loved the Grand Hyatt Bali at Nusa Dua. Beautiful setting with amazing gardens, themed pools, private beach and wonderful lounges, restaurants, fitness centre and kids club. Large guest rooms that are well appointed. The staff are magnificent and so kind. Genuinely interested in talking with you too, which is refreshing. We bought a Luxury Escapes deal and the inclusions were just amazing. So much value. Saved us about $3500 we estimate!!!"
5,Located on beach and one of the most green property. Have beautiful flora and pools in the property. Good restaurants with multiple food choices. Would recommend this to all kinds of travellers with a decent budget.
5,"Returning to the Grand Hyatt Bali, Nusa Dua and staying Grand Club rooms,  the stay was as usual excellent. The friendly and attentive service has made this hotel our "" home away from home"" and has become a must visit every year."
4,Beautifuli Place that I would recommend to all my friends. Everything above expectations. I have  stayed here many time s since 1994. The Grand Club is fantastic. Hope to come back soon. After the renovation everything is even better.

5,Excellent hotel. Hotel great quality and value for money. Staff are extremely good and extremely obliging Rooms clean and spacious. Excellent facilities and the beach on your doorstep Food great and good value
2,"I was generally disappointed with this Hotel, my first time staying there. I found it quite run down, in need of renovation and generally outdated. It is also a rambling style of layout and not easy to navigate (I found the Hotel ""map"" next to useless). If you were at all infirm, had health issues or found it difficult to get around, this hotel is not for you. The rooms are generous and thoughtfully designed. I had a view of the ocean (room 3403). The Hotel staff, as has consistently been my experience throughout Indonesia, were very polite and attentive. The Hotel provides a ""Corner Store"" for general provisions at a reasonable price which is appreciated by guests staying more than a couple of nights. The swimming pools are good and the location is lovely, right on the beach…"
4,"Stayed here for a weekend of work and one day of relaxing.   Truly lovely location with beautiful grounds, water lily ponds, relaxing walkways and gorgeous views of beach and area.  several pools with winding areas--- fun for swimming, although they get crowded with families mid-day.    I walked all over and really enjoyed, day and night.   at night, some areas are a bit dark and could use more lighting--- esp if you are with someone who can't see/walk well.     checkin and checkout were friendly and efficient.    my room was ground floor with view of some shrubs and a service wall, plus at night, it was very dark and next to long alley that was dark and a creepy.    disappointing---as almost all other rooms had some view of water lily pond or higher up rooms had view of beach. …"

3,"We arrived being totally exhausted after a long flight (and 20 minutes taxi drive from the airport) and experienced staff at reception with no compassion or care. Check in was check in time (14.00 pm) and not an extra step was taken to try to provide us any comfort (even the promise to tell us if the room was ready earlier was not kept). A not nice start of a not nice stay. The rooms are dark (lot’s of wood), very cold airco, bathrooms terrible old fashion and not well maintained. The resort is huge so you have to walk long distances in the warm climate to arrive at reception (not functional while being on business). Serious problems with WIFI reception. Good breakfast and swimming facilities/close to the beach. Check out was a nightmare. Staff did not understand simple…"
3,What we like - private beach - amazing receptionist named Bu Budi who helped us with check in and room selection - nice area for breakfast at salsa verde - great gym and private club house  What we don't like - the fact that they dont use king bed but combining 2 single beds into one big bed and name the room King Size bed is really disappointing - extra charges IDR 50k for heating up baby food - extra charges IDR 50k for borrowing knife to cut apple - extra charges IDR 50k for borrowing hotel's plates and bowls  - extra charges every time we want to request something that usually is FREE at other 5-star hotels - think twice before requesting anything - overpriced spa and massage services in comparison to other 5 star hotels in Nusa Dua - lobby is very hot despite the rainy…
5,"Fourth times stayed in Grand Hyatt Bali. We have arrived hotel in the evening, however they were more than welcome to assist our check-in. Plus they have upgraded our room in Grand Club East Village(Slightly bigger one). It's always good to see they care about their loyalty member. Nusa Dua is a quite place compare to Kuta or Seminyak, however the staffs here were super lovely!! Always smile and very polite during entire stay!. I highly recommend this hotel if you would like to stay in Nusa Dua area. Again, the all staffs here in Grand Hyatt Bali was super awesome!! Hope they will keep this up! :)  Thanks for The Excellent Hospitality.  Dhohirni, Sunaji"
5,"Grand Hyatt Bali lived up to its reputation as a 5 star hotel.  Hotel, grounds, facilities but most of all the staff at Grand Hyatt Baili make it the perfect place to have a romantic, relaxing place.   Grand Hyatt Bali surprised us with a flower arrangement for our 31st wedding anniversary and we had the most romantic Champagne Brunch on our balcony.  Would recommend Grand Club Rooms.  We have recommended the Grand Hyatt Bali  to our family, friends and work colleagues."

4,"Several friends had recently stayed at Grand Hyatt Bali, and raved over this huge resort.   Magnificent tropical setting on the beach. Whilst our room was a little tired and dated, showing its age, the resort ad a whole is magnificent !  Five great restaurants, excellent vanity of food, mostly of high quality.  Japanese restaurant a touch disappointing, particularly if you are on a "" package "", you don't get the best.  A tip... you need to upgrade.   Yes, we will return.    One major attraction is the very large shopping centre opposite the resort.. Bali Collections , with some 30 cafes and restaurants., good food at reasonable prices.   Have a daily foot massage, but you can bargain... very good !"
5,The Grand Hyatt provides a beautifully crafted property with many facilities for adults and children. The extensive meandering series of pools provided fun filled opportunities for both adults and children. This is a very well maintained hotel with an excellent set of service standards. Will return again.
4,"We had a wonderful experience during our stay in the hotel. The room was wonderful, big and spacious. My son enjoyed playing the pool. It had easy access to the beach.  The hotel is located very near to Bali Collection. So we had lot of options for dining including Indian Cuisine. The only challenge we faced was to arrange for our local trips."
5,"Top quality hotel. Very large site but wonderful grounds with exceptional water features. Brilliant, caring staff - nothing is too much trouble. Lovely, well kept  beach. Quality throughout. Several restaurants and bars but all very quiet. Nearby local bars and restaurants - 5 minute walk."
5,"The room very nice, luxury and big. Staff friendly and always smiling they also suggested what things to do in bali. I would say it was an average overall experience. Stayed here 3 nights to attend an event at the hotel."

A Hotel and resort with personal touch. Even new hotels in Bali will really difficult to take my heart away from Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua Bali."
3,"Stayed there for 2 nights with my wife. I would say it was an average overall experience. Mostly due to the physical condition of the hotel itself because it's an old building. So if you're looking for a new hotel, this wouldn't be your choice. The room is clean though and the bed is comfy. It's close to the beach. The restaurant and the breakfast is below average for a 5 star hotel. Probably explain why it's cheaper than other 5 stat hotels nearby. "
2,Stayed here with my wife for 2 nights. Must say its a great property.  The rooms however are a big disappointment. The shower Knob was broken and it took the hotel one complete day to fix it. Could not use the bath tub as there was yellow water flowing down the taps. Ordered Fish n Chips in the room - Horrible !!! Wasn't prepared well. The batter kept falling off from the fish.  Customer service and hospitality is no where close to what you expect to get from a brand like Grand Hyatt.
4,"Stayed here for 2 nights to attend an event at the hotel. The deluxe king room is spacious and the bathroom is huge. The room and the furnitures need to be updated, looks a lil bit old.

We have breakfast, lunch and snacks in the hotel and the pasta is really good. Really enjoy our stay at Grand Hyatt."

I think its one of the biggest hyatt suites that can be obtained with a suite upgrade...the resort is huge I must say very well maintained, not old as some users have described, maybe that is just the standard rooms...breakfast for diamonds was in the club...there were decent options, the club is outdoors near ponds with fish!!...the hotel is near the bali collection..great place for souvenirs and shopping...way cheaper than the hotel"
5,"We come to Bali every year and the Grand Hyatt has certainly been one of our favourite resorts! The service is amazing, the staff couldn't be more accomodating and kind.  The facilities are wonderful. My kids loved the water slides and kids club! Only slight issue is that you have to pay for kids club at this resort, however in saying that it is a 1st class kids club and they program they run is excellent so for us it was well worth it!  We came on a luxury escape package and the inclusions were fantastic! The spa and treatments are amazing!  "
2,"The staff and service are generally what you would expect, friendly and reasonably efficient.  The hotel however has been around for many years and nothing has changed, no updates, no renovation, no refurbishment.  If you are looking for old style bali and happy with old style furniture and sitting outside for all meals you should be fine.  The biggest disappointment for us was that we booked a  Club ocean view King and expected much more based on what other hotels such as Sofitel offer.    Amenities/food - Being a regular guest at Sofitel Nusa Dua, Bangkok etc we assumed this would allow us to eat at either the outdoor club dining area or the (standard) indoor dining restaurant.  Apparently not, the food was rather disappointing the same thing every day, no variety of food for…"
5,"If you are looking for a tranquil resort feel in Bali then this is a great resort for that! It is far away from local attractions and other cities like Ubud and Seminyak however this location in Nusa Dua gives you peace, your own space and amazing personal service and staff.  The hotel is very accomodating as well. We enjoyed our cocktail hours at the Grand Club the most."

The hotel is very accomodating as well. We enjoyed our cocktail hours at the Grand Club the most."
2,Stayed here with my wife for 2 nights. Must say it's a great property. The rooms however are a big disappointment. The shower knob was broken and it took the hotel one complete day to fix it. Could not use the Bath Tub as there was Yellow water flowing down the taps.  Ordered fish and chips in the room - Horrible !!! Wasn't prepared well. The batter kept falling off from the fish.  Customer service and hospitality is no where close to what you expect to get from a brand like Grand Hyatt.  Would definitely not recommend this property to anyone for the price that it demands.
5,"Pros:  Very reasonably priced for what you get.  Excellent club lounge with many hot breakfast and pre-dinner items that a very tasty.  Multiple pools to choose from.  Very friendly staff with a smile on their face at all times.  Really nice and modern gym.   Cons: A bit of a drive to visit the major Bali attractions but I think that's due many to traffic and not distance.  Lots of mosquitos.  Visited with my wife and 9 month old daughter. I think every staff member fell in love with my daughter, they love babies here. As a diamond member they checked us in at the club lounge and escorted us to our room from there. We used one of our suite upgrades. Not sure if they put us in an even better suite or if we were given the standard upgrade suite but it was awesome. Large master…"
5,"Me and my family (4yrs old daughter) stayed at Grand Hyatt Bali for 4 nights; wonderful hotel with amazing gardens, pools, beach, and everything you need to relax! Hotel room was great, staff extremely friendly and obliging, drinks and food excellent. Can only recommend this Hotel :-)"
5,"Loved this resort. The pools, the restaurants, everything is luxury. We went as a family and the kids enjoyed themselves too. Highly recommend getting a second room for children as sharing the small extra bed was not ideal."
5,"Our second trip with the family and it was even better than before. We stayed at the Grand Club where rooms were tucked away privately. It had its own check in / out facilities. I loved the fact that it maintains a very balinese feel to it unlike the more modern hotels. With two kids , the adjoining rooms were great. The space and the layout of the rooms were great. Everyone had their own space. The view overlooked the pond it was beautiful and tranquil.  Breakfast and early evening drinks and food were served at the Grand Club area. Service was impeccable. The variety was super. The beach was private and very clean. There were hardly any of the people out on the beach selling you anything.  We dined in and we would go right outside to eat. There were many restaurants in a small…"
5,This was my second trip to Grand Hyatt Bali. The last one as 15 years ago. The resort is about 25 years old with many friendly staff who have been with the hotel from the beginning.   The facilities are well maintained but some people who are after hip design won't like this classic luxury. The established garden is amazing. It gives this resort a unique character. Lots of shades next to the pool and beach so for Asians do not sunbath this resort is perfect.

4,"The grounds are beautiful. The beach is phenomenal. They clean the garbage off the beach every day. The beach is quiet and peaceful, great place to read and fall asleep.  The pool area can get more action - with more families and children hanging out there.   The staff is great.  Everything was clean.  The cold plunge pool is amazing after a hot day exploring Nusa Dua!   Location is great, right beside a big market/shopping area.    The room had some issues, AC stopped working and there was no warm water for a day and a night. For this, I was disappointed to pay full Hyatt price.  Food and alcohol is overpriced for the quality. However, the food at our corporate event was good - I felt it was higher quality than the beach restaurant.   Overall however, amazing experience. "
3,"We recently stayed in the Grand Hyatt Bali for an 8 night holiday with family, booked via Luxury Escapes.  We had issues finding our transfer, but I'm not sure if this is on Gran Hyatt or Luxury Escapes. After half an hour of looking we had them paged and got our transfer sorted.  Check in was efficency and friendly, on arrival at our room we had to specifically asked to have the day bed made up for our  kids.  Generally the gourds are beautiful and breakfast staff friendly. Although we found the pool bar staff disinterested and not very welcoming.  But in saying that given the prices you probably wouldn't spend much time at the bar! It was not a pool bar as such, there is no one going around taking drink orders.  We ordered 1 cocktail, 2 mock tails and 1 juice for 470,000 which…"
5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali is so beautiful and the entire staff is amazing, I  wish I could take them all home with me! We were treated like royalty.  We are Diamond  tier so we always book a suite but every room is perfect.  Definitely worth doing the Club...food is great as is the staff."
5,"My wife and I have just returned home, after a 20 night stay at this resort. What a marvellous hotel, location and setting.  It is the typical Balinese style resort, from the buildings, the dress of the staff, and their smiling faces. The resort is quite large and is in a Balinese, river, pool type setting and lust green plants and surroundings. The property is separated from the beach by a footpath, although there is sufficient swimming pools, there is an area which is ideal for children, water slides and pools. This place is ideal for middle aged people, who just want to relax, or walk.  Great for families with small children. The best part of this area. Being a bit more expensive, it is away from the noise and activities of Kuta, "" no drunken young aussies playing up ""  We…"
4,"This very large resort is situated right on a beautiful beach within an easy distance from the airport (the traffic is terrible in Bali).  Despite its size, the facility is very well run and organized.  The staff manages to make you feel like you are staying in a boutique hotel. There are a number of great pools and the beach is perfect, with trees proving shade rather than umbrellas.  The big disappointment for us was the food.  It was expensive and mediocre at best.  There are a number of options, but each restaurant we tried was worse than the next (with the Italian being by far the worst).  Also not all of the restaurants are air conditioned, making for an uncomfortable meal.  If food is not all that important to you, I highly recommend this resort!"

It makes them feel uncomfortable. Well, its understandable, security reason. But please dont treat the visitors as a thief or something"
5,"I've been here 5 years ago for a business conference and I told myself I'll be brining my loved ones here one day. Here I am in late October 2016, wife and kids enjoyed this place exactly as how I hoped for 5 years ago... and almost everything is preserved.  Room - we loved the day bed and the view. Even the garden view is great, we had a little bit of both.  Pool - we loved the garden pool and there's a decent slide  Garden - it seems that everything is put in a great detail, the ponds, the sculptures, the animals around it. This is something we could never forget  Beach - been to other beaches in Bali, I think this could be one of the best. Less people, the wave are fantastic, good for average surfers.  Breakfast - I've been to many Hyatt hotels, I think that the breakfast…"
5,I never thoght that the hotel would be that big. Lots of plants and trees surrounding the hotel. The staff were very nice and very helpful. Would like to stay here again with my big family some other time
5,Stayed here for the last leg of our honeymoon and it was everything we could've ever imagined. The staff was the best we've come across. So friendly and personable. The property is gorgeous and the rooms were lovely. The beach front is perfect and there are other great spots to walk to down the beach. There's a mall right outside the entrance for cheap eats and shopping. Loved staying here and ending our honeymoon on such a high note! 
4,"Situated in the ""quiet part of town"" The Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua is great for a relaxing, do as much or as little as you want holiday for both couples and families. Nice beaches, beautiful gardens, lagoons and pools with several good restaurants both at the Resort and at Collections Mall just a short walk from the front gate. There is also a Golf course close by and with the new bridge the airport and Seminyak/Kuta are a 30 minute drive away. Would recommend."

3,"Over all the hotel was amazing, lovely gardens with beautiful flowers and great pools. However my husband and I were disappointed to hear after we arrived with luxury escapes that kids club was very expensive for 2 children, more than $100 a day. On other luxury escapes it has been free, so we assumed the same with the Hyatt. If we'd know we wouldn't have stayed. Think we all work really hard for our holidays and we all deserve a break, especially with little support. It didn't mention a charge on their website."
3,"I have made my booking at lower rate, but on arrival they charged more than what i have booked (INR 36000/ appx). I am highly dissatisfied with this behaviour. i have contacted to reception people but they fail to provide the details for the same."
4,"We've been to this hotel a number of times and it is simply lovely. Not as stiff and starchy as some 5 star hotels, but a very special place where you can feel relaxed. We tend to stay in the club area as you get breakfast, all day teas and coffees as well as an afternoon 'happy hour'  - actually a couple of hours - with complementary drinks and eats. The club area is situated in the middle of a lovely pond bursting with Koi carp which you are quite at liberty to feed. There is also a club pool that doesn't get as crowded as the main pool.  This is a large hotel, but because it's spread out with different sections it doesn't feel that large. As you enter the reception area the views of the gardens and sea are stunning.  My wife has tricky allergy eating issues and the staff were…"
4,"A great hotel, conveniently located close to the Bali collection which gives you so many choices for shopping and restaurants. Beach was beautiful, the pools are great. Service in some of the restaurants wasn't the best but not bad. Would recommend it."
5,Had a wonderful holiday with the family at Bali. Thanks to Hyatt for making the holiday more memorable by giving us a suite upgrade. The property at Bali was huge and the kids loved the slide on the river pool.

5,"My family and I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali 4 times and every time has been wonderful.  We cannot say a bad word about the staff and facilities.  Depending on what you want, you can choose to stay by the beach with its clean beaches and deck chairs, relax by the main pool, play with the kids on the waterslide and cave pool or get away from the resort and savour Bali's wonders.  I'm not sure how she does it but the host of he Ambassadors Club greets us by name and comments on how much the girls have grown.  We don't show a key or card but as we walk in she says Hello Mr and Mrs W...   This really makes us feel special.  All the staff are friendly and love the kids.  Nothing is ever too much to ask.

5,"I had never been in a tropical country up to previous March, We went to a beautiful island named Bali All my idea about tropics,was based on cartoons that I had seen in my childhood,but in real world It was better  After a long flight we reached to Bali and went to Grand Hyatt Hotel , where a warm welcome made us peppy! Clean rooms,ocean's sound and view and polite staffs, made our trip memorable, There were different restaurants inside the hotel, you can choose according to your taste! Different pools and skating rink suitable for children, It was so fun to my son that when he understood last night that we want to go back, he was crying and asked me to stay more!!!

4,"Stayed here with the family for 8 nights on a Luxury Escapes package in October 2016.   Summary: The resort is beautiful, the pool is magnificent and location is good. The Luxury Escapes package makes staying here great value, but you are not on a package, then I think you will find this resort poor value (relative to the rest of Bali).  Although we enjoyed our stay, the resort could really benefit from a few improvements.   Resort Facilities & Grounds: Beautiful, spacious grounds with the highlight being an enormous lagoon pool (with 50m waterslide to keep the kids happy).  Note: this is a huge resort with 600+ rooms.  Location: Great location in Nusa Dua, quiet, but still not too far away. Many similar standard resorts are walking distance either side.  The beach is beautiful…"
5,"The Grand Hyatt sits on a huge property and blends extremely well into its surroundings. Given its vastness, you don't see too many people, which is nice. Service was excellent, and I was quite happy to receive a bouquet of flowers as it was my birthday. The rooms are huge and well-appointed, each having a day bed and balcony as well. It is a very traditional resort which would appeal to families or couples who like it quiet and peaceful. I love the place, and hope they can continue to maintain its charm"
3,"Well. I loved the property and its beautiful beach and extensive pools, and that's about it.  The pool towels were torn and tattered. The ground reeked of sewage every morning. The staff either didn't know what I was asking for, or they just loved saying: ""I don't know"", instead of ""let me check"". My bathroom ceiling panel was mouldy. There was a lizard living above my door which freaked me out every time i opened it. No one knew about the departure transfer I had booked in person at the Guest Relations counter. The bedsheets were really rough.   AND THEY FORGOT MY SON'S BIRTHDAY, which in my opinion, is the worst thing they could do since they ask you for special arrangements and things to take note of when you make your reservation.   We go to Bali twice a year, and this was…"

On arrival the staff could not do more to help, the check in process was easy and we were in the room within ten minutes. The first thing I did was turn on the tv, standard practice. It did not work so the chap delivering our bags got a man in to fix it, within five minutes it was all systems go. The first night we had dinner in the hotel and it was some of the best food we had in our two week holiday. During the day the pool was relaxed and the beach was constantly kept clear of litter. The hotel itself is a big complex and I have noticed that some people say it is too big- it is not. The landscaping is absolutely stunning and the hotel is splashed with koi ponds, containing a…"
2,"We stayed at this hotel because we had other family staying at this hotel and we wanted to be at the same location.  We had 2 connecting club rooms for 5 days, one for us and one for our children.  Upon arrival our ACs didn't work properly and the rooms were hot.  The floors were dirty and sandy.  We found a couple of cockroaches running around our bathroom that I had to chase to flush down the toilet.  I had to complain many times with no update on if or when the repairs/service were conducted.  After multiple complaints, they finally managed to satisfactorily service the AC to where we could sleep without sweating. In addition to the AC problem our rooms were also infested with mosquitos where we were getting eaten alive as we slept.  We had to ask for mosquito spray because…"
5,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali for 6 nights in the second half of October 2016. All in all I have to say that it was a fantastic experience and we got exactly the relaxing holiday we were looking for.  There is some element of luck involved in our stay I will confess. I booked through an OTA a deluxe sea view room with access to the club lounge. I was aware that the hotel was almost fully booked for part of our stay due to a conference and this may have played a part in the fact that at check in we were upgraded to a 140 square metre executive suite (Rm 3430), still with sea view and of course still including club lounge access. The suite was huge!  The resort itself is of course very large but what really stands out is the exceptional presentation & landscaping in all areas…"
4,"Great location for the family. Our kids enjoyed the pool & the beach. a nice mall with lot of options on shopping/ food. Highly recommended... dont forget to walk down the beach in the evenings towards a family park with spectacular view of the sea island & waves - (strangely, no one in the hotel mentioned about this place)."
4,"We stayed in the Hotel for 12 days. The standard room (nr. 1317) was big and we had a good time. The size of the room - especially the size of the add-on bed for our daughter - was bigger then in all the hotels we have been so far. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel is well maintained but you may see that it has been there for over 20 years. We would like to point out the wonderful Nampu Japanese Restaurant where we had a great dinner. Improvement is needed when it come to the breakfast buffet. This is not 5*****-like. The cold cuts are not really a delight. Plus there is not enough space for all the guests. What bugs me is, that we asked the front desk twice if there is an alternative space for our breakfast and they said no. On our last day we found out, that we…"

The suite was huge!  The resort itself is of course very large but what really stands out is the exceptional presentation & landscaping in all areas…"
4,"Great location for the family. Our kids enjoyed the pool & the beach. a nice mall with lot of options on shopping/ food. Highly recommended... dont forget to walk down the beach in the evenings towards a family park with spectacular view of the sea island & waves - (strangely, no one in the hotel mentioned about this place)."
4,"We stayed in the Hotel for 12 days. The standard room (nr. 1317) was big and we had a good time. The size of the room - especially the size of the add-on bed for our daughter - was bigger then in all the hotels we have been so far. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel is well maintained but you may see that it has been there for over 20 years. We would like to point out the wonderful Nampu Japanese Restaurant where we had a great dinner. Improvement is needed when it come to the breakfast buffet. This is not 5*****-like. The cold cuts are not really a delight. Plus there is not enough space for all the guests. What bugs me is, that we asked the front desk twice if there is an alternative space for our breakfast and they said no. On our last day we found out, that we…"
5,"Amazing resort ..The Staff is gentle and kind, and the structure is fantastic. We will be back some day .. We really enjoy all restaurants and shows .. The swimming pool is huge and the beach is almost a private one. perfect for kids or Romantic Trip."
5,"We had excellent experience during our stay in Grand Hyatt Bali in every aspect from arrival to the Hotel until the very last moment. We have stayed in Ocean View King Room which was more than convenient for my wife, our two 8 and 10 year old daughters and myself even without extra bed keeping in mind the fact that king bed and sofa bed in the Room could easily accomodate our Family for night time rest. All Hotel facilities were great and very clean, swiming pool, beach access, gym with sauna, hot and cold spa pool and outdoor pool, beach sport facilities, all in function and very well maintained to make Your stay fully relaxed keeping in mind also the fact that we did not perceived that Hotel is crowded at any moment except during breakfast time between 08:30 and 09:30 am at…"
5,"We have just returned from 15 nights at the grand Hyatt. We had a wonderful time. We we're collected at the airport and check in was very smooth, much needed after a 24 hour journey.  Our room was spacious with a day bed for our child and a terrace overlooking a pond   The hotel buildings are stunning with a prime position on the beach. If you are beach lovers this is the hotel for you. Wide open white sands with trees for shade. It was so lovely and quiet too and swimming in the warm ocean was bliss. The hotel pools were great and plenty of sunbeds, never any problems getting one. The slides are great fun for children and adults and it's a perfect family hotel.  The restaurants were good too. Yes they are not the cheapest but the food and staff are lovely. You can eat in Bali…"
4,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali in late September / early October for our honeymoon. The exterior of the hotel is absolutely stunning and this is evident instantly upon arrival with a beautiful reception area overlooking the ocean. The gardens are beautiful and well kept. I would say this is the highlight of the hotel.  We arrived in reception and our booking was a honeymoon booking, as we are a same sex couple, the staff were very confused and thought they had got the wrong booking which made the situation very uncomfortable. I appreciate the country isn't as familiar with same sex marriage so we kept to ourselves and avoided engaging with anyone after this just to avoid any further discomfort.  The rooms were nice and spacious but a little dated. However, I wouldn't say it…"
4,Overall satisfaction of Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua is very good.  So far this is the only hotel I stayed whenever I am in Bali whether it be on vacation or business/meetings. The location is perfect -- peaceful and tranquil and away from all the noises from some places in Bali.

5,"Grand Hyatt Bali stands out for its generous landscaped grounds, which surround the medium-rise buildings on all sides. Paths lead through garden beds and across charming bridges over meandering streams, with views to lotus lagoons from our room. We enjoyed watching various wading birds in the lagoons, not to mention the squirrels which would come scampering by looking for food, even pilfering the offerings in the small shrines dotted around the resort.  There is a choice of swimming pools, large and small, with full service available and, of course, there is the beach. Whatever you do, don't miss having a cocktail at the rooftop Salsa Bar with stunning views of the Nusa Dua coastline.  The staff were unfailingly charming and attentive.  Nusa Dua is a gated community, so…"
4,"The hotel is great , the beach and garden are well kept . Did love it all .   The only thing that annoyed me was how horrendously high the price everything £6 for coke . Restraunt prices higher than anywhere ive been before .  Just doesnt make any buissness sense you would want your guests to use all your restaurants and buy everything in the.complex . The shop there charged us £9 for packet crisps and a some biscuits.   Staff were pleasant as was house keeping  Beach was lovely . The sellers  were pleasant and not pushy and way cheaper than the markets .  Bali collection were we ate majority off our meals were hit and miss cheaper but tourist prices.  Dont be afraid to venture out side the nusa dua complex much cheaper and better food ."
5,"We have traveled to numerous Hyatt locations and this property is stunning. There are so many pools you can find your own private spot to swim for the day. The beach is gorgeous white sand and a tide that allows you to swim most of the day. The food on the property is delicious and although slightly expensive, it is authentic and you can find what you are looking for. We had a suite and it was magnificent, with a sitting and dining area, large balcony and huge master bedroom and bathroom area. We loved the location -- easy to bike to nearby places or walk to restaurants and bars."
5,"this is an excellent hotel, the staff are most helpful especially the staff in the CLUB LOUNGE. We had a really relaxing stay and had no issues whatsoever and they staff went out of their way to make our holiday really good"
5,From the minute I arrived at the hotel the staff welcomed with a genuine smile !! the rooms are spacious with all the comforts imaginable !!! The hotel is super clean !!food is delicious and the quality is definitely there !!very attentive waiters !! the spa treatments are super !! Congratulations to the managment and all the staff for the passion and the fantastic service !!I cannot wait to come back !!by the way I loved your show dinner night 😀

5,"The Grand Hyatt is a great property and has the wow factor about it as soon as you walk into the reception area and see the stunning view.  We got married on the beach surrounded by our family and friends and I have to say the hotel staff were amazingly attentive and helpful and really went the extra mile to ensure we had a day to remember.  The setting on the beach was beautiful and laid out with flower petals.  The communal areas in the resort are top class, plenty of space around the various pools, lovely bars and cocktails at sunset on the terrace at Salsa Verde is a must.  The rooms were really well presented and clean with great amenities.  Staff were really helpful but in a fairly laid back way, which fits perfectly with the surroundings.  The Bali collection is also just…"
4,"We booked this hotel paying GBP200 per night, we notice some ants on 1st night on extra bed and ignored and next day there were too many coming from somewhere.  1am in the morning, Kids tired but no bed to sleep, we have asked hotel to put extra bed as difficult to change room at this time with stuff.  Rest all good, but this is the really bad experience we having today Deepak Arora"
2,The room was okay but not the newest. The service was very good an all the stuff tried their best to satisfy the clients. The food on the other hand was terrible and therefore the rating is only two stars since food is most important aspect for me after the room. Besides the food the restaurant is suggested.
5,"grand Club at grand hyatt is my favorite place in bali since over 20 years. why should I buy a villa in bali when I can get such a excellent level of service and privacy at the Grand Hyatt? This is the question i have every time and my choice goes to hyatt every time. beside the staff does not change adding a feeling of being home. thanks you to Ari, adi and all others who are greeting me years after years."
5,"We were on the 8 night Grand Room Luxury Escape Holiday Package which proved to be exceptional value and didn't disappoint in any way shape or form. Our holiday commenced with being transported smoothly to the hotel on arrival at Denpasar by the friendly Hyatt representative. At check in our designated room hadn't been finished cleaning as the hotel was full. We accepted this (tidak apa apa - no problem for us) but the kind reception clerk checked the system and allocated us another room in the South Wing on the 4th floor that overlooked a pond with ducks and beautiful gardens. Our room was spacious with an extremely comfortable king size bed with comfy pillows. There's also a day bed to lounge on. The bathroom has a bath and separate shower with plenty of ablutions (toothbrush,…"

2,"We came here for our honeymoon. We were ""upgraded"" to a nice room on arrival.  Hotel is nice staff are attentive, great choice in food and restaurants however pricing is inflated. Bit ridiculous really considering other places we have stayed. If pricing was better we'd consider coming again but won't come back at this stage.   "
2,the cost of food and beverages at this hotel was ridiculously expensive - more expensive than a 5 star hotel in my home city which is truly unbelievable given the general cost in the rest of Bali and the exchange rate between the 2 countries. If not for the ludicrous expense I would have rated this hotel as excellent
3,"Beautiful hotel, with colorful gardens, large landscaped pools and fantastic beach. The kids loved the playground on the beach and the waterslide. We had a good time. Maybe the service in the hotel could be improved, but we have no comparison in Bali."

3,"We stayed at the Hyatt on the Luxury escape package which was value for money. Day two we had $150 AU taken from our safe.... yes it was left open, yes it was a silly mistake, however the handling of it by the hotel was pretty poor. Just lacked any urgency and real process which is the issue. When we asked for an internal report at least to support an insurance claim they declined saying they didn't document such things? So how can you monitor trends and similar occurrences if you don't track these things? I don't believe this to be a good enough response for such a resort. Very disappointing and concerning. Secondly all but 2 days of our stay started off with the same question ""you must pay extra for breakfast"". On day 6 the head of the restaurant could see my frustration at…"
5,"My friend and I bought a Luxury Escapes package to the Grand Bali Hyatt. We chose an upgrade to an Emerald pool room which was well worth it. The secluded pool is a little cooler than the others and in a very quiet location. The rooms are a little dated but spacious with good storage. The Hyatt is simply stunning with the most beautiful gardens I've ever seen. Everyday we discovered a new pool or facility to use. Our package included breakfasts which we could have in a range of restaurants and a variety of other meals, all of which were sensational. The spa treatments also were amazing and in beautiful facilities. The staff are incredibly friendly, polite and helpful. Security is very obvious and we always felt very safe. Wifi was available in our room and throughout the…"

5,"Not a paper serviette anywhere, so I knew I was in for an amazing holiday. The rooms are just as pictured online and kept the exact same way on a daily basis. From the moment you pull up at the lobby with the doors of the vehicle opened immediately and the sounding of the welcoming gong, you know you are in for an incredible stay. If your uncertain of anything just pick up the phone in your room and ask the concierge, who answers immediately. The choice of restaurants caters to every taste imaginable or you can have something cooked that's more specific, e.g. gluten free, vegetarian. I was kept informed of any event that was happening on the grounds, so got to see an amazing wedding on the beach. So many pools to choose from and such lavish surrounds. The were even waiters…"

The room was excellent, very quiet and clean (our room was located at the South Village). There's plenty of good restaurants and the beakfast was great (again very friendly staff!). The pools and beach are very nice and well maintained. There are lots of facilities like an ATM machine and money transfer and there's free WiFi across the Resort. The location is great with lots of shops and restaurants at walking distance and lots of other activities and sightseings nearby. We had a great time and definitely like to come back in the future. Highly recommended!"
5,"My family & I stayed for 8 nights on a luxury escapes package with an upgrade to an emerald pool room. After reading some of the reviews being hit & miss, I was a bit concerned but there was no need to be. Yes the rooms probably aren't 5 star anymore but as a travel agent that has viewed over 60 properties in and around Nusa Dua and the Kuta area - this is definitely one of the better ones! The marble bathrooms are huge, the king beds are bigger than king, the day bed was great for my toddler & even with a porta cot set up (which was great quality) we still had room to move about. The restaurants were fantastic with the Japanese being our highlight along with the buffet dinner & cultural show. The champagne breakfast is not too be missed (we almost thought about it) and the day…"

5,Our experience was exceptional and beyond our expectation. The property grounds are amazing very relaxing and well manicured. The room was very spacious and an amazing view from the balcony. The Restaurants and Bars all very good and the Staff always Smiling and Friendly. Thank you for an amazing holiday experience.
4,Resort style hotel more suitable for families. What impressed me most is the beautiful landscaping of its gardens that provides a tranquil and breathtaking views which I have yet to see in other resorts. It has a beautiful garden and private beach. Walking distance to a shopping and dining area with many spas to choose from. Initially gotten a room with a very bad smell of cigarettes but was ok after they changed us to another room. Room is spacious and comfortable.

1,Not a place I will revisit anytime soon.  Property is showing its age (50 years?) and service levels are pre-historic too.  You are better off staying at one of hundreds of other 5 star hotels in Bali.  I am never returning.
2,"The rooms are large but are like they were in 1989 plus 25 Years of wear. They are dark, many finishes are worn, stained or broken and much of the furniture is original from opening. Our first room when arriving had extensive mould covering the shutters separating the bathroom from the bedroom, the second room air con did not lower the ambient temp below 27 even in the middle of the night. Maintenance came popped their head in the roof and admitted the problem the next day and that was the last we heard before leaving our booking early. It's a shame as the expansive grounds, impressive reception and pool, nice (if not over priced) restaraunts and friendly staff all do their best to leave a good impression but come on owners, close one wing at a time, put a major cash injection…"
5,"Grand Hyatt Bali is really perfect,we enjoyed our stay there.Everything excellent without any single negative point.Being right on the beach is its property;whole area and the beach very clean.Swimming pools very good.Rooms big with balconies and nice view of ocean and sunrise.Facilities great,staff very friendly.It is a real 5 star modern hotel with tropical gardens,lagoons and sand beach. We stayed for 6 nights and could not be happier......;will choose this hotel again for sure. Recommend Grand Hyatt to those who search for relaxing and amazing place for their vacation."
5,"I had previously worked in Bali and stayed in the Hyatt in Sanur, but whilst on holidays with my wife we decided to stay in the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. It was a great choice.  Book a hotel taxi to save you from the airport scammers and arrive in comfort. Upon arrival, staff seated us in the lobby and promptly provided us refreshing cool towels and cocktails. I used Hyatt Points for the hotel stay, and as such, I was provided a wonderful room with views of the pool area.   We opted for a light breakfast and coffee, which was delivered to our room on schedule every day. The resort is quite large, and we preferred the relaxing in-room option as opposed to walking to the restaurant each day. Rooms were beautifully appointed and kept in immaculate order. My wife and I have stayed at a…"

Our first room when arriving had extensive mould covering the shutters separating the bathroom from the bedroom, the second room air con did not lower the ambient temp below 27 even in the middle of the night. Maintenance came popped their head in the roof and admitted the problem the next day and that was the last we heard before leaving our booking early. It's a shame as the expansive grounds, impressive reception and pool, nice (if not over priced) restaraunts and friendly staff all do their best to leave a good impression but come on owners, close one wing at a time, put a major cash injection…"
5,"Grand Hyatt Bali is really perfect,we enjoyed our stay there.Everything excellent without any single negative point.Being right on the beach is its property;whole area and the beach very clean.Swimming pools very good.Rooms big with balconies and nice view of ocean and sunrise.Facilities great,staff very friendly.It is a real 5 star modern hotel with tropical gardens,lagoons and sand beach. We stayed for 6 nights and could not be happier......;will choose this hotel again for sure. Recommend Grand Hyatt to those who search for relaxing and amazing place for their vacation."
5,"I had previously worked in Bali and stayed in the Hyatt in Sanur, but whilst on holidays with my wife we decided to stay in the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. It was a great choice.  Book a hotel taxi to save you from the airport scammers and arrive in comfort. Upon arrival, staff seated us in the lobby and promptly provided us refreshing cool towels and cocktails. I used Hyatt Points for the hotel stay, and as such, I was provided a wonderful room with views of the pool area.   We opted for a light breakfast and coffee, which was delivered to our room on schedule every day. The resort is quite large, and we preferred the relaxing in-room option as opposed to walking to the restaurant each day. Rooms were beautifully appointed and kept in immaculate order. My wife and I have stayed at a…"
5,"Perfect for a beach getaway, never left the resort, great value, only negative dinner was ok but breakfast and lunch good.   Property is beautiful and its right on the beach.   Rooms are huge with balconies and the views at sunrise are spectacular "
5,"Stayed for 5 nights, couldn't be happier. Will be back for sure. From the moment i checked in my experience was second to none. Staff amazing, facilities are great and overall a very good stay and i look forward to returning."
5,"They say that Grand Hyatt Bali is the crown jewel of resorts in Nusa Dua, and they were right.   Just 15 minutes from Bali International Airport, the gated Grand Hyatt blends Balinese charm and 5-star modern conveniences.  With a  magnificent foyer,  tropical gardens, lagoons, and white sand beach this has to be the place to stay if wanting to avoid all the craziness that Bali is known for.  We stayed in one of the Grand Club Rooms which was well worth the extra cost.  The exclusive Grand Club Lounge with its elegant modern Balinese design and views of the lily pond and tropical gardens definitely made the experience a memorable one.  From the personalised check-in/out service, complimentary daily breakfast and evening drinks and canapes and all-day refreshments this is the…"
3,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 8 nights with complimentary breakfast 1 culture show and 1 30 min massage.I went with my two adult children there spouses and 3 grand children. The breakfasts were great, the pool with the slide was a lot of fun for the grandkids.It is a very nice hotel with spacious grounds probably too large it looses its personal touch. Bring your money with you when it comes to eating and drinking at the hotel extremely overpriced. The rooms were spacious and clean a little tired looking. We ate across the road at the Bali collection again prices were high and food not that good. We mainly ate outside the gates as the hotel was too expensive. The culture show was good but the food not really geared at children we had to order chips at a cost of $8.50 (aust)…"
5,"My family and I spent 8 nights at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua, and it was soooo relaxing. The wether was very kind to us, and we took full advantage of the wonderful facilities at the resort. We had rooms in the North wing, which have been refurbished, and are really lovely - huge bathroom. The swimming pools are amazing, and it's nice to be able to switch between sea and pool, thanks to the private beach. The resort SPA was brilliant - my wife and I had 2 90 minute sessions there. Although you can get massages far cheaper outside the resort, our package included SPA treatments - so we took full advantage. One comment is that for a resort this big, I think it needs at least one more dining choice for dinner."
4,"We have stayed in the Grand Hyatt several times and would do so again, as it is as beautiful as ever, with impressive and extensive gardens, Birdlife, water features, and attractive public areas. We were disappointed however, but on arrival at the club lounge in the evening, it took an extraordinarily Long time to check us in. We then opted to upgrade our room at a cost of $30 per night to be on the ground floor and is near the club pool. The room was that was comfortable and spacious, was rather tired looking-woodwork looks in need of varnishing and decorations looked a little dated.  The breakfast service and complimentary drinks and canapés were all to a high standard, with a wide choice and generously available. The Garden Cafe restaurant, where we ate on the first evening…"

3,"We stayed here on the Luxury Escapes 8 night package deal. It seemed like a good deal. But if I had my time over, I'd spend my money more wisely. We could have spent less money and had far better accommodation and food, and been in an area with more to do and see.   Rooms:  Cons- dark, dank, strong swampy/mouldy smell, found a cockroach in bathroom, septic plumbing sometimes smelly, dual head in shower didn't work. We were quite a walk from pool area (~200m). Pros- housekeeping were prompt and effective.  Very generous with bottled water. We had a big verandah on lagoon.   Food/drinks/service: Food and drinks are soooo overpriced and food was really average, sometimes even pretty bad. Breakfast was good. Staff were very friendly, attentive and helpful though.  …"
4,Immaculate grounds and setting. Staff were sincere and friendly and were genuinely eager to help. Several different restaurants serving different styles of food. Loved the sundowner cocktails every evening.
5,"AMAZING staff.  If you are looking for a beautiful hotel on a paradisiac beach, this is your hotel.  The food, the views, the breakfast with sea views.  We spend a few days there to cure our jet lag and it was perfect"
4,"The property is amazing with green places, flowers, swimming pools and the ocean nearby. The staf is very friendly and helpfull, breakfast services are good. Please take care of small animals like lizards which can be in some rooms. For example we had one in our room. The reception desk people helped us to catch it and finally because they didn't manage to catch it they gave us another room. Breakfast is good with many options of food."
3,"While they have so beautiful pools and trees together with perfect beach, the quality of service shall be improved. We had to wait for our luggage for more than 30 mins, wait for the breakfast sit for more than 15 mins, and another long wait for dinner served at the japanese resto. "

3,"Pros: location, nice facilities for solo and family travelers, descent size rooms well equipped with amenities, many pools and nice beach  Cons: room, especially bathroom, requires significant renovation, breakfast at Watercourt restaurant was so so, lunch there wasn't good  Can't really recommend unless hotel adheres to Grand Hyatt benchmark"
5,"We had a fabulous time at the Hyatt and would love to go back.  What made it special was the beautiful landscaping: the resort complex is full of courtyards with lily ponds, carvings and stone bridges and the pool complex is skilfully planted with frangipane trees, bougainvillea and palms.  The layout means that there is always a lovely view and it never feels crowded.  We upgraded to Sapphire Rooms, on the ground floor in the North Village with access to a smaller and more private pool.  Totally worth it.  Beds were super comfy and we loved the enormous bathroom and day bed.  The beach is clean and spacious but we spent most of our time by the pool,  with the kids loving the waterslide and jacuzzi.    Breakfasts were good and varied though sometimes the service suffered when…"
4,"The resort is so beautiful that you enjoy spending your vacation there and the restaurants and bars serve delicious foods and good beverages. """"The room needs renovation"""" and the mini bar is poor. The taxi of the hotel is very expensive. "
5,"We bought a luxury escapes deal. (Great deal!!) The room itself was spacious and overlooked the lagoon. It was comfortable enough for 5 people. The location of the hotel is A+ for location. Bali Collection is a short stroll to all the shops and restaurants. You are welcomed with cool drinks and cool towels. The many pools and waterslide was a hit with the kids. There was a play gym on the beach. Poolside food is expensive as expected. The breakfast buffet was a little disappointing. Not much range in tropical fruit or other food for that matter. I had previously stayed at another Nusa Dua 5 star hotel and was expecting the same level and variety of food. Not so. The breakfast was the same thing every morning alternating soup every day with not much change, which made it boring…"
3,"The grounds are beautiful and luxurious. The rooms are looking shabby and need upgrading. The food was below standard for a five star resort. At breakfast, ordering from the a la carte menu led to the staff deciding that they could just take food from the buffet and put it on a plate. This was unacceptable as the a la carte breakfast should have been made fresh from the kitchen. They could learn how to speed up the check in/ check out process as the queues were to long taking more than 30 minutes to check out. A lot to improve. "

4,"A good place for staying with your family. We had a good stay there. A place that has many preferences for kids, such as kids club, big pool, beach, animals around and beautiful scenery. They should open the pool earlier :D"
5,"We stayed in Nusa Dua a couple times now and we sure are glad we are now staying at this beautiful & lush resort. The property is surrounded with beautiful, well manicured lawn with ducks, cranes and iguanas running around.   They have a HUGE property with 3 or 4 pools. There is one with a slide that is family friendly. The property is right next to the beach. The beach itself is ok. Soft smooth sand but during the low tide, you can barely dip yourself in it. We walked around the beach during the low tide (around 3pm) and was able to spot some crabs & fish in the tide pools. My daughter found it interesting even though she didn't get to play in the water.   This resort is definitely family friendly. Lots of kids so you may want to stay away from this resort if you don't care for…"
5,"All that you hear and more!! I am a Hyatt diamond member and stayed in one of their suites. I have stayed at a lot of Hyatt's and I'll use this review for the hotel in general and not the suite (which was also amazing!)  This hotel is by far one of the most picturesque hotels I have been to. The grounds were spotless, the staff was amazing. Every single staff member I came in contact with always had a smile and ALWAYS greeted you with a friendly hello. Of course, I found this to be true all over Bali.   The hotel is huge with so much to see. I cannot find one thing to complain about with this hotel. If you have a complaint here there is probably something wrong with you!! Just saying.   Yes, the hotel is within the security zone and can be far for doing things but do not feel…"
5,"We purchased an 8 day Luxury Escapes package and weren't left disappointed.  The grounds of the Grand Hyatt were immaculate with amazing gardens wherever you looked. The pools were heated - almost too hot in the biggest pool. The waterslide was amazing for a resort - it kept all the kids (and adults) well amused for countless hours. The staff were all very lovely and attentive. The on-site spa was by far the most luxurious spa we had ever experienced - well worth a visit.  The only negatives are minor, but still worth mentioning to the hotel so they can be aware of the impact.  1 - The pools all close by 7pm, so if you want to go for an after-dinner (or pre-dinner) swim, it's impossible, as the security guards make you get out.  2 - Allocating breakfast restaurant based on…"
4,"It's an old hotel and the complex is very huge, first day of my stay, i got lost, thanks to signage that guide me back to my very room. Too bad at that time was raining, need to bring umbrella to stroll around the hotel complex. the beach was superb and quite clean, the swimming pool was amazing! too bad i didn't bring my kids :D. there were 2 restaurants for breakfast that serves same food, i think the food is ok. Love the amenity, love the bed, it was huge, staff service is so so. i think this hotel would be suitable for family, rather than business"

5,"We have been coming to this resort, almost yearly, since our daughter was 2 years old. She is now 7. There are several wonderful things about this place. Firstly, the resort never ages! It is so beautifully maintained that all the rooms and facilities are as pristine as they have always been. Contrast that to some other older establishment in the vicinity, where decay with age is almost palpable. Grand Hyatt does a wonderful job keeping the place fresh and vibrant. Secondly, it must be due to wonderful management that there are many staff who have been there for years, some of them decades, and they recognise me and my family each time we visit. In particular, Ibu Warti of the Kids' Club has been looking after my daughter through the years and has practically seen her grow up.…"
5,"Beautiful Resort with very friendly staff. Our first room had some small problems, but after talking to the helpdesk we immediately got another room, which was perfect; very clean and comfortable. The whole resort is beautifully decorated and the friendly staff makes you feel very comfortable and welcome. The location is very good with a small shopping centre with lots of great restaurants at walking distance. The centre of Kuta is just ~20-30 minutes by cab, as are lots of activities and sight seeings. The resort has a very nice beach, nice swimming pools and restaurants. There's WiFi available throughout the resort and there's a good ATM and current exchange included. Highly recommended!"
5,I've been at Bali for 11 days with various hotels which all are 5* hotels but Grand Hyatt was the best  I recommend every one willing to enjoy the time and water blow to stay at Grand Hyatt bali which is in Nusa due 
5,"Grand Hyatt was an amazing resort to celebrate our daughters 21st and 18th birthdays and our wedding anniversary. From the moment we steep into our Secret Pool Room we were greeted with a bouquet of flowers for our anniversary and a beautiful note. Special thank you to Ninnik, Bulan and Budi, for making our stay a memorable one."
5,"Three generations met at The Grand Hyatt for a family holiday. Friendly efficient staff, a great location and excellent family facilities contributed to a great holiday over 10 days. The Luxury Escapes package at the Hyatt  worked smoothly and was excellent value for money, apart from a delayed airport pickup problem for one family."

4,A very big comfy hotel in the exclusive area in Nusa Dua Bali. The room is very nice with a traditional ambience. If you like jogging then you can enjoy exploring the hotels area sorounded by big tress and many free birds flying around. The white beach is just a few steps from your room. The swimming pools are amazing. But unfortunately the food is not so amazing it just standard.   Very good place for both business or leisure.  
4,"stayed their for 3 day. Property is good, spread across & with all the amenities one expects in a 5 star property. Pool, multiple restaurants/breakfast places. It's located in nusa dua which is would say is central place for visiting other places in bali  It's got it's own private beach which is nice & clean. Rooms are clean & cosy good for stay with family with balcony having view either of the beach/garden etc.  Food is nice & elaborate spread of menu.   Staff is courteous, had my mother (senior citizen) with me & needed wheel chair from room to lobby. Staff dropped her to lobby but getting assistance to the room is challenge. Since property is vastly spread walking is challenge for elderly. May be it is staff challenge, don't know.  Their is local community market just out…"
5,Cannot say anything except what a fantastic experience well done your hospitality was fabulous and would recommend anyone to go there. The staff were very friendly and couldn't do more for you. Even the grounds men 
3,"Hotel remains its 5-star level look at the lobby, swimming pool, restaurant, beach. Staff was helpful but if more smiles would be better.   The rooms conditions were not really well. The hardware need to be upgraded if it is so call 5 star hotel...."
5,We had a wonderful 8 nights at the Grand Hyatt. Our connecting rooms (as we were staying with kids) were ready and organised. The staff could not do enough for us. The food was great at all restaurants. Very relaxing and carefree. Will go back again. The proximity to Bali Collections (a shopping/eating village) is very handy.

I love the experience here and will definitely be returning.  I have stayed here with family previously and this time I went alone.
5,"We enjoy our vacation especially inside hotel facilities, sightseeing beach, near to shopping area, food, nice rest, etc.  We can have a bicycle for sightseeing , go to Bali Collection have some shopping, food, souvenir and a lot of thing that we can have a look."
1,"Whilst the ground staff were lovely and always had a smile on their faces, the reception and guest services teams were utterly abysmal. Rude and unhelpful to say the least, and not to mention deceitful when quoting prices over the phone which they then reneged on upon check out. Would not stay here again."
1,"Come on guys!!! You are 5* hotel on best Ireland in the world!!! This hotel needs renovation! I didn't expect that Hyatt could have  -old doors,windows and furniture!!  -Doors can't prevent noises from outside!  -World know chain with such dirty beach?! -plastic sun beds -looooooog queues for breakfast  -breakfast as in 3* hotel - simple verity :( -fruits not tasty !!!  I'm second day here and thinking over to move to another one which worth it's money!      "
4,"I came here for business, a conference to be exact. This is my first time staying at this place. The hotel is too big, even walking from the receptionist to my room took almost 10 minutes.   The hotel design is old, but my room interior was quite nice and modern. The bath tub is broken, but probably not happen in all rooms.  They have like 4 restaurants; italian, japan, western and Indonesian. Since Nusa Dua is pretty far from the rest of area in Denpasar you will probably spending your time inside the hotel's area.  They got complete morning event like yoga, running etc. But I can't describe how they were since I didn't join any of them.  My final words; if you coming to Bali with family (and you have money) you can stay here. But if you coming to exploring Bali, I suggest you…"
4,I stayed here to use points that I have accumulated and they treated me like a paying customer.  The staff are friendly and courteous and the grounds are always just so beautiful.  I love the experience here and will definitely be returning.  I have stayed here with family previously and this time I went alone.
5,"We enjoy our vacation especially inside hotel facilities, sightseeing beach, near to shopping area, food, nice rest, etc.  We can have a bicycle for sightseeing , go to Bali Collection have some shopping, food, souvenir and a lot of thing that we can have a look."
1,"Whilst the ground staff were lovely and always had a smile on their faces, the reception and guest services teams were utterly abysmal. Rude and unhelpful to say the least, and not to mention deceitful when quoting prices over the phone which they then reneged on upon check out. Would not stay here again."

2,"We've stayed here many times and the standard is slipping. The staff seem unhappy, overworked and frustrated. The rooms need a refresh and the food and Bev needs a major revamp. With comparable hotels in the area the overall standard is below other 5 star properties. The breakfast would be better suited to a 3-4 star hotel. The rooms are getting very dated and we moved because the first rooms aircon wasn't working properly. We've always come here because the kids love the waterslide however as they are getting older we will most likely stay in hotels like the Sofitel or the Weston if we were down in Nusa Dua. "
5,"Our first and only choice of hotel when it comes to booking a holiday in Bali...this is our 4th time booking in for a family holiday and each time we are further impressed with the standard of service, hospitality and friendliness shown to our family. Impeccable facilites, outstanding quality and variety of food to meet the needs of both adults and children, professional and conscientious staff who go out of their way to make every aspect of your stay enjoyable. We highly recommend the Hyatt in Nusa Dua as a perfect family holiday.  The Hamiltons from Perth, Australia."
5,"In a nutshell this was the deal of a lifetime.  What a wonderful hotel with great service, fabulous facilities and so many extras in the package.  We upgraded to the 8 night VIP option and would definitely snap up this quality offer if it comes around again.  Use the vouchers from the beginning of your stay so you don't miss out. The rooms are ample, the grounds are extensive and beautiful, and the staff were faultlessly helpful.  It is a great spot for families with the myriad of pools and the proximity to the beach. Loved Nampu and the Garden Cafe and that Champagne brunch was unbelievably good.  Thank you Hyatt team for a wonderful holiday"
5,"We stayed at the Hyatt and absolutely loved it. The rooms are good,very friendly staff, amazing pools, mind blowing spa and a large coastline, this resort has a lot to offer. We did not even get out of the resort for most part of our holiday and still did not get bored. We were on the luxury escapes package so lots of dinners/ lunches/ experiences were included.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would go back. "
5,"The staffs are very helpful. We got the club twin room instead of club king as booked, and raised a complaint, they convert it into king the next morning, easy!   I love the spacious room and I think the closet is big enough. I love the view at the lobby, and I love the fact that they have a very reliable internet connection.   Thank you Hyatt, for the lovely stay. "

5,"My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt from 26 September to 4 October 2016 using a Luxury Escapes package which included a number of meals and nightly cocktails.  The room was wonderful near to the beach and a pool.  Despite the size of the Hyatt you can often feel like you are the only people in the place.  Food in all the restaurants was nice.  The beach was also wonderful with fewer beach peddlers and definitely less aggressive in their sales attempts than other parts of Bali.  My wife and I can only criticise three things about our stay:  1)  The best place to have the sunset cocktail is the Salsa Bar looking over the ocean, however this was often spoiled due the large family groups also taking advantage of the bar,  which is fine except their kids were left to run amok…"
5,"We are a family of 4 and recently stayed at the Hyatt in connecting rooms (1 king and 2 twin beds). This property is huge so if you don’t like walking you should request a room closest to the pool or the lobby. The hotel is older but extremely well maintained. The rooms are a bit dated but very comfortable and immaculately cleaned every day. Each room also has a day bed in it that could sleep 2 small children.   The pool areas are well shaded, surrounded by stunning gardens and have a beautiful view of the beach. We never had any trouble getting a sun lounge.  Breakfast options were plentiful and the service 5 star. In fact the service at all of the restaurants was 5 star.  The food in the Teppanyaki restaurant was amazing, the Italian restaurant very nice and the Indonesian…"
5,"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Nusa Dua for 6 nights. Beautiful resort set in lovely gardens with a long stretch of a beautiful beach on site!  I loved this place, has almost everything in one place! The resort has several restaurants and bars, my favourite place was the Salsa Bar over looking the beach where one can enjoy a cold cocktail while enjoying the cooling breeze.   Large pool area with an interesting kiddies section and play centre. Clean beach that stretch across a number of resorts, not crowded and free of vendors.   Bali collections - a centre with shops, restaurants and massage places is just across from the resort entrance, convenient for guests to walk across for shopping or to try a new restaurant.  Very friendly staff, after a couple of days some of the…"
5,"This is truly amazing place with private beach and beautiful view. The staff is very friendly and cooperative. There is scope to include different cuisine based on the types of guest. Since we were pure Indian vegetarian, food options were very limited but the staff tried their best to make us happy. loved the pool design."
3,"We are a family of 4, and we occupied 2 rooms. On the first night of our stay, one of the table lamps in the room cannot be turned off. We waited for a long time and confirmed that it's an infrastructure issue which the technician could not fix. He simply unplugged the power, and it remained not fixed during our stay. On the second day, the door won't open when I wanted to get my camera to take pictures of my son surfing. I had to walk from the room to the lobby twice and then waited for the service manager to open the door for me., by the time I got my camera, my son had finished his surfing lesson. On the other hand, staff are mostly very polite and nice. We appreciated the service manager who took our feedback positively."

5,"I stayed at Grand Club Room, Grand Hyatt Bali, for 4 days 3 nights. Below are some points from my experience:  1. The Room The room is nice with a good amenities. You can find sewing kit to cottons to an iron. All are there. The water is also good.  2. Breakfast The menu selection at Grand Club lounge is so-so. They only provide any kind of eggs, bacon/sausage, potatoes, and pancake. But they also provide a lot of bread/cake selections. What i like the most is the beverages and the desserts. Love it. Unfortunately, they don't provide a ""pressed juice"" where you can ask them to make a fresh juice from any kind of fruits that provided on the buffet table. Today, this kind of juice is usually provided at luxury hotels.   3. The beach It has private beach and it's awesome. Not too…"
5,"Really enjoyed our 8 night stay at the Grand Hyatt.  Most relaxing, great gardens & pools and a good on-site beach.  We may have been lucky with our room allocation, but it was excellent - and with the best (quietest & perfect temperature) air conditioner we have experienced anywhere around the world. The staff do an excellent job keeping the grounds and pools pristine - and the beach in pretty good condition considering the amount of rubbish washing up on almost every high tide.  It's certainly not the cheapest around, but if you want relaxing (and out of the ""madness"" of the ""real Bali""), this is one to consider.   Staff extremely friendly with a strong service ethic (despite some of the clients they have to deal with) and even the beach vendors are relaxed. If you want to get…"
4,"A beautiful Resort , the gardens are amazing. It is a five star resort so prices and experience reflect this. Bali Collection is very close with lots of shops and restraunts, but more Australian prices because you can not bargain. You are a little isolated if you want to experience the markets and cheap Bali experience. "
4,"Resort has a nice mix of pool and the sea shore. It is located in a tranquil area in Nusa Dua. Friendly staff, lot of waterbodies makes it very picturesque. Plenty of walking space and good facilities for a conferences. Not many options for vegetarians and I cannot comment about the non vegetarian food."
3,Overall rooms tired and food service was average to poor for a vegetarian poor choice of menu. Appears the chef cannot do vegetarian meals. Had a number of conference meals and breakfast. The breakfast service does not cater for vegetarians at all. The omelette maker was mixing utensils up for so really no respect for someone who does not eat meat. Not expect that from a top hotel. overall the breakfast service area was small. Conference meals had to make requests for veg meals as opposed to having them ready on the buffet service especially when catering for an international group. Probably has something to learn say from Emirates Airline.

5,"I love love love it amazing i wish if i can go back one day . One of my best hotel . So big and luxury. Good for family, for couples and for friends. At the beach and what i liked the most was the very cleaned beach and his color is very pure and transparent. I recommend it . Located in nusa dua a luxury city in bali and 10 min away from the activities beach . I've been there for 5 days for my honeymoon and i've enjoyed very much . The service is very good the breakfast was from different country not only balinese food. And there is 3 different restaurant where u can choose every day one between them to take your breakfast . And you can go by walking 2 min to the bali collection . "
5,We came for a relaxed family holiday.  The gardens and pool were stunning and apart from the slide area (which was naturally busy) the pools were so spacious you could find your own area.  The beach was great and all family members were catered for 
4,"If you're wondering how large 16 hectares are... walk around Grand Hyatt Bali... one could really get lost in here... but getting lost in paradise is part of the fun :)  the rooms, buildings, and grounds are pretty old with partial renovations quite strikingly different from original sections. Stepping into Kriya Spa took you to another world with different feel and architecture.  the beach is amazing with white sand and blue water and plenty of swimming pools to go around."
4,"The grounds and pool were excellent and stunning.  The slide kept the kids entertained all day.  As a person with allergies and coeliac, the options were surprisingly good.  Gluten free pasta, pizza, bread etc.  The chefs made an effort to talk to me about what they could and could not prepare and made the effort to make the meal enjoyable.  However in saying this, the food quality for a 5 star hotel could have been better.  The club rooms are not worth the extra in comparison to others around Bali.  The free drinks are limited and the club is open air and offers no respite from the heat or the mosquitos.    The room was a great size but there were issues .  Staff attended to some of these very promptly (constantly blocking toilet) but others were not fixed (the broken shower…"
4,The hotel is in my opinion the best beach resort at this price level. Amazingly relaxing. Big enough to hide from the rest and relax. Our room was simply fantastic. Beach probably the best in Nusa Dua. I had a little issue and immediately the highest level of management team got involved and took care of everything in the most professional way possible. If you can book a room at the grand club level. One department that needs improvement is Food and Beverage. The restaurants are not spectacular and little to over-priced. Sure the Japanese restaurant is good and the Indonesian buffet is ok as well but overall for such a fantastic five star hotel F&B outlets and offerings are not so good.

5,"We were lucky enough to get an upgrade on our room to a beach front suite. This was really Amazing. However, we have stayed here before in a standard King room, which is also gorgeous. The pools are truly unique - feel more like jungle rivers. Kids loved the slide. The Club pool is something else! This is more like an oasis pool, with overhanging Frangipani branches and rocky alcoves. Food is great (although breakfast very expensive). The resort is beach front, so you can sit by the pool or relax on the sandy beach. Hire a bike and cruise along the beach path to check out all of the other venues."
5,"My wife and I traveled here for our 1 year anniversary. This hotel is AMAZING, the views and staff are stunning! We couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The property is large and has lots of different restaurants. We loved the sea bass in the restaurant, and Japanese restaurant as well was amazing, give the salmon belly a try one of our favorite dishes on our entire SE Asian trip. The spa was one of the best I have been too don't skip the treatments they are worth it. We went for the buy one get one 1/2 off. Grand Club access is worth the upgrade, wonderful breakfast and the friendliest staff there is. The beach is clean and the water is of the deepest blue. Pools are perfect offering respite from the intense sun. Great location to launch your Balinese adventures. We…"
3,"We stayed for 8 nights using a Luxury Escapes Voucher. We found the staff to be not as helpful as other resorts we have stayed in Bali.  There was no communication between staff a lot of the time.  For example, when checking out of the hotel, we rang the front desk to collect our baggage and then when we arrived to get airport transport, our bags were not at reception as the front desk hadn't communicated to concierge which meant we had to wait for another 25 minutes for our bags to be collected (1 hour after initially ringing).   It was also difficult to book dinners at the restaurants as they were often booked out.  On one occasion, we arrived back to the resort at 6.30pm and tried to eat at Salsa's restaurant for a quick bite to eat.  There were at least 30 tables vacant at…"
3,Have to walk miles to your room in sweaty conditions. Definitely not a hotel for business travellers who have to dress formally. Garden Cafe food is rather bland when Balinese and Indonesian cuisine are so flavoursome.
5,"Upon entering this hotel resort, we were made to feel extremely special. The entrance and lobby areas are really grand and just what we were looking for.   We had an executive beachfront suite room overlooking the lagoon and ocean with a patio in front of the lagoon area. The room had a lounge and dining area, with a separate bedroom and two wcs, a separate bath and shower with seperate dressing areas. It was a perfect room😊  Staff were extremely helpful and welcoming.   One thing we would mention is that there were a lot of families at the hotel, which could be due to the location or size, so if you're looking for a quiet couples only hotel this is not what this is. This did not bother us so much except for the swimming pool areas which were always full of children but we…"

5,Although it is a long flight the trip is worth it. Bali is a beautiful island with the nicest people I have ever met. They are genuinely happy to help. The Grand Hyatt was a fabulous hotel set out like a village with beautiful gardens and water gardens everywhere. The rooms were spacious and cleaned every day. Plenty of hanging space but not enough drawers. Breakfast was a mixture of Indonesian food and western food. Something for everyone. . The pool area is fabulous and a hop skip and a jump and your in the sea.  The hotel supplies pool/beach towels so need to take your own. Opposite the hotel is a small shopping complex with lots of restaurants. The Aroma fusion was fantastic and it also had a bar. The staff were brilliant.  Nusa Dua is a gated community so you will need to…
5,"Long overdue review. We returned to paradise in April 2016 and once again in September! Thanks to all the grand hyatt staff who made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived! As always,service level is top notch! Resort is very well kept. Only downside during our trip recently in September is that there were irresponsible guests who left their trash strewn all over the poolside as well as along beach. It starts to be very obvious when you start to see remnants of trash washed up along the shoreline. Nothing too extreme, however,this was not the grand hyatt bali that I remembered when we first started coming here. Guests,please be more responsible!bring along a small bag for your rubbish!  To the hotel,kudos on a job well done!please bring back the poolside happy hour??…"
5,"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt with my family (3 kids) and we had an absolute ball. The hotel is luxurious, spacious, the service impeccable, the surrounds tranquil and peaceful. The breakfasts were decadent and delicious, and the restaurants were also fantastic.   We found an amazingly friendly, cheap and helpful taxi driver called Wally. His number is 081337061287. We highly recommend you use him to take you around to see the sights of Bali! He has a 7 seater private car as well as a metered taxi. He only charged us $70 for a full day trip (10 hours). We paid him $100 though as he was exceptionally friendly and helpful.   Would highly recommend the Grand Hyatt. It's absolutely fabulous! "
5,"Brilliant holiday, wonderful staff, great beds and pillows.  Pool good and the kids loved the waterslide. Grounds beautiful.  Food and drinks a little pricey so ate over the road at Bali Collection.  Massage at Kriya spa was amazing but just too expensive so got regular massages elsewhere.  Overall a wonderful holiday and would love to return one day."
4,"Spent a week at Grand Hyatt Bali. The hotel area is huge, one of the oldest it seems. Don't miss the beach with white sand and clear water.  There are plenty of restaurants within the hotel, room service is good.  "
5,Although it is a long flight the trip is worth it. Bali is a beautiful island with the nicest people I have ever met. They are genuinely happy to help. The Grand Hyatt was a fabulous hotel set out like a village with beautiful gardens and water gardens everywhere. The rooms were spacious and cleaned every day. Plenty of hanging space but not enough drawers. Breakfast was a mixture of Indonesian food and western food. Something for everyone. . The pool area is fabulous and a hop skip and a jump and your in the sea.  The hotel supplies pool/beach towels so need to take your own. Opposite the hotel is a small shopping complex with lots of restaurants. The Aroma fusion was fantastic and it also had a bar. The staff were brilliant.  Nusa Dua is a gated community so you will need to…
5,"Long overdue review. We returned to paradise in April 2016 and once again in September! Thanks to all the grand hyatt staff who made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived! As always,service level is top notch! Resort is very well kept. Only downside during our trip recently in September is that there were irresponsible guests who left their trash strewn all over the poolside as well as along beach. It starts to be very obvious when you start to see remnants of trash washed up along the shoreline. Nothing too extreme, however,this was not the grand hyatt bali that I remembered when we first started coming here. Guests,please be more responsible!bring along a small bag for your rubbish!

5,"There is still so much to love about the Grand Hyatt.  It enjoys the best, by far and away, position on the beach at Pantai Mengiat. The design and style of the Lobby and bars are what I call old Bali Pavilion, warm wood, marble - largely built in the early 90s but I consider the ambience of all, including the gardens to be very pleasing, and its scrupulously clean for you OCDers.  The staff, as a whole, are helpful and gracious and always give the smiling impression they are here to please. I chose the Grand Club and being here for 10 days I feel I got to experience the best and worst of the place. The Club is beautiful in a simple, water pavilion way. You are surrounded by water gardens, resplendent with water lilies , koi carp, egrets, herons, ducks and all manner of fowl.…"
5,"What an amazing place, it was just picture perfect. So so clean, the gardens manicured to perfection. the service & the people working there where just awesome. They could teach many other resorts how things are done. We stayed 10 days but could have done 10 more.   It was a huge place but felt cosy at the some time. A great place for families, couples & we felt safe the whole time."
5,i like grounds around hotel and lagoons  ;-)  restaurant  OK  people very friendly ;-) i bean only 3 days ;-(  recommend for everybody !!!!  hotel very clean and safe ;-) cleaning lady   make very good job ;-)
5,"This was one of the most enjoyable holidays we have ever been on as it was so very relaxing. This was our 10th visit to Bali and was by far the best. We are almost 80 years old and loved the location of the Hyatt as it is directly across the road from the shopping centre, the Bali Collection. The hotel grounds are magnificent with wonderful swimming pools and there are ALWAYS enough sun lounges for everyone. We would recommend this hotel to one and all. There were many, many families with young children there and everyone seemed to be having a great time. The staff were excellent - so very happy and helpful."
5,"loved everything about the hotel, lovely rooms, beautiful gardens, peaceful area loved the location. Bali collection 5 minute walk away lots of choices for shop and restaurants great pools especially the slide pool our daughter loved it. will be back."

5,"We stayed here for a few days after arriving in Bali, before heading to Nusa Lembongan to do some diving.  I am always really impressed with how consistently Hyatt treats Diamond members. Upon arrival, we were taken directly to our Grand Executive Suite (an upgrade from the Grand Suite we booked) and were checked in from our living room. After a VERY long journey from the U.S. this was a really nice touch and much appreciated.  The quality and setting of the Grand Club were great, as were the breakfast and evening drinks and canapés.  All the staff we interacted with were incredibly friendly, we had a great time learning some Balinese from them (and I think THEY had a great time laughing at our pronunciation).  The hotels grounds were STUNNING and very well kept. There are a lot…"

3,"beautiful place , great position .lovely staff. just too dear to eat and drink .had to venture out of grand hyatt , lucky the bali connection is only a 5 minute walk. ,for shopping and plenty of places to eat ."
5,"The hotel buildings are impressive, however it is the vast tropical garden setting that really sets this hotel apart. The grounds, pools etc are like a tropical oasis. We upgraded to Lagoon pool room which was ground floor overlooking a vast lagoon where we enjoyed close interaction with wildlife. The setting did not disappoint. Restaurants and food on offer was of a high standard. Staff were always friendly and attentive. The room could do with a refurb, but was always clean and we did not want for anything e.g. there was always plenty of fresh towels, fresh bed linen, complimentary bottles of water etc. Situated on a vast stretch of beach, Grand Hyatt is an idyllic property. Bali Collection shopping and restaurants only 5 min walk away with plenty on offer. We have previously…"
4,"A truely stunning property from the main lobby down to the beach front. Friendly staff, though at times didn´t respond (or understand) the issue being brought to them. Not what you expect from a five star hotel. Also had the feeling the cleaning of the room was not done properly (obviously dirty towels not changed)."

5,Wasn't a cheap holiday but it all forgotten. The place was amazing. The distinct Indonesian/ Bali feel wasn't lost in what I would have expected at a Grand Hyatt resort and felt the layout and gardens played a huge part. Food and choice was extraordinary and the resort was generally maintained  well. Staff were attentive and helpful. A more sympathetic place to visit since the Bali bombings. Great holiday which will often be talked and looked upon with happy memories by the entire family.
3,"First of all the Grand Hyatt has amazing grounds, full of tropical plants and lagoons. The service is also outstanding, everyone from the house keeping to guest services greet you with a friendly smile. Some of the downsides is the pool is sometimes a few degrees to warm, not making it refreshing. The amenities are not so good compared to other hotels around nusa dua for example not having any activities near the pool area like table tennis etc. The rooms are old with marks and dated furniture, though the bed is very comfortable. The food is ok with 4/5 different restaurants and daily buffets breakfasts, nothing to rave on about. The Kriya Spa was disappointing as the massage was average and didn't offer and buggy service. Overall I would definitely stay in another resort in…"
3,"We spent 10 days at the Grand Hyatt in Bali, Grand Club. The pool was crowded with guests that did not stay at the Grand Club. We were looking for space and quiet but it was crowded and seats were hard to find. The staff did not remember you and constantly asked for your room number. The club also allow kids under 12 so it can be noisy during cocktails and not suitable to someone that wants quiet. Food and beverage offering was good but birds constantly eating off the tables. Beach was nice. Poor service around the pool. Our stay was disappointing in comparison to many other great experiences we have had at Hyatt resorts."
2,We had the family above wake at 5.30 am every morning and slam doors jumping around each morning. Many complained but the hotel didn't stop it. The first morning the security rang our room at 5.30 am and told us to control our kids. Not us as our kids were a sleep. Oops sorry rang the wrong room they said. We were forced to move to another hotel at our costs as nothing was offered. We had 5 rooms. We loved the hotel but the way it was handled wasn't professional. 
3,"Well it was nice n friendly staff hotel but i dont like the tastes of breakfast menu n meeting snacks.. the most horible things were brown water flow from wastafel and water flush closet.. when i called for help, the suggestions from staff couldn't helping me out.. so better conduct regular inspection for foods and waters.."

5,The pools give kids hours and days of enjoyment. Service is impeccable. Views and facilities are amazing. There is no need to leave the resort. There are tourist services and markets within walking distance.
5,"My husband and I just got back from a quick 3 nite trip to Bali to attend a friends birthday party. As a diamond member of the Hyatt group we were looked after so,so well.  The club lounge is exceptional, the room was fantastic, the pool area was quiet and beautiful. Everything was perfect. This is most definitely our happy place and we planned our next trip before we left. I can't wait to go back. "
5,"Well I am currently undergoing treatment for a serious illness called Ovarian Cancer.

From the moment of check in till the check out my stay was perfect. The is is spacious and clean. I got a small problem that it was smell of humidity. Even the hotel was busy they changed my room to another one with wonderful view. The service in the lounge was great. All people from the reception desk to the concierge to the cleaner team to the personal on the swimming pool and beach are wonderful, very polite always happy to answer and to serve.

3,Huge property and big Hyatt brand. But rooms need some refurbishment. My room was smelly so bad behind the bed and in the cupboard. Aircon didn't function well and setting was impossible. Reaction of staff was so slow so that the technician came first after 1day. They say they were so busy. Also wifi didnt work before we complained. Breakfast was good. 
3,Great location .more 3 star than 5 star.beer and wine way over the top with 10% tip and 10%  tax so more you spend the more top and tax you pay. Quality of food very good and views from hotel towards beach excellent. 
5,I stayed in Grand Hyatt Bali for two days. Very nice resort with warm welcoming staff with profesional Service provided.  Very nice and clean room with bigger day bed. Complete amenities set up.  Green and large garden surrounding. I Love it. Thank you for making our stay More enjoyable and memorable.  Regard Ary
3,"Noisy hotel with full of children, some rooms are on the way to exit where many people pass in front loudly early in the morning or late at night. Hotel permits late night checking i.e. 24:00 midnight that is awful. Also on our check in day, they could not provide room at 14:00 that was really unbearable after a very long flight. Staff at reservation desk are not experienced to make clients happy. If you go breakfast late, many items disappear as they are out and they are not replaced by the staff. I am really not very satisfied with this hotel. "
4,"Best hotel beach in Nusa Dua area, wide open spaces and plenty of room for everyone. Rooms are a little dated but very functional and clean. Hotel is vast and so you get the feeling that it is not to crammed in like you do at the other more modern hotels. Staff are exceptional. Restaurants were good with a wide range of food available. Greta pool for the kids."

2,I must say the property is very nice. However hotel beds were uncomfortable and me and my wife suffered from back pain because of that. The service at restaurants and poolside was very bad. The personnel was paying hardly attention and it was a fight to attract them to make an order or request. Frustratingly (even though we've tried all 3 restaurants that were serving breakfast) there was no day that we could enter the restaurant without being wait listed. The staff was unable to get even the priority straight to be registered in the wait list and on a number of occasions I had to remind that people were jumping the queue.  This is a big hotel chain and not a cheap hostel and I never imagined that we could face such bad service in a place like Bali. We go there almost every year…
5,"My two kids, ages 7 and 9, and I spent four nights at the Grand Hyatt and had a terrific time. The pools are heaven for the kids and we rarely left the pool with the water slide- they were having so much fun. That being said, we found Nusa Dua to be a strange fabricated place that was sterile of anything Balinese, so I suppose it was good that we didn't want to leave the pool. We found the food at the pool side to be overpriced and mediocre, but we tolerated it for the convenience. The room was beautiful and clean, and the bed incredibly comfortable. The hotel is conveniently located across the street from the Bali Collection, which is a great place to go for dinner. This was a nice vacation from our vacation in Bali, but it sure wasn't the heart and soul of the island that you…"
5,"We stayed here in September on a luxury escapes package which was great value and well worthwhile. Overall we really enjoyed the stay and I have highlighted below the good and not so good things about our stay.  Good: - beach is amazing, beautiful clear water and no rubbish while we were there, lovely sun lounges and plenty of them, nice shady trees, perfect for relaxing  - pools are great, lots of different types, our four year old loved the waterslide and spent ages going up and down every day - food was generally excellent quality from all of the restaurants we tried as well as room service. We had a number of meals included in the package and this was great as otherwise it would have been quite expensive to eat in the resort all the time - the gardens and grounds of this…"
4,The resort was excellent; however my room was a slight disappointment! Air conditioning was not efficient and the room needed various maintenance work. Breakfast buffet must have a wider selection of foods.  
3,"We went on a luxury escapes, and I think if they didn't have this deal going the place would be empty. The Grand Hyatt is massive like a mini town of its own , the grounds are amazing. We travelled with2 kids 11&9 yrs, so when we arrived we were put in our room, the rooms are reasonably sized but I just hate sharing with my kids so we upgraded to an interconnecting room - do this and pay for it before you arrive because even if you have it in writing the cost of the extra room they will charge you top dollar and US at that , we had been quoted $125 and ended up paying a lot more for the extra room.The rooms we were upgraded to   had a gorgeous outlook onto a pond with ducks and lizard, but the whole out door area is rotting and the fencing to the point of unsafe.

5,"We stayed here in September on a luxury escapes package which was great value and well worthwhile. Overall we really enjoyed the stay and I have highlighted below the good and not so good things about our stay.  Good: - beach is amazing, beautiful clear water and no rubbish while we were there, lovely sun lounges and plenty of them, nice shady trees, perfect for relaxing  - pools are great, lots of different types, our four year old loved the waterslide and spent ages going up and down every day - food was generally excellent quality from all of the restaurants we tried as well as room service. We had a number of meals included in the package and this was great as otherwise it would have been quite expensive to eat in the resort all the time - the gardens and grounds of this…"
4,The resort was excellent; however my room was a slight disappointment! Air conditioning was not efficient and the room needed various maintenance work. Breakfast buffet must have a wider selection of foods.  
3,"We went on a luxury escapes, and I think if they didn't have this deal going the place would be empty. The Grand Hyatt is massive like a mini town of its own , the grounds are amazing. We travelled with2 kids 11&9 yrs, so when we arrived we were put in our room, the rooms are reasonably sized but I just hate sharing with my kids so we upgraded to an interconnecting room - do this and pay for it before you arrive because even if you have it in writing the cost of the extra room they will charge you top dollar and US at that , we had been quoted $125 and ended up paying a lot more for the extra room.The rooms we were upgraded to   had a gorgeous outlook onto a pond with ducks and lizard, but the whole out door area is rotting and the fencing to the point of unsafe. The rooms are…"
5,Everyone at the grand Hyatt were amazing the staff where so friendly they loved our children and always took time out to stop and talk to them and even when they walk past there is always a bug smile on there faces within a hello. 
5,Outstanding hotel. All facilities above standard. Would stay again any time. Would be happy to recommend hotel to family and friends. The location of the hotels is great for families and couples who want to be away from the Kuta bars and night life.
1,"DON'T STAY HERE. Staff lovely, but in 8 trips to Bali this is the most we have paid and it is nothing short of pathetic. Stuff stolen, toilet not work, tv & wifi not working, management lie after lie."
5,"A great place with excellent facilities for all ages very well maintained gardens, sparkling pools, excellent staff and good food .Close to shops and restaurants which are within walking distance. probably the best place we have stayed at in almost 60 years of travelling."
4,It was my first time in bali. I was with 2 friends from Jakarta. We stayed here for 5 nights. It was a blast for all of us. Best food. Best service. Best every thing. The price was great. The view was great. I did not like the extra security going in and out of the hotel. At night you feel that you are in a big jungle far away from humanity. So try to stay less than 4 nights and change hotels. This spas in Jakarta are better but the balinisian massage is also very good in bali. In general this hotel is on of my best hotels in Asia. Have a great stay and best regards. Dr SD 2016.

5,"All that you could wish for in a most relaxing and caring environment.  Staff not intrusive but always smiling and helpful.  The facilities were excellent and resort located within walking distance of local shops etc so had freedom to explore more of the local environment.  The provision of massages, facials, pedicure etc of first class quality."
5,"Entrance to the Grand Hyatt was ""Wow"". The 42 acres that covered the hotel was very well kept throughout. We had 3308 which overlooked the lake and was a feast to the eyes everyday. The spaciousness was such that tranquility exists everywhere we went. An excellent resort by world standard."
5,"My husband and I recently stayed at The Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua, Bali for our Honeymoon. We went with our 4 month old baby. We purchased an 8 night Luxury Escapes package. From the time we were greeted at the airport by our driver until we departed the resort in our private shuttle, staff were always courteous, friendly and helpful. Guest services were always available to assist us with any enquiry or request.  We stayed in a Grand Room on the top floor of the South wing. The balcony had a peaceful view of the lagoon and it was quiet, clean and enough space for us and all our luggage (with a baby... this is a lot!). A portacot, baby bath and a gift of Johnson's baby products was available for our baby.We took a pram/stroller with us and found it was a lot easier to get around,…"
5,"Lovely hotel and very friendly staff. Some of the rooms and areas are a bit tired looking- I stayed here 20 years ago and some things hadn't changed, but I would still visit again! I think Pasar Senggol restaurant is a great idea- having a traditional Indonesian night market along with a show while you eat under the stars! The spa is also amazing- with private villas for your treatment! "
5,"The Grand Hyatt resort is in a very good location and lived up to all of our expectations, with a very good room, great beach and pool areas, and all meals at the restaurants were very good. The massages we had at the spa were excellent."

5,"This was our second stay here with a 10 day Luxury Escapes package. We used the same deal this time last year and we were so impressed we returned and brought 3 other couples with us. They were not disappointed.  The Grand Hyatt lives up to its name. From the time you are gonged in through the entry, the beautiful lobby area with the Persona lounge to the right and the ocean view beyond the water features and vast landscaped gardens, you know you are somewhere special. Every step you take, around every corner and wherever you go there is a sight or view to take your breath away. The rooms are spacious and we were located in the North wing, central to all facilities and the pool(s) of which there were four to choose from close by. The Kriya spa, fitness centre and all they offer…"
5,"Grand Hyatt was a fantastic choice for a family holiday.  It is very beautiful, meticulously clean and full of very kind and accommodating staff.   We felt very secluded and secure in the Nusa Dua area and the level of security at the gates of the Grand Hyatt helped even more.  The food was amazing.  The kids and adults alike enjoyed the many choices available and everything was prepared very well.  No upset tummies at all.   The lagoon pool and river pool were our main location for each day.  Plenty of space and chairs.  Staff always wandering around in case you need drink top-ups or whatever.   The kids loved the kids' club as well.  They didn't want to leave on the first day (after just a few hours there) and had fun on their second day. The spa was amazing!!  The waterfalls…"
2,"This is my 3rd stay there, arranged for a hotel transfer a week before. When we got to the airport  was greeted by the hotel staff. This is where it all went wrong. The concierge guy offered me a private car of his own if wanted for the week which I refused and said I was not interested. Then when we got in the car, I realised their services are now sub contracted by private cars. The driver would not stop offering me his service and trying to convince me not to book through the hotel as I would be paying more, this happend the whole journey until we arrived at the hotel. As we got there in the evening, I asked to book for a restaurant and was told that all restaurant are fully booked and only room service was the only option available. However, I contacted the Japanese…"
5,Just a stunning resort to relax at for a family holiday. It is hard to imagine a resort with more beautiful gardens and pool area. All the staff were so caring and helpful. I would highly recommend a stay at the Grand Hyatt in Bali.
4,"We booked luxury escape and wedding package plus upgrade beautiful hotel grounds disappointed with room as asked and extra for upgrade dine,t get that the room was damp with the air con and made everything damp in the room. The wedding package was very well organised and went smoothly on the beach. Food excellent in all restaurants. The hotel needs a bit of God and the rooms looking tired."

2,I select this hotel to spend 2 nights at Bali. I really regret to select this hotel and I don't recommend this hotel for stay due to the following reasons; 1- buffet breakfast doesn't have variety of food. 2- request omelet means staying on long queue for more than 20 minutes as there is only one guy making the omelet! Unlike other give star hotels where there are two or more making it and then brings it to your table. 3- coffee on the breakfast taste poorly. 4- I'm pretty sure there is no inspection on cleaning the room as there is a dust on the room I stayed on see the picture I capture. 5- Staff on the breakfast need a lot of hospitality training.  Overall this hotel is totally not recommend for stay.
1,"Dated and smelly room. Chipped ceramic, the luxury escape package was a joke. Private jacuzzi wasn't working, lies with the secret balinese pool being off the map, breakfast was the same disappointing one everyday with limited changes. The barmen had no clue how to make proper cocktails and blaming it on their pineapple juice!"
4,Gorgeous setting of the hotel and immaculate grounds and pools. We had a superior sea view club room but you were too low to see anything .  The rooms were slightly run down compared to what I expected from the Hyatt but the restaurants were brilliant and there was always a good variety .  There was an excellent shopping centre outside of the hotel with very cheap spas! So we spent every evening trying out different massages !  Great place to visit .. Hotel very good but have stayed in better .  
4,"We are a family of 4 (5 and 2 yrs old) and this is our first time staying at the  Grand Hyatt. First impression, i noticed immediately how old the hotel is, but upon staying, I began to appreciate this grand old lady beauty. The gardens are just amazing, the best I've seen, with all the animals living in it. The Grand Club lounge design is very nice and the staffs couldn't be more nicer. The variety of food is not that much but adequate. The pools are amazing! They have one big slide that's pretty long like the one in the waterbom. Room was spacious and everything was in working order. We had a nice holiday and don't mind coming back"
5,"We purchased the Luxury Escape package at The Grand Hyatt at Nusa Dusa in Bali. We were a bit sceptic, but we stayed another two days for which we had to pay the full rate because we liked it very much. The Food at all the different restaurants was outstanding,the daily buffet breakfast well there was nothing missing.Our room was on the Ground Floor so we just stepped out to be at the Balinese pool one of many,the beach was also beautiful."

3,"Putting this review in context.  It is now 1:30 a.m.  Because I arrived in Bali at 3:00 p.m. following a 20 hour flight (with layover), I went to bed at 8:00 p.m.  I was awoken at 1:00 a.m. by the sounds of people talking and/or the television from an adjoining room, apparently local persons partying nearby, and the sounds of animals (frogs, crickets and/or whatever) from the very beautiful pond outside the patio in back of my room.  While I have been in many hotels with thin walls, I start this review with that problem only because I specifically asked for a quiet room as I was only going to be in the hotel one night as I had to leave early the next day.      Despite that initial issue, there is actually a lot to like about this hotel.  (The reason I am giving the hotel only…"
4,We had a good stay here as a family with two 3 yr olds. The hotel was welcoming to families but there was only one restaurant which was really suitable to take them. There was also only a very small toddler pool which was shallow enough for them to use by themselves. The resort is very big with lots of facilities and a short walk to Bali Collection
5,"Fantastic resort,facilities,entertainment,food - we could not fault it whatsoever! We are going to start saving to head back next year. Was very sad to leave..everyone is so friendly and it's less than 5 min walk to Bali collection for cheap food and drinks ."
5,"We returned yesterday from a weeks holiday at the Grand Hyatt. I have been to Bali numerous times and was a bit worried that the Nusa Dua area might be a bit quiet but instead it was a  lovely area. The hotel was fabulous in a beautiful Balinese setting. All the staff were attentive and caring .  The Luxury Escape extras  were all great . We enjoyed every meal plus the cocktails and  massages etc.  We still went over to Legian / Seminyak a  few times for shopping , surfing and dinner but that was all pretty easy . We had the room that looked over the Balinese pool and that was very pleasant and nice to have a quieter pool to spend time around.  I can't fault anything about our trip and we certainly feel we had a relaxing holiday."
5,"We were unfortunately very sick with colds from a harsh Melbourne winter when we arrived at the Grand Hyatt. We thought our stay would be miserable however we had everything we needed at the resort and turned a potentially bad holiday into a fantastic one. Set on beautiful beach Nusa Dua beach with 5 swimming pools, Spa, restaurants and shops, my husband & I could rest & recover on lounges under beautifully manaicured trees, while watching our 10 year old daughter play amongst other children & families at the water slide pool. We had massages at the Spa and our daughter loved the Spa-riffic Mini Me massage.  It was nice that she could join my husband & I instead of us going separately or organizing a babysitter or kids club. The resort restaurants were varied with food and…"

4,"It's still got the hotel chain vibe going on but it's a great hotel. I really liked it. Peaceful, friendly, relaxed. Great for pools, reading on the beach and simply recharging. There's a lot of families but they can be avoided. Shops nearby are handy. "
4,"Stayed here in October 2015 and had a wonderful time. The location is great as it is in a gated community and surrounded by other 5 star hotels. The gardens and road in the gated community are clean and well maintained so it make for an enjoyable walk. The hotel itself is huge, I think I counted 5 swimming pools which are connected together and surrounded by rock formation and bridge which make for a interesting swim. Also the kids loved the kiddie pool and the slide. If you get sick of the pool the private beach is literally next door and because it is so close the hotel staff will still serve you while you are chilling out on the sand. Food was also great, good spread for breakfast and the hotel restaurants a very good, drink are a little expensive but you can get them from…"
1,"First of all. I have a hyatt gold passport membership. I've been to so many hyatts around the world including park Hyatt, grand Hyatt and Hyatt regency   I am stuck at this hotel. This is literally the worst Hyatt I've ever been to.  1-The rooms are so filthy and outdated. It would be ok if they were just old but clean. Unfortunately that is not the case. Please refer to the pictures I have taken for the rooms. We found a long red worm in the bathroom and two lizards in the room within few days. When I called the deputy manager to complain, He said this is a tropical island and the are not harmful!!!!!! 2- Concerge are useless. Good only to translate for you and book you specific event or restaurant that you choose. They wouldn't recommend anything outside the hotel and they…"
5,"Couldn't more highly recommend our stay there. Food, facilities and rooms were top notch for parents and young kids/ toddlers. Having the Bali collection across the road meant that we could easily leave the resort without any epic family journeys with toddlers. Couldn't more highly recommend."
4,"The location is absolutely beautiful...few meters away from the beach and lovely, the vast property with the various pools and the various location for breakfasts helps to lessen the crowded resort.   The staff from check in, at the pool. at the concierge very helpful and attentive.   However, i may add the room door and the rooms look dated, they need a makeover and a desperate one for the other resorts like W, or Mercure or Ritz Carlton have far better and bigger rooms..apart from that, the property is worth a visit and must for families."

Upon arrival, Wendy greeted me showed the ropes and answered all my touristy stupid questions very patiently, was always there to help and had given me a phone to call.  I would highly recommend to just unwind either as a couple or family in the villa and enjoy the villa as everything is at a distance and one would need some transportation and patience to get where you want to, the in house breakfast and the food is well prepared, there is a day wise menu. The staff is very courteous, smiling and helpful, always willing to help.   I hired the driver Wayan who came to pick me up from the airport,…"
5,"Stayed in the Hyatt for 4 nights at the end of our recent trip to Bali - and it was the best choice we probably made during our vacation.  To be frank, the Grand Hyatt is not cheap at all - but it is well worth the money. With ample space in the room and an extra large king size bed we could stay with 2 adults and 2 children easily without feeling cramped. Rooms are apparently a bit older but in excellent condition and super clean.   We enjoyed the Grand Club privileges which gives you access to a free continental BF (loved the selection of freshly baked bread!), non-alcoholic beverages & cookies during the day and the typical evening hors d'œuvre bteween 5 and 7 pm. The variety & quality of snacks during that time was really good and especially the kids didn't feel any need for…"
5,Holliday at the Gran Hyatt resort was everything you could wish for. The rock swimming pool is amazing with attentive staff.with the help of staff we went on day trips to to the surrounding country side. I also had a Balinese massage at the spa by Maria... The best 
2,The room was far from the lobby because I had booked on an aggregator site.paid for a kings bed but got 2 twins put together.  Had a few nights of uncomfortable sleep. Toilet had stains and bathroom water wouldn't drain quickly. Room service was slow. Pools did not cater for children less than 1.3m
3,"I was disappointed with the Hyatt Bali Nusa Dua, the hotel needs a refresh. Rooms are not well maintained and extremely humid. You can feel the bed sheets and pillows damped. The food service is not to the level of a 5 star Hotel in Asia."

The staff is very courteous, smiling and helpful, always willing to help.   I hired the driver Wayan who came to pick me up from the airport,…"
5,"Stayed in the Hyatt for 4 nights at the end of our recent trip to Bali - and it was the best choice we probably made during our vacation.  To be frank, the Grand Hyatt is not cheap at all - but it is well worth the money. With ample space in the room and an extra large king size bed we could stay with 2 adults and 2 children easily without feeling cramped. Rooms are apparently a bit older but in excellent condition and super clean.   We enjoyed the Grand Club privileges which gives you access to a free continental BF (loved the selection of freshly baked bread!), non-alcoholic beverages & cookies during the day and the typical evening hors d'œuvre bteween 5 and 7 pm. The variety & quality of snacks during that time was really good and especially the kids didn't feel any need for…"
5,Holliday at the Gran Hyatt resort was everything you could wish for. The rock swimming pool is amazing with attentive staff.with the help of staff we went on day trips to to the surrounding country side. I also had a Balinese massage at the spa by Maria... The best 
2,The room was far from the lobby because I had booked on an aggregator site.paid for a kings bed but got 2 twins put together.  Had a few nights of uncomfortable sleep. Toilet had stains and bathroom water wouldn't drain quickly. Room service was slow. Pools did not cater for children less than 1.3m
3,"I was disappointed with the Hyatt Bali Nusa Dua, the hotel needs a refresh. Rooms are not well maintained and extremely humid. You can feel the bed sheets and pillows damped. The food service is not to the level of a 5 star Hotel in Asia."
4,We stayed for 10 nights and had interconnecting rooms which worked well for us as a family.  The public areas and gardens were absolutely beautiful but the bedrooms &bathrooms are slightly tired and could do with some refurbishment.  The Watercourt was a lovely setting to eat breakfast and we preferred that to the Garden Café which felt a little bit like a cafeteria.  There was plenty of choice for breakfast with a large choice of both Asian and Western style food.  The staff at the hotel were without fail polite and always smiling and helpful.  The food and drinks were expensive but this was only to be expected within a resort area.  The hotel suited us but if we returned we probably wouldn't stay in the Nusa Dua Resort area as having spent a few days in Ubud beforehand it felt…
5,"We stayed here for 4 days and these are the things i love about grand hyatt..  1. Hotel Staffs are so kind and respectful. They treat each and every guests special.   2. Bali Collection is right infront of the hotel. You can shop for souvenirs and groceries, eat good food and even catch pokemons..:D.  3. Waterblow is just few minutes walk from the hotel. You can even rent a bike to go there.  4. Swimming pool is warm and amazing!   5. Executive suite is very spacious. Great room for big family.  6.  Location is safe.. Security is very tight.  I've been to bali three times. Stayed in kuta, Ubud and Nusa Dua. Will recommend Nusa Dua if you want to have a relaxing stay.  Will definitely come back in Grand hyatt:)  "
5,"We came here for 8 nights on luxury escape package.  Excellent value!  Our kids 6&8, absolutely loved this hotel.  It's like paradise!  The grounds are stunning with an amazing pool area.  Kids loved the waterslide.  All food and drinks were amazing.  Staff were very courteous and friendly.  Would highly recommend!"
5,"Could not fault it. If you want to relax and eat great food, friendly/warm staff could not find better. Plenty of pool space and you can get a driver to go to the BUSY areas if you want a bit of chaos, otherwise quiet and relaxing place."
5,We are here with 2 kids (8&4) and we are having the time of our life. Upgraded to Emerald view pool and it is just perfect. Very calm hotel with choices of different pools. Food is spectacular especially brekky!

5,"I always ask the staffs how long you had been working with this hotel. All, most established Hyatt, the majority answer are 15years and above, you are sure the services are great. This is what I can describe about Grand Hyatt Bali. GREAT."
5,"We were invited to a family wedding in Bali and when Luxury Escapes post The Legends of Bali - Grand Hyatt offer it sounded too good to miss.  We did our research on Trip Advisor and everyone who had used this package were very positive so we booked.This package should be called the ""Amazing Legends of Bali"" as we could not believe the luxury of the hotel and the quality of inclusions. The rooms, the gardens, restaurants and bars where enhanced by the friendliest staff I have every encoutered in a hotel.   It was every thing and more than we expected and we highly recommend it to anyone contemplating a visit to Bali. You will not be dissapointed."
4,"vast option of activities and facilities, very clean hotel despite rooms needing an renovation. staff are very friendly and helpful. this is a great choice for family travellers with kids. good wifi connection for those of you who constantly connected."
2,"Our issue with Grand Hyatt wasn't so much with the hotel itself but with the horrible culture of Nusa Dua as a whole. In exchange for an amazing beach (and I do emphasize amazing) you are hit with absolutely insane food and drink prices across the board. I'm seriously talking $20 cocktails and $12 beers. If you think that is bad, you don't want to know what the on-resort restaurants charged for meals. The only safe haven was an off resort restaurant and shopping community called ""Bali Collection"" that is luckily right across the street from the main lobby. The meals there were more reasonably priced but were simple and bland. For breakfast we had no choice but to eat at the hotel's buffet. Not only was the food absolutely horrible but with the 20% fake government taxes they…"
4,"Stayed a week with friends.  Room was great, resort had excellent facilities for kids.  Our friends had children under 10 and they had a ball.  Evenings where a bit quiet for couples, some entertainment for us would have been great.  A nice safe, relaxing spot."

5,Safe quiet location. Beautiful resort with tinned of activity for kids. Kids loved kids club and wanted to keep going back. Amazing food. Beautiful rooms. Very friendly and caring staff. Will definitely go back
5,"An excellent hotel in a great location..Service is second to none as is the facilities..We've just spent our third trip there and will be going back again..The location is spot on with direct access to the beach and great swimming pools, with restaurants and shopping at nearby Bali Collection- just a five minute walk. Eating in the hotel is not cheap.Expect to pay around A$60+ just for lunch around the pool (2 adults 2 kids), from a rather limited menu.. Breakfasts are European with a large Asian selection.. The facilities and the people make this an ennoble trip. (Take a bottle opener with you- there's none in the rooms and they'll charge you $5 for the use of one ).."
3,Stayed 3 days after being in the hustle and bustle of Seminyak. Room was extremely nice and spacious and reasonably priced. Beautiful gardens and beach but pools could be better. Monitor Lizard swam past on day 2. No in pool bar. Food and beverage prices are very much on the high side with some restaurants way over the top for value. Great for a do nothing relaxation holiday as long as you have a fat wallet! 
5,"Stayed here on Eid Mubarak with my family. Hotel with good maintenance, full of family entertainment. The pool is huge, the kids activity was fun, breakfast excellent with good taste, room comfortable for parent with 2 kids under 12 years old bed size very big. Will stay here again if i visit Bali."
5,"Generally all hotel in Nusa Dua area is very good. But this hotel in my view is very big. I often loss my way in getting in & out from my room to the lobby. But if you enjoy jogging, this hotel is definitely for you. Ask for southcourt as it nearer to the beach & better view as well.   Spend 3D2N here, feel like the time is frozen, Enjoying the sunset & sunrise. Perfect for couples & families.  Room space is generous, good for small family trip. Breakfast could have been better, as the spread is pretty limited in my view. Gym here is pretty good as well although the treadmill here is pretty limited. But hey why bother, I recommend go jogging around the beach area, there's small park for you to jog around and enjoy the priceless view.  They also have kids club activities here,…"

3,"Very large hotel on the surface, old concept really needs to be renovated. Grand Club room and bathroom concept old and not pratical. Room decoration very basic.  Do not deserve is 5*. Btw excellent service at the Grand Club but with a buffet of 2 * hotel.  Disappointing."
5,"This is a busy resort hotel - seemed huge to us, but far from impersonal thanks to the friendly staff, many of whom went out of their way to chat and make us feel at home. Incredibly well organised and beautifully designed. Excellent facilities - the pool at the fitness centre has to be my favourite pool of all time. But in August there are plenty of families enjoying vacations, so there are lots of little people running around, having a good time and sometimes making too much noise. We had a lovely room with gorgeous ocean view, but the soundproofing was very feeble and we could hear voices and other noise from various directions. The cuisine was OK but not very special. It's a long way from home, but we'd go again if we could!"
5,Grand Hyatt always maintains its reputation by giving almost everything at the property. It has got all the great amenities and a beautiful beach adjacent to the hotel. One can walk to the beach from the room in less than 2 minutes. Very friendly employees and a huge property covering almost twice the size of any other resort. Definitely recommended to everyone. 
5,"Spectacular property in a stunning setting. The hotel is one of the older hotels in the area and is very gracefully laid out over large, beautifully landscaped gardens on a gorgeous beach. The service is second to none in every way and the combination of the setting and the amazing hotel staff makes this a top drawer destination. The reef protects the beach and swimming is fun, especially at high tide; the pool is great for kids and the restaurants we tried were good. Take a hotel bike to go snorkelling/kite surfing/etc at Benoa Bay; visit Uluwatu, go to Ubud and take a trip to Kuta. You will have a blast. If you want glitz and everything brand spanking new - then, this hotel is not for you. If you want a really superb very memorable experience with a touch of Bali, the Grand…"
4,"Stayed at Grand Hyatt Bali for 7 nights in June with my partner and 2 sons (Aged 1year and 5 years).  After a very long journey from UK to Bali - Arrived at night time, check in was very quick, swiftly taken to our room, we ordered room service, which was not only served within 15 minutes, but also tasted amazing.  Breakfast was very busy - usually between 9.30-10.30 - though they were really good with keeping it open to ensure every guest in the restaurant was fully fed!!  Coffee was hit and miss if you got it - and when you did - it was amazing!  Great tasting coffee!! Our room was exactly what I expected, the resort itself is pretty huge - rooms are very spacious and with a nice view of the gardens.  The resort is constantly being maintained which is a must for a place of…"

The Beach is clean and changes depending of the tide, some days was nice for swimming, some others not so good, lots of lounge chairs at the beach.  All the staff is absolutely wonderful, specially the staff at the Club Lounge, amazing ladies and gentlemen so attentive and friendly, they help us so much to accommodate our vegetarian diet. We did appreciated very much all their efforts, we will miss them very much. Thank you so much to all!!!  The maintenance of the grounds and rooms are impecable, after being for few weeks traveling in Indonesia I will say thumbs up for Hyatt.  The Bali…"

Beautifully landscaped gardens and very well maintained. Very friendly and helpful staff, with excellent room service replacing free bottled water twice a day!  Overall, a great holiday in a beautiful resort.. somewhere we are very likely to return to!"
3,"There's nothing really wrong with the place if a resort is what you are looking for. The rooms were clean, the staff was friendly, and the facilities were really nice.  It's a good place for travelers that would rather relax and lounge by the pool/ocean or have families with young children that you can have run around the premises.  It wasn't a good fit for me because I like to do a fair amount of exploration while traveling. Unfortunately, I didn't know that Nusa Dua is basically a resort town, with just a bunch of resorts and nothing else. You have to buy everything at resort prices and you can't really walk elsewhere since Nusa Dua is off on its own.  In short, I felt like I didn't vacation in Indonesia when I stayed here. It felt like any other resort I can find anywhere…"
4,"Our recent stay at the Grand Hyatt at Nusa Dua was fantastic. The whole place is geared to relaxation. The setting is fabulous, the staff were so friendly & efficient and the food was just glorious. The rooms we had as part of our Luxury Escapes package were ground floor and generous in proportion. (Only glitch was the slow drainage in the shower in our room. To my knowledge we were the only room of four that had a problem.)  As in any resort, the meal & drink prices were a bit high: so maybe some thought to a more family priced eating area would be welcomed. We countered this by going offsite for some meals. Overall a fantastic stay. Would definitely recommend. "
5,"This is our 5th trip to Bali and so far, Grand Hyatt Bali is our favourite accommodation. Perfect for a family with small kids because it's literally like a village so you have everything you need close by. It's not cheap by Bali standards, but if you want no fuss and can afford it, it's awesome. We'll be back for sure."

A couple of days after arrival we had a leak from the ceiling in one of our rooms and damaged our clothing hanging in the wardrobe. They were kind enough to have our laundry washed and moved us to another two rooms.  Second rooms and the kids room was infested with ants!! Around the bed, window etc. we had to spray regularly to stop this happening. Not good enough.  Our room had things crawling in the walls. Big cockroaches found more than once in the room and at night you could hear the walls moving. Very creepy and couldn't sleep. Very disappointing.  Their excuse it's a tropical island!! Yes it is!! But we stayed 6 weeks in Bali and no other resort or villa…"
5,"The Grand Hyatt , Bali , awesome place to stay as a couple , make sure you take in the sunset from the bar on top of Salsa Verde , little slice of heaven right there on the roof . The hotel is also great at organising activities for you - we went jet skiing and was a hassle free experience all organised for us. Also the acoustic band plying in the lobby bar at night added a great experience"
4,I went there to visit my friend. The rooms were damn good. It has a good assess to the beach. The swimming pool and the lobby is mesmerizing. one can enjoy the whole day at the poolside doing sunbathing. Food also is good. I feel it's a perfect place to go with your family
4,"Another experience with Luxury Escapes holiday and again we weren’t disappointed. The package itself included many extras and was great value even though we were in the high season and a surcharge applied to the room.  Be aware, additional food or drink bought in the hotel are at the usual high costs expected with hotels in Nusa Dua (so visit the local supermarket and restaurants if you wish to save money).  The room provided was on the ground floor and overlooked a small lagoon (pond), containing lilies and Koi, with the ocean as a backdrop. For a little extra we moved to the 4th floor with much better views of the ocean. The room had huge king-sized bed and a day bed recessed into the wall with a window outlook. Bathroom was well equipped.  Buffet breakfasts were included in…"
5,My husband and I made a last minute reservation at th Grand Hyatt for our honeymoon as our reservation at the Sofitel got cancelled with no previous notice. We were very happy to see that we got an even better rate and the hotel was much more than we expected. After our flight was delayed by 3 hours we arrived at the Grand Hyatt around 1am. We were greeted with a refreshing towel and welcome drinks. We were also upgraded to an ocean view room. The breakfast was very complete offering everything from omelettes to local dishes. There are several restaurants on site which might be a little bit pricey for some. Luckily you have the Bali Collection mall right in front of the hotel. You will find many restaurant options here at incredible prices (dinner for 2 for as low as US$20).…

1,"We were extremely disappointed by Grand hyatt bali as we believed they have serious management issue with no training to the staff  1.) On the second day of our arrival, we found out our room door was not locked after room makeup.  We have immediately reported the case to the room service and have received an apology.   2.) Make up service is definitely not up to standard - the staff can left cleaning towels and forgot the clean the bathroom 3.) there was seriously issue with receiption, prior our check in, we have informed the hotel that we are looking for high floor with baby cot prior our arrival.  We were being assigned to a low floor room at the very beginning as the staff has mentioned is fully booked.  When we were checked in, the room was definitely not prepared.  When…"
4,"We booked to come here for school holidays and had two rooms ( Grand Hyatt Club deluxe rooms) We booked this room type because we had stayed at Hyatt before and knew the standard of these rooms was great as well as additional extras like breakfast included and are wifi and also canapés and drinks, separate check in and  club lounge access. Its well worth the money upgrading your room especially if you make full use of the club lounge.  we were based on the 4th floor of the hotel access by lift and were given two rooms adjoining which is great when you have kids. The rooms were very spacious and I can only say the bed we had was so large we got lost in it , we have superking at home and this was even bigger.  All the usual mod cons and nice that even in bathroom little touches…"
5,"Stayed at the property from 9th August to the 19th August 2016. We staying in a Grand King Suite as we have a 9 year old daughter who wants her own space but not quite ready (in our eyes) to have a separate room yet. The Grand Suite offers a separate lounge and dining space with an area you can make into a day bed. We opted for a hotel collection at the airport which at the time is either 390,000 Indonesian Rupiah for a standard MPV (£22) or a luxury limo at 720,000 IR (£42)  With using a hotel car we arrived and didn't need to check in we were taken straight to the room. We found the room, very large, very well equipped with everything you need plus more. The hotel itself is very well maintained and laid out. The food is very good, breakfast is self service buffet with several…"
5,One of the best hotels we have stayed.The decor is excellent from the moment we arrived we felt welcome.There was free WiFi in rooms and in public areas.It was quiet  with no noise from the street and in an area which shouldnt worry any of the more nervous travellers.  overall I couldnt fault the hotel and would heartily recommend it to you.
4,"Very nice views and gardens designed with icons of bali culture at the beach of indian ocean that surprising you in arrival to this hotel but staff need to train more for this nice area to care more about the guests they seem lazy and their english speaking is poor , other issue which still question for me is , we had late night ticket from bali airport that we decide to make late check out that it is often in all hotel which require extra cost for guest to pay for that but when we ask the staff at reception to do so she said because the hotel is fully booked you should leave the room at the maximum 1 o clock unfortunately , but at the same time i was checking booking.com and i found many empty rooms for same hotel !!!!!"

5,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights and came away with a great experience.  Things were not as great for us as my wife fell and injured her back. The on site medical staff were absolutely wonderful in helping her get the much needed assistance that she required, even down to the loan of a wheelchair at no charge. The hotel staff were more than helpful in meeting our needs.  The food in all the cafes and restaurants were top class.  The rooms were well appointed and well serviced. Could not fault this establishment and if we ever return to Bali this is where we will be staying"
3,"We stayed for three weeks, booked well in advance, but getting two adjacent rooms was too complicated. Very differing levels of service by staff: Salsa Verde restaurant very good, Watercourt restaurant appalling. Still a good pick for people looking for a clean beach and sea (not so easy to find in South Bali these days). We stayed many times in the Grand Hyatt over the past 25 years, but service standards have been dropping. Also the visitor population has been changing over time, a significant part of the visitors now being Chinese tourists, staying briefly and being quite ""present"" in the hotel and restaurants Having a late flight back to Europe, I wanted to extent one room for another night (paid of course), but this was not possible ""because the hotel was fully booked"".…"
5,The Grand Hyatt Bali is a great hotel and if we go again to Bali will stay there. Location and surroundings were excellent. Staff were always helpful and friendly. Beautiful view of the ocean and beach.
5,"This was a great resort, beautiful property, amazing breakfast and excellent staff. Stayed here for 3 nights with my wife and it was just perfect!  The resort had a private beach area which was spotless and a great place to relax and unwind. After a hectic trip, I would definitely suggest spending the last two nights here before you head back home!"
4,I was expecting too much when I booked this resort. I was late check in about 7pm and the direction is not clear because it was just a little font on the wall and lack of lighting. overall this resort is great.

4,"Stayed here for the 2nd time. The 1st i had a beautiful sunken room. This time i was at the north block facing a pond. Nice too. The beach is always an ideal break from busy Kuta's. The pool is magnificent. Kids would have loved them. But i was there for work both times. At RM900 yeah a bit too steep but if was 700 i wouldnt mind forking out from my own pocket for a few days of relaxation here. Was on d deck chairs out at the beach and took up a leg massage offer from a Balinese lady there. That plus d breeze..it was heaven. The staff? Very accomodating and friendly. Arranged for a bike rent for me and settled the return willingly at no charge. With highway, kuta is less than 30 minutes away on my bike. Breakfast if decent. Better than many at that rate. "
4,"generally good experience: hotel condition is ok but somewhat dated.  can't get better room even thought a party of 3 diamond members!  food ok, decent, not extraordinary. so generally a good hotel, but not top rated."
4,"This was the fourth time we stayed at the Grand Hyatt, Bali. The last time we stayed there was 11 years ago. The hotel grounds are still wonderful and the pools are excellent for families. The beach was clean and relatively quiet although the sea was not ideal for swimming in due to currents etc.   Unfortunately the hotel lets itself down in two key areas. Firstly, the food is not great and very expensive for Bali. You can eat better food for half the price over the road at the Bali Collection. Secondly the service was not as good as we remembered and was very hit or miss. Our room attendant was very pleasant and always willing to please; however, many of the staff were not as friendly. We visited the Mulia Hotel for dinner and there was a noticeable difference in the level of…"

5,"We stayed here for our honeymoon, and immediately got off to a bad start. Checking in, the staff told us we had been ""upgraded"". As we had already booked an ocean view deluxe room, we were quite excited at getting an even better room! However, they gave us a garden view room. The ""upgrade"" part was that it was a Grand Club Room - anyone who books a room belonging to this Grand Club has access to the private lounge. However, we asked if we had access to this seeing as we were now in a Grand Club Room, and they said no.. So we were left wondering - no ocean view, no lounge access - where's the upgrade?! We only spent one night before complaining, and they moved us into the room we had originally booked.. Much better. Beautiful view of the beach and ocean!  That is the only problem…"

3,"Checked-in process was great. We being escorted to the room all the way. Our view was ""tennis court"" & the room was damped & smelly to my standard. Not to mention little old fashion... & very long way walk from the reception.   I called the reception & informed them about my situation. Thank god, they quickly found an alternative room which is the view was swimming pool & not too far either from the lobby. But this doesn't change the feeling about the room kinda of no character, old & outdated. Regardless, they keep it clean this one! No funny smell whatsoever.   The beach was super great, the landscape was most beautiful I've seen. My boy enjoyed so much kicking ball & running around on well manicured garden.

1,"I stayed 4 nights here, I have been to Bali many times, and I am a Hyatt frequent member.   This Hyatt Bali is very bad with many problems, and I am upset enough to demand a refund.  1) door key card does not work.  Broke down 5 times.  Each time I have to walk to lobby (100m away) to exchange.  Imagine how much inconvenience esp when you are in a hurry.  2) Under-staffed and unresponsive concierge.  The line to concierge is always engaged.  I asked them to get me a reservation at a hotel.  They promised to get back to me but nothing happened.  3)  Poor signage.  This is a huge property but there is no proper signage.  Its not easy finding one's way to the room esp at night when there are few staff at work.  4)  Room is getting old.  I woke up on Day 3 to find the kettle stopped…"
3,"I have never seen such a poor resort, the worst hyatt ive ever stayed in.   When we arrive, the walk to the room was far... Room is old and the towels are moist. No iron and ironing board in the room, i need to call and the response of the housekeeping is very snobbish like all other staffs in the hotel when i finally got my iron it was broken.   The staff is snobish uncooperative and very lazy.  I expect a 5 star treatment from a 5 star hotel but honestly i would rate the servise at 2 star.  "
5,"Had the pleasure of staying at this resort for 10 blissful days! The lobby and grounds are absolutely immaculate. Everywhere is so pretty! Room was nice, perfectly adequate for the time you spend in it. We were on a half board deal, breakfast was great, all you could want. We had a choice of 3 restaurants for dinner, menus don't change though so can get a bit repetitive. The staff at this place are lovely, nothing is too much trouble.  Spa is gorgeous, we had massages.. Bliss!   Only one moan... If you like a drink, be prepared to pay way over the top, especially for wine! Even at the supermarket in the Bali collection shops it was £29 for a bottle! Beer was reasonably priced here though.  If you are going soon, enjoy! "
5,"Was never interested in visiting Bali, too much bad media coverage. What an awesome surprise the locals are friendly, quiet peaceful people. Husband spoilt me for my 50th.With views ,gardens in flowers, Lilly's in the ponds, shaded pool areas. Friendly helpful service everywhere. Very relaxing break for 5 nights.. Hired a pushbike for 4 hrs and survived the streets.10/10 time"

5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali is located in Nusa Dua which is not an Island enclave but it feels like that when you enter through a security checkpoint into an environment of lawns, gardens, statues. Continue the drive through another security checkpoint into Grand Hyatt. This 5 Star Hotel is Balinese style set in acres of award winning gardens right on the beautiful cleaned and maintained sandy beach. We had two Luxury Escapes 10 day packages back to back, so 20 nights in total and we wish it could have been longer particularly when we returned to the cold and wet of winter in our part of Australia. The staff at Grand Hyatt Bali were fantastic and we cannot praise them enough. Beautiful hotel, great location fantastic staff and the Luxury Escapes packages gave us a really good deal."
4,"We had 10 nights here and left totally refreshed. While the resort is obviously ageing, it is still spotless and full of character. The gardens are beautiful. We had a couple of very small issues with our room which were dealt with immediately and rectified. The staff were amazing..everywhere..day and night. Buffet brekky excellent every day. The pool area was plenty big enough for everyone and deck chairs were always available. It was really convenient to have the Bali Collections shopping area just a short walk across the road, which had plenty of cheap eateries and shopping. The added security into the resort area and then into the hotel area was also appreciated. We would not think twice about returning to this hotel."
4,"Big kids about to leave for work, uni etc. So came to Bali for a 'final' family holiday.  The hotel is superb, lush tropical setting, nice large airy rooms, friendly staff and a private beach to die for.  Food is very good, but pricey, there is a shopping area over the road that offers more variety and better value.  Be careful on prices, there is a mandatory 10% service charge and 11% tax added on everything - so the price you see is not the price you pay.  This is not the hotel, it is true everywhere in Bali.  Other reviews mention queues at breakfast, this was not our experience, may have been time of year, the hotel was busy, but not full."
5,"Quite huge and clean resort. People are super friendly, especially the guy in charge the water activities, he even remeber my name at the first chat and used for next couple days. The beach was extremely clean with lot of greeny trees along, some ladies and men there selling stuff was nice too, they could talk in a day about their life and culture, all are interesting. An other part brought to my attention is room attendant, they seem to   pay well notice on you and get it ready in the next day gave the feel of being well taken care of you. Food and drink at all outlets are nice so I did not go out for dining but here at the resort. Definitely will be back soon. "

4,"Great resort, amazing staff. This is our second visit. Both occasions I have come back with stained swim wear from the pool which both occasions the pool staff tried to explain it away as my sun cream. I wear sun cream every where and this has only happened twice, both times at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. I hope next time I visit they find a way to correct the issue which i believe is the pool chemicals causing the colour in the rocks to leech into the water - which may stick to the suncream but this doesn't make it the sun creams fault - and what other option do I have then get sunburnt???  It has cost me 4 swimming costumes and 3 pairs of boardies - which aren't cheap! Other than that, I love the resort it is perfect for a family as it is a wonderful and safe environment with…"
4,My 4th stay here in 4 years. I visit Bali twice a year and the Grand Hyatt has always been a favourite. Arriving you are met with a stunning open vista across the well maintained gardens and lily ponds out to the ocean in distance. Checkin was polite and we were then escorted to our room in north wing. Rooms are getting on a bit now and while decor is a little plain and dated they remain well kept and spotless and appointed as you expect for a 5 star Asian resort. We did find the bed quite firm and after 5 nights eventually requested a mattress topper. Room service and housekeeping requests often look a while due to sheer size of resort. We requested ice one afternoon and when delivered they asked if we wanted every afternoon..yes please..so he committed to having it delivered…
4,"The resort makes you feel at home. The gardens and landscape was the beautifully done. Whilst the beach and scenery was good, care should be taken when going into the sea. Quite a lot of rocks and barnacles that may cut your feet. Signage and warning should be given."
3,"Bali is a beautiful country with wonderful people, delicious food, gorgeous scenery-- we will definitely be back but will not likely return to the Grand Bali Hyatt. The food at the restaurants was so bad (other than Grand Club and Nampu) and the restaurant choices so limited we had trouble figuring out what we were going to eat each day (this is almost never a probably for us!) I think if you're very mobile and plan on leaving the hotel for almost all your meals it should be fine but we have a four year old and had planned on eating at least half our meals at the hotel. The room we had was Club level, ocean view and a little beaten up and outdated. Pros: fun pools and slide pool for kids. Our room (and it seems like most of the rooms?) are within a stones throw of the beach.…"
2,Me and my partner stayed here for 7 nights. Having stayed at many Hyatt's i felt this hotel did not meet up to its expectations and there seemed to be one problem after the other.  Upon arrival we were escorted to our suite which was a great welcoming and a nice gesture of the hyatt. We were told we had an ocean view however it overlooked a small pond and no sea view like they stated. In the room above us there was a child who like to run up and down in the early mornings so we asked to be changed to another room. This room was spacious and did have an ocean view but there was mould on the ceiling and the balcony doors were very stiff and hard to open. The first three nights there were stains on the duvet and bedding and after day three we finally got clean bedding. The food at…

4,My 4th stay here in 4 years. I visit Bali twice a year and the Grand Hyatt has always been a favourite. Arriving you are met with a stunning open vista across the well maintained gardens and lily ponds out to the ocean in distance. Checkin was polite and we were then escorted to our room in north wing. Rooms are getting on a bit now and while decor is a little plain and dated they remain well kept and spotless and appointed as you expect for a 5 star Asian resort. We did find the bed quite firm and after 5 nights eventually requested a mattress topper. Room service and housekeeping requests often look a while due to sheer size of resort. We requested ice one afternoon and when delivered they asked if we wanted every afternoon..yes please..so he committed to having it delivered…
4,"The resort makes you feel at home. The gardens and landscape was the beautifully done. Whilst the beach and scenery was good, care should be taken when going into the sea. Quite a lot of rocks and barnacles that may cut your feet. Signage and warning should be given."
3,"Bali is a beautiful country with wonderful people, delicious food, gorgeous scenery-- we will definitely be back but will not likely return to the Grand Bali Hyatt. The food at the restaurants was so bad (other than Grand Club and Nampu) and the restaurant choices so limited we had trouble figuring out what we were going to eat each day (this is almost never a probably for us!) I think if you're very mobile and plan on leaving the hotel for almost all your meals it should be fine but we have a four year old and had planned on eating at least half our meals at the hotel. The room we had was Club level, ocean view and a little beaten up and outdated. Pros: fun pools and slide pool for kids. Our room (and it seems like most of the rooms?) are within a stones throw of the beach.…"
2,Me and my partner stayed here for 7 nights. Having stayed at many Hyatt's i felt this hotel did not meet up to its expectations and there seemed to be one problem after the other.  Upon arrival we were escorted to our suite which was a great welcoming and a nice gesture of the hyatt. We were told we had an ocean view however it overlooked a small pond and no sea view like they stated. In the room above us there was a child who like to run up and down in the early mornings so we asked to be changed to another room. This room was spacious and did have an ocean view but there was mould on the ceiling and the balcony doors were very stiff and hard to open. The first three nights there were stains on the duvet and bedding and after day three we finally got clean bedding. The food at…
5,"We stayed here for nine nights and all thoroughly enjoyed. On arrival, they offer you a cold drink and towel, whilst checking you in. We stayed in the North wing. The room was great. It was a good size and had everything you would need. The balcony overlooked an attractive pond. There is a good choice of places to eat and drink. Breakfast time was quite busy, but the staff are very helpful and they work very hard. Good choice of food, something for everyone. It is situated on a lovely clean beach and there is a choice of swimming pools. The slide is great fun too. The grounds are immaculate and a lot of effort goes into keeping it like that. The Spa is worth a visit too! Would definitely stay again. "
2,"This is my 6th time visiting the Hyatt and I guarantee I will not be visiting again. The experience and standard of the hotel has dramatically declined in comparison to my other visits. The service of the staff is very slow. During happy hour it took 70 minutes for us to receive our drinks, while other people were getting served quickly and before us. By the time we received our drinks happy hour was over. In the bathroom freezing cold water was dripping from a damp spot in the ceiling, it flooded the bathroom floor and soaked any towels and clothes lying on the floor. This issue was dealt with however we received no apologises or compensation. Our neighbours were a large, young family that often woke us up in the early hours of the morning and kept us up at night by laughing,…"
5,We have vacationed in Bali on and off for close to 20 years but this is the first time we've stayed at the Bali Hyatt in Nusa Dua.  It was a very wonderful experience - my wife didn't want to leave.  My daughter spent time on the water slide all day - she also went to the kids club for half a day and enjoyed her time there.  We also enjoyed walking on the immaculate beach and sampled all the five swimming pools.  The hotel was full but it never felt overcrowded.
5,"such a nice hotel with great staff , we spend couple of days in hotel and it doesn't need to go out at all . sea side and pool is amazing , lots of restaurant with high quality will serve you during your stay ."
5,"Grand Hyatt Bali is a big, sprawling resort in the government controlled resort area of Nusa Dua. The grounds are beautifully landscaped with tropical plants, ponds and waterfalls and it is teeming with wildlife-exotic birds, squirrels, frogs, koi carp, ducks and even monitor lizards. There are several nice pools including a 'river' pool that meanders through rocks and gardens and there is also a waterslide. There are over 600 rooms grouped into four separate 'villages' at the four corners of the property. There are several restaurants all with good quality food. The same buffet breakfast is served at several of them, though Watercourt Restaurant is the standout with its Balinese temple feel surrounded by ponds.The club lounge breakfast is very minimal by comparison. The hotel…"

2,"Some reviews quote the best hotel in Bali, I beg to differ. Upon arrival our check in was painfully slow, our first room still had the lingering smell of cigars, which was ""non smoking"" We were than moved to the most remote room in the hotel. The food was good, complex itself is beautiful, the staff on the grounds are kind and inviting, but it lacks serious management and communication. I wouldn't recommend staying here, compared too some hotels in seminyak, this hotel doesn't compete, every task is difficult"
5,"Wow, awesome resort.  Big pity we were treated like second class citizens.  Huge difference in 'cash' paying customer service and Luxury Escapes service.  Cheap holiday that made us feel cheap.  Totally not necessary and totally disappointing."
2,"very poor and bad support from the staff that does not care when you want to check in earlier or check out later. sometimes there is no other choice as it depends of the flight departure and arrival times. the staff globally does not care about the people and customers as the hotel is crowded and fully booked. I requested a proposal to come back for 3 days in September, I did not get it and the person sends me to internet, very poor marketing oh my god. There is a big issue in term of management here in this hotel."
4,"I'm a huge fan of the Hyatt experience. However, I feel that this particular property is simply too large leaving parts of it slightly outdated.   Pros: The spa is great, if you want a slower paced experience in Bali this is definitely a great escape resort.  Cons: The beach isn't spectacular, a bit far from the city"
4,I stayed here for 8 days on a Luxury Escape Package with my family of 5. We had two interconnecting grand king rooms. Everything in the package was offered. I was dubious leading in but I must say it was great value.  The breakfast was a nice buffet offered in one of three restaurants. My favourite was Watergardens. My favourite dinner was taken at the Japanese restaurant.  The cocktails were a nice touch and I enjoyed mine at the Salsa Bar. Don't miss evening cocktails up there. However the cocktails where very weak. Next to no alcohol!! The spa was awesome and the massage was great.  The rooms could do with renovating. Mine was a bit smelly.  My kids absolutely loved the pool and slide. I loved the beach. Would I go back??? Sure would on a luxury escape package.

4,"very family orientated hotel..If only the hotel will provide rest area for passengers who had to wait for the late flight. Like lounge and coffee and tea area and shower room, even though this hotel had provided shower in the Gym area, which was very much appreciated."
3,The check in time for this hotel is 2pm. I arrived at 3:30 and was told the room was still not ready. They asked us to wait in the lounge where they offered us a complimentary drink.  Unfortunately they only offered complementary non alcoholic beverages for making us wait.  It is 4pm now and I'm still waiting for my room. The grounds so far seem nice but they need to make sure rooms are ready by 2pm. 
4,We stayed on the resort for our honeymoon and checked in at 3am....entering the lobby felt like we have reached some fairyland. ..The ponds n water lillies  n lighting n decor was out of this world Place has lots of gardens n pools n is great if you are coming with kids. .They have a good day care n lots of activities....location in btdc nusa dua is best place to stay in bali if you are looking for peace n serenity. ..beach is good n you can swim. .. finding halal food was problematic. ..staff was a bit slow to respond but nice otherwise. ..rooms are also decent specially the sitting area in the corner
4,"The beautiful grounds are so big it takes a couple of days to get orientated but very enjoyable once you do. ( kept us fit) Booking in was slow but otherwise all staff were very obliging and went out of their way to get you whatever you wanted. Great venue for families and mature travellers. Breakfast choices and service was excellent .Close to all the shops, supermarkets, restaurants, etc. Had a great time. Only complaints -1. was that they wanted to charge me corkage for asking for a corkscrew in the room. 2. The room fridges are useless - I think that they have them that way to discourage cooling your own drinks. Had to keep requesting ice buckets."
1,"The worst stay I have ever experienced whilst on holiday, abroad and in any Hyatt property.   If you are in the market for a 5 star resort stay in the Nusa Dua area, honestly, book Laguna, The Westin or the Sofitel and receive the better and more genuine service and experience. The Hyatt are going through the motions and they are significantly over priced in every category compared to their counterparts."

4,"This is a lovely resort, the grounds are more like a botanical gardens. The resort is 25 years old and still very magestic, with some buildings needing some TLC. The rooms are spacious, with good facilities including a safe and a lovely shower. The restaurants are good but too expensive once taxes are added, however kids prices on the otherhand are good. You can go over the road at the Bali Collection where there are plenty of shops & restaurants to choose from. The breakfast buffet is great with 3 locations to choose from. Our favorite being Salsa Verde as they made the best coffees, it was also the largest and opposite the beach. The staff were all very friendly. Now the things which weren't too good.

5,"Where do I start with this paradise. From every angle to every corner this was by far the best hotel we have stayed in anywhere. We stayed in room 2103 for 10 days from 19 July 2016 and we were treated like royalty from the first moment. A giant GONG!! to announce our arrival to staff as a welcome. Welcoming drinks and cold refreshing towel. This of course, after our private transfer from the airport to the hotel. Yes, we stayed on an Luxury Escapes voucher but that did not affect the quality or the standard of service.  The staff were so so sincere, polite and efficient that it is of a level I have not seen before to be so consistent among so many.  Our room was superb and ventured out to a balcony with such serene views of green and a lagoon full of Koi fish. Not far from our…"
3,"I am a Hyatt Diamond member and stay 50-60 nights a year in different Hyatt around mostly asia, - The service at this hotel is not up to the usual Hyatt quality.  The Hotel itself is very good; great pools, nice gardens, beautiful beach, nice and clean rooms that are maintained well, good choice of restaurants ( but a bit overpriced ).  The problem this hotel has is unfortunatly with its service.  The worst thing for us was that they didnt care about severe allergy concerns when ordering food. My wife has a extreme allergy for all kinds of nuts, unless she gets double adrenalin shots and can reach hospital in 15 minutes, she would die. For this reason we always have a card with us that is written in the local language ( you find them at ""peanutkiller.com ). She always shows this…"

5,We booked the cheapest room of the hotel.  It was amazing! Spacious room with big bed and an extra place for relaxing. At the back of the room was a balcony with chairs and table. The bathroom was also big with all the stuff you need. Its swimming pool was nice. The hotel is in Nusa Dua and you have a direct connection to the beach. The beach is beautiful for relaxing and bathing. The breakfast was great!!!  The highlight of the hotel is the entrance and the main lobby....
5,"An outstanding experience, great service and food. Staff were friendly, helpful and accommodating. Comfortable room nicely finished, furnished and appointed. Great resort facilities, beautiful swimming pools, fantastic gym with complimentary stretch classes."
5,"Beautiful gardens and wonderful beach access, plenty of pool and beach lounges.   Nampu (Tepinyaki) restaurant is excellent.  5 minute walk to Bali Collections and other restaurants.    A wonderful relaxing stay."
5,WOW just got back from Bali stayed at one of the best hotels in fact the locals were saying it's the best hotel. So why is it so good starts with that smile that you are greeted with the checkin in was smooth the bags arrived on time. Staff at the grand Hyatt were excellent so friendly and helpful. If there was a bad point then that would be o just wish they gave us a room that overlooked the sea.   Great place highly recommend especially if you have kids lots to do is all I can say.   Bali collection directly opposite so loads of restaurants and shopping to do.   Book this place if you are going to Bali 
4,"We stayed at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua Bali with Luxury Escapes 8N voucher in a lagoon view family room. We had a great time with the main attraction being the 40m pool slide and a number of other pools (we travelled with 2 young kids under the age of 7).  Overall the experience was quite positive however the resort is starting to show its age and the rooms are a bit dated. There are a lot of resorts in the 5km radius (Sofitel, Laguna, Westin, Mulia, Ritz-Carlton) which are newer. The resort has easy access to the beach, 5min stroll to Bali Collection (shops, restaurants, Coco supermarket, money changer), however it's all 20% more expensive here due to only guests from nearby resorts visiting Bali Collection.

5,"What an immaculate hotel!!  We loved every minute we spent at the hotel in the Secret Emerald Pool rooms.  We had our teenage children so we got 2 rooms beside each other and it worked perfectly.  The restaurants and amazing, never seen a breakfast selection so huge in our lives!!  The staff were unbelievable, exceptional, couldn't get any better.  The grounds were amazing with staff primping and cleaning all the time.  The room was nice and cool, though the shower was a bit too cool most of the time so had to take showers at odd times of the day to get it hot.  It really was the most beautiful hotel that we have ever stayed in and we will be back :)"
5,"We stayed on a luxury escape voucher. Great value !!!! Staff were simply fantastic and friendly. Pools were great, we have a toddler and we went form pool to pool, quiet and also kid friendly pools. Food was great, but with out the vouchers it was on the expensive side for Bali. Great gardens, rooms were great. Free water everyday and rooms tidy and clean. Family friendly but also  a great couple spot. Away from the hustle and bussel Use the blue bird taxi if you want to go into Kuta etc. The Bali Collection across the road is a good spot to get essential supplies and some shopping.  All round a great experience, luxury escapes you are a winner, second time  and no problems."
5,"Everything about our stay was excellent. The staff and facilities were outstanding. The hotel design means there are many areas which give you the feeling of privacy, the pool area was very relaxing. Being close to Bali Collection was a bonus."
5,"Recently had a fantastic 10 day stay at the Grand Hyatt, would highly recommend it to anyone, from families with young children to those wishing for a quiet relaxing holiday. Plenty of space for everyone to enjoy with numerous pools and beach areas to enjoy. Nice beach, even got a surf in at the beach in front of the hotel, although was probably lucky that the tides were in my favour. Hotel staff arranged a number of excursions for our party from mountain biking, outdoor rafting and different outings such as a local family woodcarver, waterfall and tea/coffee plantation. Fantastic holiday!!"

3,Very  tired and noisey guest rooms. Guest rooms need some sort of anti slam device fitted as guest rooms up to 5 or 6 rooms away could be heard slamming doors at night. Beds are too hard. Poor quality food. Poor quality and expensive wine.. Beach and gardens are fabulous.
2,"We went to Bali as a family holiday. I expected the people at the hotel to be more friendly and welcoming. It's very rare to be greeted at the hotel, the workers aren't very friendly and they aren't helpful. We found 4 cockroaches in our room. After calling housekeeping a man came a sprayed the room. But with me being on top of them I had to keep repeating we have kids with us so to make sure the room is cleaned well after spraying.  The breakfast isn't great. The Indoor restaurant is much cleaner and welcoming than the outdoor one.   The pool where the big slide is isn't clean. We didn't allow the kids to swim in it.  Overall, I wouldn't go back to this hotel. "
4,"My daughters said it was the best hotel they have stayed in,it was beautiful the grounds were spread out and full of wildlife,I think most room overlooked the lake and we enjoyed sitting on the balcony watching the lizards a and ducks and birds.  The only fault was breakfast, I didn't think the 2 restaurants were big enough to cater for all the people they were always busy and seemed too crammed, not much space and although the waiters didn't stop I think they found it hard to keep up with the demand and I'm sure the hotel was not full as there were loads of empty sun beds around the pool. That is my only criticism Also the hotel is situated within a luxe hotel complex and just across the road was the collection A purpose built area of shops restaurants which were over priced…"
5,"Beautiful ponds and gardens and birdlife retain a tranquility and essence of Bali despite the rather large size of this hotel.Exceptional staff ,nice food and a wide sandy clean beach with recliners under shade trees complete the picture.Fun pool for the children with slides and plenty of space to avoid them if you want."
4,NIce hotel with friendly staff and still had that well balanced Balinese culture. We had a garden room overlooking the pond which was secluded and relaxing. Plenty of pool activity and decent gym. Bali Collection a 2 min walk from the hotel so easy to walk down for a meal at night. Hotel restaurants were good quality and varied menu the Japanese was especially good.
3,Very  tired and noisey guest rooms. Guest rooms need some sort of anti slam device fitted as guest rooms up to 5 or 6 rooms away could be heard slamming doors at night. Beds are too hard. Poor quality food. Poor quality and expensive wine.. Beach and gardens are fabulous.
2,"We went to Bali as a family holiday. I expected the people at the hotel to be more friendly and welcoming. It's very rare to be greeted at the hotel, the workers aren't very friendly and they aren't helpful. We found 4 cockroaches in our room. After calling housekeeping a man came a sprayed the room. But with me being on top of them I had to keep repeating we have kids with us so to make sure the room is cleaned well after spraying.  The breakfast isn't great. The Indoor restaurant is much cleaner and welcoming than the outdoor one.   The pool where the big slide is isn't clean. We didn't allow the kids to swim in it.  Overall, I wouldn't go back to this hotel. "

5,"excellent hotel, incredible staff, very helpful, super polite and always smiling, the grounds are a so well looked after, an army of staff are constantly keeping all areas in top condition, best hotel we ever stayed."
2,"A very nice property.  However, staff often make hotels what they are .  I have stayed here multiple times before and service has always been great and personal.  This time is was more of a factory and not very attentive.  Perhaps management has changed.  Will not be returning to this property despite being an elite Hyatt member.  There are too many other options in the area that will likely appreciate your business more."
3,"Our first trip to Bali and staying in Nusa Dua was a big mistake, it was too far away from the action and it was a pain having to taxi into Seminyak/Kuta/Legian/Ubud. This resort is STUNNING and the service is 5 star. Where they failed was in the food and drinks - hence why I gave them only 3 stars. They need to simplify their food choices and ensure that what they do offer is high quality, fresh and full of flavour. Too much inconsistency in mixed drinks/cocktails (they just didn't taste nice/unknown  brands)  and food that missed the mark for an international chain.  Also, you cannot swim safely on the beach -it's not a swimming beach.  There is lots of rubbish in the ocean and shore; it's disappointing that the resort doesn't have some sort of a clean up campaign. But then…"
5,"We have just returned from the Grand Hyatt and had a wonderful holiday there. The pools were a firm favourite with our children! The staff are very welcoming, warm and friendly. The resort has everything you need and is close to local shops and Waterbom Park which is so much fun. Excellent choice of restaurants in the hotel. By the end of our stay we were finding the food choices a little monotonous though. This said, there are plenty of restaurants locally to try out. Highly recommend."
5,"This place is truly amazing. Book it now, take my advice, do not hesitate. We stayed for 9 nights and are destined to return. Location - excellent, with pools next to the beach. The beach is great to swim and do un-motorised watersports. The hotel is 25mins to Kuta, and a close walk is the Bali Collection shopping centre, good for cheap meals and shopping. Very handy. Everything from brand name shops, groceries, to street traders. Rooms - clean, well laid out, and kept well daily. We had a built in day bed in our room. Cannot complain at all. And great beds and very quiet - we all slept well. Grounds - perfectly manicured, lots to see and do. Interesting layout that makes you feel on holiday, with people...but not people everywhere around you. A good mix. Food and drinks -…"

4,"For the first trip in Bali just my self, so exciting to stay long here because I got recommend about this hotel. Facilities, service and staff over all good excellent 👍 Wanna come back here again with my kidos 👪👫"
4,"This hotel has magnificent gardens and water features. It is teaming with wildlife - birds, fish, lizards, squirrels etc.  The lobby and bar areas are magnificent and the pools are clean and plentiful. We particularly enjoyed sitting in the shade under the trees both by the pool and on the beach.   Like most other people in this resort we were on a luxury escape package. The best bits - great breakfasts, very friendly smiley helpful staff, awesome cultural buffet dinner, great cafe, amazingly good spa treatment and the location. Rooms were large too. The waterslide is popular with kids.   The not as great bits about the luxury escape package - limited cocktail choice and they seemed to have minimal alcohol in them, special menus in the restaurants which had limited choices, no…"
4,"It was our first visit to Bali.We stayed with our 2 Kids at The Grand Hyatt on july 09-16.I must say we had our fantastic holiday out there. Beautiful Lobby, well decorated Rooms and there Entire Lagoon  Ambieance, every thing was as good As natural.  we usually had our breakfast at there sea front restaurant( Dont knw exactly the name)the Manager ""Ekky"" was very helpfull.Thank you very much Ekky for making our every morning cheerfull.  P.S. MUST Go for the family"
5,"Many people have commented on Trip Advisor that the Hyatt is looking a bit 'tired' and old world but for us, its Balinese architecture, 41 acres of magnificent gardens and its setting close to the sand and a safe beach is the essence of the 'old Bali'. Everything in the room and bathroom worked, there were multiple power outlets for all of our devices and the bathroom products and linen were in good supply and generously replaced daily. Many of the other shiny and modern accommodation in Bali is quite spectacular and we did check them out, especially the new Mulia Resort just down the road, but they are set back from the beach and depending on where your room is, it's a long walk to the beach.  We booked the Hyatt via a Luxury Escapes voucher for 10 nights in a Grand Room (Room…"
4,Lovely lobby and downstairs area - beautifully decorated and serene - that is until you get a screaming child walk past.   Pools were lovely but full of kids- would have been amazing to have an adult only pool or relaxation area.   Beach was beautiful   Rooms felt distinctly more 4* than 5. Our mini bar wasn't ever stocked up but Comfortable enough.   Excursions through the hotel were quite naff and tacky - they need to up their game in that department. When staying in a 5* hotel and paying the price we did to see and do things I expected much more than what we got.   Overall - 4* rating given because Bali is beautiful. I could easily and happily spend another month there. There are definitely better hotels in the same beautiful surrounding

4,"Ok, so just concluding a 10 night stay.... A Luxury Escapes deal. What can you say, the place is beautiful, magnificent gardens / grounds, a luxurious feel to the place. We stayed in East Village, ground floor overlooking lagoon. Room was nice, well appointed and everything worked..... The air con was great 😀 Wildlife abounds including some very big lizards, brought some excitement at times , bird life magnificent too .... Enjoyed watching a couple of kingfishers at lagoon tonight. Bars and restaurants were good, beer and wine expensive after they add govt tax ..... Helped to buy beer and wine at local coco supermarket ( Bali Collection is literally 50 metres from hotel main entrance with good choice of restaurants and shops )  Staff at GH were lovely, very helpful, always…"
5,"We stayed with our 2 kids at the Grant Hyatt last week. We also did the Luxury Escape thing. We had a fantastic holiday. For the positives I have loads: wow what an entry to the hotel, the view from the lobby is impressive. Gardens are immaculate colorful and so well maintained. Voucher deal was great, loads of extras including the best spa treatment in the Krya spa. Seriously amazing. Food was great, pools for the kids are huge. We bought one of the inflatable things for the kids that they used every day.  For the negatives: only noticed that the rooms we were placed in with all the other voucher people are the outdated ones. We had 24hr delay with our flights so we had to change rooms and were placed at the other side of the resort where the rooms were a lot more modern and…"
4,"Good family hotel, great pools and a couple of water slides. Nampu - The Tepinyaki restaurant was delicious, ate here twice, once in front of the the chef (gets very hot sitting there) and once in the main restaurant (much cooler & traditional seating options). Really enjoyed the food, kids enjoyed it too. The breakfast was good, pool staff disappeared at happy hour & all had a different version of the offers, some days cocktails were great other days just awful (though happily changed when returned). Food at the Italian was bland and terribly slow service on our second visit, 3 meals arrived one kids meal had to be sent back to be cooked, and the final meal arrived 50 minutes after the first ones, discounted that meal off but spoiled our experience as we sat for a few hours for…"
5,"We have just returned from and ll days in Bali staying at the luxurious Grand Hyatt.  What can I say, we travelled as a couple and we were made to feel very special all of the time.  The staff could not do enough for you and they always had a lovely smile. The food was very nice, something for everyone.  Our room was kept spotless by Juno and overlooked the ocean.  What more can you ask for.  The beach was Paradise.  We have been to some wonderful places but this hotel would take a lot of beating.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Wonderful memories."
5,"We stayed here on a Luxury Escapes package. The gardens & pools are marticulously well kept & the entire grounds are absolutely stunning. There were a lot of families with kids as it was school holidays. As travellers without kids we found it easy enough to escape for some quiet time to the beach or one of the smaller swimming pools where there weren't many, if any kids. There's plenty of shade at the beach or by the pool. The staff are amazing & obviously love their job, they are very friendly & super attentive, always smiling & saying hello in passing. The cost of food & cocktails is comparative to Australian prices so don't except a cheap holiday here, although the meals at all the resteraunts were superb with a great variety. Bali Collection is across the road if you're…"

4,"Good Safe, location, property is beautiful and amazing and sincere staff . The grand club staff was amazing. But that was our experience all over the property. The sort of sincerity which I haven’t seen anywhere else. Sri/ Miliana/putri  and Urip and all the staff were excellent.   Room:  Unlike what other people may say south village is not far from the lobby or Grand club  Bad Few facilities need updating like being able to check bill and checkout from room which is available at other Grand Hyatt Ugly The water in the pool is pretty hot. We were told that it may have been caused by a mal function.  Tip - South village has slightly dated but ocean facing rooms with amazing views. "
5,"What a beautiful hotel, on first look the grounds are just amazing, large ponds surround the area full of coy carp, lagoon style pools and lush greenery. The staff are so friendly and literally are there to serve you, I have never met more attentive staff.   The food is lovely, my favorite restaurant was Salsa Verde the Italian, serving pizzas, pastas and other meat dishes. Food and drink in the hotel is very expensive, everything is signed for and charged to your room and once the tax is added at the end you end up with a big bill! We tried to pay a bit as we we went along but overall everything is really dear. There is a shopping village just outside the hotel with lots of restaurants that are half the price so we ate out most of the time.   The rooms are lovely, very spacious…"
5,Beautiful resort surrounded by nature. We saw so many birds/lizards/frogs etc. Great for the kids.  Pool area is fantastic for kids and beach is awesome too.  Grounds are lovely. It's big so request you room wisely if you have kids with little legs.  Spa is amazing and kids club is lovely and light with great activities that incorporate nature.  Also good that breakfast opens at 6:30 because our kids are early risers. We comfortably had 2 adults and 2 kids in a normal room.  Highly recommend! 
4,"Lovely family destination, plenty for the kids to do, lovely walks along the beachfront paths to other resorts, fantastic restaurants with lots of food choices (kid friendly choices too).Easy walk to Nusa Dua village for hawkers shops, fantastic shopping centre right outside the resort gate for everything you might want from tourist trinkets to dep't store and restaurants. Gated resort, so felt very safe and comfortable. Staff were wonderful and very accommodating. pools were awesome, our package included breakfasts which was excellent."
4,"I don't want to make you despointed maybe it was my bad luck, but the room toilet was not good at all, wash basin was broken, water stay inside without drain! and flush tank was not working!  Staff was not the same as what we used to see at Bali, you feel that they are not happy! Kids club is payed per hour, some other hotels make it free.  the good side is the outdoor huge pool and the very nice beach and clean sand, setting area at the beach under jasmine trees is fantastic, at night you can walk outside to Bali collection (place where you can have nice dinner and shopping)  over all the location of hotel is very good, management need more care."

5,"We are a family of four with 11&13 year old. We stayed in West Wing 3256&3257 - interconnecting rooms. Great location each having balconies overlooking pond frequented by wildlife and stunning flowers. The rooms are large, well air conditioned and maintained immaculately. The beds are super comfortable and there is a large day bed in each room suitable for 2 persons to sleep on. The resort is vast and beautiful. The gardens are immaculate. Everything is clean. I would recommend including the Grand Club in your package as it includes free food & drinks from 5-7pm every day. Alcohol is very expensive otherwise. Bali Collection across the road has a supermarket for snacks & drinks at reasonable prices.  Kriya spa is awesome, treat yourself to a massage, it is expensive but worth…"
4,"Service was excellent from the minute we arrived at the security check gate. One receptionist staff stood by at the gate and once we informed our name, she had our room number available and informed the team inside that we were arriving at the lobby in a minute. Everything was well taken care of.  Dont worry about getting lost as the staff gave us a tour of important sites while ushering us to our room.  Breakfast was great, we especially loved the bread and pastries as those tasted marvelous.  Staffs at breakfast were also kind and helpful. They treat all guests equally with respect, be it foreigners or local guests.  Pools are nice and fun for kids and adults.  We also tried the Japanese restaurant, Nampu,  love the food, ambience, and the service was alao great. A bit pricey…"
3,"The garden was so butiful, but there was a long way between lobby and rooms. It was noisy at night becuase of voice of birds , that made me nervous.  The water of pool was so warm, it didn't make a good feeling after sunbathing.  Variety of foods was limited in breakfast , the main point for me was the lack of cheese.  One important issue that bothered me was request of cash from the hotel whether i went there via tour agency and there was no need to ask me for cash. The worse issue was that they asked me for cash in Rupiah and not also in Euro. "
5,"Used my Hyatt points for a club room that offers a day bed which the lovely staff covered into a proper bed for our children. Club room also gets you the Grand Club Deals - breakfast, teatime, evening drinks and snacks , which is a really good deal. Most of the nights we ended up overindulging in the snacks and had to skip dinner.   Staff at hotel are fantastic and really go out of their way to make you feel at home. Beach is awesome and better than most other streches around Nusa.  We are sure to return. "
5,"Awsome holiday in quiet location, we booked on luxury escapes with a 10 night upgrade and was not disappointed. The room was spacious and opposite the bali pool which was perfect for my kids.also the main pool with water slide kept them busy for hours.plenty of eating options across road at bali collection.The deal was such great value that i have purchased another and will be back again."

The room was spacious and opposite the bali pool which was perfect for my kids.also the main pool with water slide kept them busy for hours.plenty of eating options across road at bali collection.The deal was such great value that i have purchased another and will be back again."
5,"Very nice hotel with al service facility , i enjoy my staying  , i try surfing on the ocean , very good view from my balcony and there is bali collection near to hotel a lot of resturant and shopping , the pool is very good and also the breakfast in the beach was awesome  "
5,We travelled 4-12 July to Bali as a family 2 adults and 3 kids (9-14yrs) and stayed for 8 glorious nights at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua.  I bought a Luxury Escapes deal and was a bit sceptical especially after reading some other reviews where people wrote they had problems in checkin or there was construction nearby.  I was very happy to find out that we never experienced anything remotely like that and every possible aspect of the stay exceeded our expectations.  The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating - even bringing us peanut butter sandwiches at 3am while we were watching the Euro soccer finals!  There was no construction going on at all and everything was very peaceful and tidy.  The gym and adults pool/sauna/steam room area is magnificent and their spa is…
5,"Also a luxury escapes visitor we thought the hotel was spectacular, yes the rooms are a little dated but they are clean, comfortable & well appointed. The age of the hotel however allows for amazing sprawling gardens providing coolness & shade which is a huge bonus. We saw large lizards, squirrels, lots of fish & birds.  We asked for a ground floor room & were at the rear of the complex by the spa & while it meant a little walk to the pool in the morning it also made it easy for popping directly across the road when visiting Bali Collection for shopping, meals or the supermarket, it was very quiet here too. We also asked for our bar fridge to be emptied to allow us to use it with our supermarket purchases. We sat down with the concierge on our first day & made all our bookings…"
5,"We stayed at the hotel for 5D4N as part of our honeymoon trip.  As we walked in to go check-in, the entrance is wide open with an impeccable view to the ocean. We previously booked a garden view room. Since it was our honeymoon, we asked if there's possibility for a free upgrade to an Ocean view room.  They advised us the all the ocean view rooms were fully booked, which we suspected not the case.  This being said, our room has a very nice garden view room and the last unit.  thus away from all the noise. Room was very large and well maintained.  Location of the hotel is right across from Bali Collection, which has good shopping and good restaurants.  I didn't eat at the hotel as usually they're more expensive.  Go to Bali Collection. Staffs at the hotels are very friendly and…"
5,"Had 8 nights here with the youngens' and it just worked. Days by the pools and beach and exploring the Balinese surrounds. The people are lovely and the food adds to the appeal. July was a good time to go and the sea breeze reduces the tropical heat, especially near the coast!"

5,"We stayed mid June using a Luxury escapes package for the first time and was very pleasantly surprised at the value for the cost of the package. The hotel is in a brilliant tropical garden setting on the beach and is well worth the stay. We found the room quite spacious,with the balcony overlooking a small pond area with some interesting native animals and birds frequent visitors. We ate at the hotel most nights and found the food to be of a good quality generally and in particular the Japanese restaurant (free voucher) excellent.The Persona lounge for a pre- dinner drink was a favourite and service good. Breakfast at the poolside restaurant was a bit of a bun fight most days, dependent on what time you arrived,but we have found this in a lot of hotels in Bali. Pool area could…"
4,"just come back from 5 nights in the Grand Hyatt Bali . Lovely garden surroundings with easy access to beach. We had bed and breakfast , good size room and breakfast had large selection of food ( only disappointment was the chicken not pork sausages  ,but not the end of the world as the bacon made up for it  )plenty of other choices including Asian foods as well .  Added bonus was there a shopping center opposite hotel (called Bali collection)that has many restaurants in it , and supermarket so topping up the mini bar quite easy!"
1,"I was coming with my husband and 2 kids, We Have stayed there for 2 nights, the first day we came is around 3pm, they gave me a smaller room and we asked to change the room, but they need to prepared another room so they asked me to wait another hour, so we decide to walk around while waiting. Untill 6pm we back to the new room but our luggage still not yet moved. We keep asked them to move and yet it wasn't come till 7.30pm. We cant change clothes or refresh without our luggage. Its very disappointed. The service not helping. And the day we check out we request to check out a little late because our flight was in the evening and we suggested to wait in the gym club for waiting instead, its ok for me and my husband but how bout the 2 and 4 years old children. We explained how…"
5,"It's like a small Bali village in itself. You don't have to step out at all as this hotel brings different Bali elements under one roof. They have a small street market with Balinese art and have traditional Bali dance every night at Indonesian restaurant. This property is 25 years old so obviously the architecture, layout of the room is also old. Nothing is wrong about it but do not go there and be disappointed because there are stairs in middle of the room. We were in the East village with the Lounge Club right in front of our room. The view from the room was spectacular, the bed was huge (we live in Hong kong and our sense of space is a little messed up). The lounge serves yum snacks and cocktails.  The best part of the property is that you always feel you are closed to the…"
3,"We had eight nights at the Grand Hyatt in July and while overall it was an enjoyable stay there were some things that bothered me. We booked our trip through Luxury Escapes and so had a whole host of complimentary things like massages and nightly cocktails to enjoy. These were great extras (I mean, yeah, of course they were factored into the price somewhere) but if I didn’t have them I’d probably have resented the liquor prices at the bar and would have fled in horror at the prices for the spa services. It was our first time using Luxury Escapes and it worked very smoothly on the whole.  The positives: -	The grounds are lovely. Just immaculate and a pleasure to walk around. -	The Indonesian food available at the Garden Café and through room service was excellent -	Our room was…"

3,"Spent 2 weeks on this resort with amazing grounds but poor accomodation and service.  The rooms are In desperate need of an upgrade/ refurbish and staff in general need to be more attentive to the needs of holiday goers. The service is definitely not always with a smile and will not be given with a ""wanting to please"" attitude. Leaves much to be desired here..... The grounds on the resort are spectacular , plenty to do for kids and adults alike. Lots of restaurants to choose from and between June- July a beach Bbq is also offered which has great food and atmosphere as well.  There is a spa centre which offers amazing treatments in a purpose  built villa style retreat sanctiary. A must if you enjoy a little indulgence.  A good size shopping mall 'Bali Collection' is within…"
5,We never left this resort during our trip. Excellent staff that greets you with a sincere smile. The pool is great and the water slide is okay. There are three places for breakfast. Very close to Bali Collection. The beach is SUPERB. Love the resort and I will consider visiting it again.
5,"This was our first resort holiday and we loved it. Staff were amazing, facilities plentiful. Even if eating and drinking was fairly pricey within the resort, but that's resorts for you. Kids club could do with improvements as far as activities for 8-12 yr olds but our 3 yr old loved it.  Kids could run around, I mean swim around all day quite safely. Lots of other kids to meet and play with, which gives mum and dad rest time.  Definitely will be back again.  Thanks for a great holiday. "
4,"The hotel looks old, the rooms need renovation. This hotel is different from Hyatt standards in other cities. I loved breakfast and squirrels. Big territory, good spa. The gym is small. Close to restaurants and bars."
3,"Very large resort with nice location of you are after some piece and quiet. However it is in need of some major repairs and upgrades if it's to stay on par with other resorts in Bali. Room we stayed in had some major issues from air conditioning not working properly, cracked tiles and broken fittings. Service was great. Restaurants could perhaps serve hot more variety of food. All the menus look the same. Excellent spa within the resort. "

5,"we were so looking forward to going back to this paradise of a hotel and when we got there , we sighed with relief . Everything was just how we left it 1 year ago.Opon arrival we were shown to our room, which was an upgrade from last year and one which we did not ask for , so that was a very good start. The room{1523} was near the grand club rooms and was bigger all round and because it was on the fifth floor, we  woke to a fantastic sea view every day.In this room, there was no damp smell, like we had last year. Also we had a defuser which just made the room smell fresh. In summery, the hotel is fantastic , with 2 small negatives for us.1, we think the hotel food and drinks are way to expensive and thus that is why we and many others go to the Bali collection to eat and drink.…"
3,"This resort is out of date and very old style, I had a feeling I were staying in condo hotel. I understand this was built many 20 years ago.   my room was large and comfortable. but it 's a super long distance between my room and restaurants or pool. sometimes, I forgot sth , it took 15mins to walk back and forward.   The breakfast at Garden cafe was poor. very small area while hotel has a big numbers of rooms. we had to get line for table. the staffs not attentive.  they had own beach but not nice or well display.   The staffs at restaurant are friendly. I felt sorry for the staff because they worked very hard under the hot weather of Bali.   I think should have a renovation to beautify this resort."
4,"Stayed at Conrad Nusa Dua 2 yrs ago and rode bikes along foreshore past Grand Hyatt and wanted to stay here next time, so we did. Hotel definitely occupies largest and cleanest stretch of beach in area. Loved the trees that provide shade by the beach. Hotel itself is grand and impressive. Rooms were fine and service ok. Perfect spot for kids, water slides and pools were excellent for kids aged 2-12 yrs old. Very busy week at the hotel, with Australian school holidays coinciding with Indonesian holidays, so of course the hotel was overflowing with guests and kids. Not suitable for honeymooners or couples without kids, but if you do have kids..... It's perfect! Our two, aged 7 and 9 thought it was paradise. They could roam the grounds freely and even loved shopping from the beach…"

5,"After a delayed flight arrived at the airport and found the Grand Hyatt sign. We were led to a room to sit and wait. not a word said to us about why we were going there.  not offered water or anything and had to sit and listen to heavy metal screaming music.  Eventually someone came to get us. Grand Hyatt arrival.   The welcome at the Grand Hyatt was great.  Greeted with a cold drink and a towel.  We were then taken to our room, the portacot all set up for bub, made so beautifully.  We then walk into the bathroom and find a gift for baby consisting of a flannel, toy and johnson's baby goods.   The room is spacious and very clean.  Lovely view of a pond out the front on our terrace.  The resort is huge.  Bali Collections is just a w minute walk out the front door.  Gym is well…"

3,"Overall it was a good holiday. Just not what I expected and it didn't live up to what we always take away from staying at a Hyatt hotel. The wow factor.   However staying at the other Hyatt properties such as Sydney, Canberra , Melbourne ,Singapore we have always been wowed and impressed.   The property is spectacular on arrival. Lobby is just gorgeous and staff, very attentive.   Unfortunately It went down from there.   The staff do go out of their way to help. Which is wonderful.  But they seem to be understaffed, at the lobby bar Persona , we always waited for service , tables not cleared .   Breakfast was always extremely chaotic and didn't seem to be well organised. Food , hit and miss . Granted It's peak season but it seems unorganised and chaos reigns.   Rooms have a damp…"
2,"Stayed 8 nights at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua.   Key takeaways were: - Staff are poorly trained and service is terrible at best.  Examples are ice to the room takes an hour, coffee in the morning never comes, rooms not fully cleaned, transport requires multiple confirmations, cocktails are average if not terrible.   - The older part (south and east) of the hotels have loud noise coming through the roof and from the hallways.  Doors slamming, furniture and doors moving in the upstairs room. - The food and drink prices are three times that of neighbouring hotels (The Inya hotel next door for better prices and service).  Most people were using vouchers so maybe there are some deals on food/drink about. - The pool area is very busy with the 'reserve my lounge' brigade out with…"
5,"Stayed last 2 weeks of June, this is my second stay at the Grand Hyatt, and it was great to be back. The staff are amazing and nothing is to much trouble for them even when under pressure.Last year we stayed in May and it was a lot more quite,this year was very busy with lots of children taking over the pools so it was difficult to enjoy a swim. Breakfast was very busy and had to wait for a table nearly every day, but the staff managed to seat every one with a smile and apology. The room we had was lovely and clean.Hopefully we will be back next year but we will try and come at a different month. Thanks again to every one at the Grand Hyatt you are all stars."
4,"We (myself, wife and 7 y.o. daughter) recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua as part of a Luxury Escapes package.   This place was great, we had excellent accommodation, the meals provided were good and the facilities were accessible and enjoyable.   The staff are exceptional and go out of their way to help you, we needed an adaptor for the power point and dialled the concierge, within 10 minutes there was a porter at the door with 2 of them for us  to use.   We had room service which was delivered on time, and the wheel-in cart/table they use was great for dining. The gymnasium is pretty good with enough equipment to maintain your fitness regime, and there's a paved footpath along the foreshore if you feel like a jog in the fresh air. There are heaps of different pools…"
5,"this is a great Hyatt property and pretty much everything here is great shape. Makes every family vacation memorable. A lazy river themed pool with slides, private beach, lotus ponds, the list of goodness is endless.  We took the breakfast package with our room and the breakfast spread was pretty decent - but the lines and wait time after 8:30am gets pretty irritating. And if it rains, then most outdoor seating become useless causing long wait times. The staff is very courteous and do everything to make your stay comfortable."

5,We stayed Grand Hyatt with extended family on this trip.  I emailed and asked  if  we could have four rooms on a certain floor and it was no problem which I thought it might be as school holidays were about to commence.  Once again the Hyatt lived up to all our expectations and more. We discovered the roof top bar on this trip and it was a little slice of heaven up there. The restaurants and Service once again was  amazing. The only probably we found this time was the breakfast rush both places were very full and had lines of people waiting  for a seat the staff did their best.  As for the Kyra spa AMAZING But we love the Hyatt and will be back again next year.
5,"Stay: 3 nights in June 2016  We (my husband and I) had a fantastic stay at GH Bali. The hotel is beautiful (and very large!), right on Nusa Dua Beach. There are 5 pools within the hotel so there are lots of places to lay out and play in the pool.  We got a Grand Club room so we had our own check-in area as well as access to the Grand Club Lounge. I would definitely recommend spending the extra money to have access to the Grand Club Lounge--it provides a great breakfast (your choice of pancakes, eggs, lots of bread and jams, pastries, etc), refreshments throughout the day.

5,"My wife and baby spent one week at the Grand Hyatt in Bali in June and had a wonderful time. The resort is extremely beautiful, much nicer than the pictures. Plenty of pools, nice beach, and things to do. The best part was a shopping center across the street known as Bali Collection. They have a grocery store, tons of restaurants, places to get massages, etc for significantly cheaper than the hotel. If you can swing the upgrade to the suite definitely do it. It is very spacious and well worth the upgrade."
2,"The Hyatt is a spectacular property and always has been. With a very large beach front, several pools, well-landscaped gardens, you would not be faulted for thinking you were in Eden.   However management has managed to try to destroy a good thing by lack of maintenance and subpar service. It's probably not their fault that a certain origination of tourist supplies most of the hotel's revenue however that's probably also not justification for subpar quality.   Would not recommend the hotel and will avoid in the future unless management changes and new management refocuses on cleanliness and service  Positives + immaculate grounds including several distinct pools, water slides, gardens, beach front, kids club, restaurants   Negatives - terrible food regardless of restaurant  -…"
5,"Lovely hotel. Grand Room was lovely. All staff so very friendly. Went on a Luxury Escapes deal with an upgrade.  Well worth the money. All the food was delicious. We had our last meal in Salsa Verde and I have never tasted chicken like it before it was so delicious. All the pools were lovely. If you want to sit around the pool in some peace and quiet and you don't like the beach this hotel maybe not for you.  There were soooooo many kids. The quietest pool was the Emerald Pool which I believe not all quest can use but people where escaping from the big pools to this pool to try and get some quiet time.  We are beach people so it didn't bother us at all.  We stayed on the beautiful beach all day and just went back for a swim when we were to hot.  The beach, in my opinion, is the…"
5,We stayed Grand Hyatt with extended family on this trip.  I emailed and asked  if  we could have four rooms on a certain floor and it was no problem which I thought it might be as school holidays were about to commence.  Once again the Hyatt lived up to all our expectations and more. We discovered the roof top bar on this trip and it was a little slice of heaven up there. The restaurants and Service once again was  amazing. The only probably we found this time was the breakfast rush both places were very full and had lines of people waiting  for a seat the staff did their best.  As for the Kyra spa AMAZING But we love the Hyatt and will be back again next year.
5,"Stay: 3 nights in June 2016  We (my husband and I) had a fantastic stay at GH Bali. The hotel is beautiful (and very large!), right on Nusa Dua Beach. There are 5 pools within the hotel so there are lots of places to lay out and play in the pool.  We got a Grand Club room so we had our own check-in area as well as access to the Grand Club Lounge. I would definitely recommend spending the extra money to have access to the Grand Club Lounge--it provides a great breakfast (your choice of pancakes, eggs, lots of bread and jams, pastries, etc), refreshments throughout the day. For dinner: it provides hors d'ouvres but the quantity is so large and it's buffet style so you totally get full--we never needed to eat afterwards.

5,"beautiful hotel, ideal if you want to escape the hustle of Kuta and Seminyak. Grounds, pool and beach were immaculate. Rooms ageing but still nice. Came with family of 5 (and left with 5). Great staff, special mention to Ninik - best duty manager/concierge of all time."
5,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt on a Luxury Escapes deal for six nights in June. What a glorious place to stay! You immediately sense the luxurious ambiance upon arrival and each new guest is welcomed with a refreshing towel and cold glass of orange juice.  Check-in was simple enough. We had to wait a couple of hours for our room to be ready but we just went for a walk around the perfectly manicured grounds and enjoyed an ice cold Bintang in the lobby bar.  Our first night was a little unpleasant. There was a strong, musty/mouldy odour in the room. It was probably coming from the air conditioner but it was very strong and interferred with sleep. This was no problem for the staff though. Even though the hotel was heavily booked, the friendly staff moved us to another room with no…"
5,"We stayed in a generous, comfortable and clean club room. The property itself is huge with sprawling mature gardens, ponds, wildlife, a range of swimming pools, restaurants and a private beach. Without exception staff were friendly and professional. The club is a delight and well worth the extra money. Our stay was immensely relaxing and pleasurable. Recommended."
4,"Great place to stay if you have children ,staff are wonderful and gardens lovely . Found the restaurants a bit pricey but for a short taxi ride you can find some lovely places to eat .nusa Dua  pizza the best I've ever had ."
5,"When we first arrived at the hotel, we were impressed at its vastness and location. The lobby of the hotel isn't like the usual hotels that we have stayed at, it had koi ponds all around, open air and was humongous. This is a great place to stay to escape the hustle and bustle of a city.   The property is so huge, that its seperated into different 'villages'. At each village there will be plenty of ammenities and beautiful gardens. There's plenty of animal wildlife to keep you entertained there. It felt like we were in some zen garden the whole time. After which we explored the beach and were so glad we chose this place compared to its neighbouring resorts. I presume this is one of the fewere properties in Nusa Dua that has a massive beach to itself next to the hotel grounds. …"

5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali has become one of my favorite hotels in the world.  Things run a little slower on Bali and I love coming here to relax, have some pampering and enjoying total relaxation.  After spending three nights in the hills of Sidemen, I was looking forward to being back in an area with things to do and in walking distance from the hotel.  The Grand Hyatt is large with four wings of rooms.  I was in the Grand Club and took advantage of their services.  My room was large with a sunken sitting area.  The bathroom is also large with plenty of closet and storage space.  Sleeping was no problem, I found the bed extremely comfortable.  What makes the Grand Hyatt so great is the service.  The entire staff are friendly, gracious and service oriented.   As a return guest, they…"
4,I stayed here for one night only to catch up with friends who were visiting Bali. At first I was not impressed. It took a long time to get my room ready and when it was some other guests were given the same room. after I returned later that night there was a note apologizing for the inconvenience and a gift of a batik sarong. So all was forgiven.  In fact the staff are terrific. Always helpful and good natured. I used two of what looked like four or more pools. There are heaps of facilities here but with only one day I did not get to muse them all. My friends said the restaurants were good and they had a number of massages.  I often go to Bali for work and whilst this hotel is fantastic for a relaxing holiday you are in a tourist compound with little contact with local Balinese.…
4,"We visited this property in April. It's a huge property, away from the hustle bustle of the main town. So if you are looking for some solace, this is the place for you, rooms are huge- we got a sea facing room on a higher floor and it was beautiful. But if you are looking to enjoy Bali by visiting the main town or partying, then this might be little too far from everything."
5,"We are still enjoying our 8 day luxury travel package at the Grand Hyatt Bali. We leave tomorrow night and wish we had booked longer at this very amazing place. Talk about feeling right at home here! Staff are well trained and will fall over backwards for your every whim! Only complaint is..... The ice melts, way 2 quick in the amazing drinks!  Keep bringing them ice buckets!"
3,"We stay only one night after experienced Cons more than Pros  Pros: Nice hotel even a little bit old but still okay as the room is spacious. Facilities for family with kids or teens were really accommodated. Hotel has kind of private beach with each chair that really nice to have.  Cons: Mediocre service during check-in as we need to wait our room ready in 1.5 hours even we arrived already passed 3 pm. When we checked out, we also need to wait 30 mins to get the room boy picked up our luggage. The breakfast also just like in the morning market, it didn't show like 5 stars hotel but one staff a middle age local man was very helpful.  So, instead to stay 3 days we decided to check-out at the 2nd day and move to other hotel near Legian which was below their rank but could give…"

1,"I'm not one for writing a bad review unless it is genuinely justified.   We are so disappointed that this hotel is not the ""water palace"" as described in the brochure and the ""peaceful haven"" that their Instagram feed would suggest.  This is a lovely FAMILY hotel but most definitely not the type of place to go if you want to relax on honeymoon.  It is literally crammed full of kids which of course is not a problem if that's what you advertise yourself as. You cannot be a ""peaceful haven"" and a family hotel at the same time.  The hotel is also pretty understaffed, be prepared to wait when ordering anything and breakfast is a bit like something out the Hunger Games.  We also waited 2 hours to access our room because it wasn't ready. They had mentioned something about a flower bath…"
5,"I have been very fortunate to visit many countries and a wide range of hotels but this has to be my favourite. We have now stayed here six times in seventeen years. After many hours of travelling you are always 'grumpy' on arrival. As you get out of your transport the gong is sounded, you look over the immaculate gardens to the swimming pools and the blue sea and you know the travel was worth while. the staff, the facilities and the grounds are simply excellent. The rooms were spotlessly clean although one or two are showing signs of their age. There was a wide range of food available for breakfast in a couple of different venues. The staff are always friendly and helpful. it is our idea of heaven and we will return in two years time."
4,"The Resort is situated on a large clean, well manicured property with a few pools. The beach is nice and clean with plenty of lounges and shade for those who need it. There are three restaurants, a spa with very good therapists. A band plays every night in the lobby which is a nice place to relax in the evenings.  The staff are wonderful, very polite and provide excellent service.  Negatives - The room seemed a bit run down and gave an unpleasant odor.  The breakfast was ok but there weren't delicacies nor variety in hot meals which you notice when you are on a long stay.   Dinner in the Italian restaurant was average and the presentation was far below the standard for a 5 star resort. To give you an idea, my pasta was served on a breakfast plate and the dessert (tiramisu) came…"
5,"From the moment you arrive, there is a sense of luxury and calm. The staff are welcoming and friendly and are always willing to help out or pass by with a friendly hello.  We stayed in a ground floor Ocean View King Room (Room 2120) with our Luxury Escapes package that we pre-purchased. The room was great - a balcony within a few metres of the pool and a short walk to the beach. Did I mention the wet room access from the balcony? Super convenient for when you get out of the pool and back into your room without leaving a trail of water behind you.  Initially I was skeptical about the Luxury Escapes package given it was our first time pre-purchasing one of their deals but it turned out perfectly and delivered on everything that was outlined in the deal. No corners cut whatsoever. …"
5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali was the perfect place to stay to recharge after a hectic year. Everything was perfect, clean and easy. With 2 children aged 8 and 5, we spent a significant amount of time at pool. Make sure you bring goggles for the kids as the chlorine in the pool with the blue slide can be over powering. TIP: If you want a more relaxing, cooler and less chlorine try the traditional Bali pool.  We used the kids club a couple of times  over our 10 day stay and the girls had a great time.  Thanks to all the staff for making it so easy and pleasant stay.   My daughter had her 8th birthday and her friend emailed the hotel the night before to request a cake be served to her at breakfast! The staff made it happen and sang to her with only a few hours notice. You can't ask for any…"

5,Spacious suite facing the club pool n the ocean. Comfortable clean bed linens n good room service. Children were very welcome n they have reasonably priced food within the resort. Beautiful pools. The kids have 3 to choose from! N it's super close to the beach. Very clean n very beautiful! 
5,"That's an amazing hotel to stay in. Very luxury and lots of greenery. We had to change the room few times to get better view. Service is great.  Several pools, beach-very shallow water. We couldn't swim much that period in the sea. Great restaurants and fitness club."

4,After a week villa stay in Kuta with family friends it was time to stay at Grand Hyatt Bali. A very picturesque hotel on the beach with multiple pools and restaurants . While we booked here to have a resort holiday we ate breakfast and dinner at Bali collection as it was close and offered variety . We always ate lunch at the poolside with a nice simple menu and good service .  The only downside was the service we received at check in and have since dealt with the same lady who was rude and no customer focus . This really isn't an experience I'm used too at any Hyatt property .  Overall a very comfortable stay and I would recommend .

4,"After a rather hectic first trip to Bali, my wife and I decided to take things much slower this time around.  Now that we found where the best places to visit are, we filled our time with spas, massages, afternoon tea and quality time on the beach and around the pool.  Grand Hyatt provides quality customer service and the breakfast buffet has just about everything for every taste.  The pools were great, not overcrowded.  Families with kids generally congregate to one area so its not too noisy everywhere.    The waves in the ocean were quite stronger than I anticipated and beware of the jellyfish this time of year!    Overall, the stay was great, especially the peaceful evenings laying out on the beach after sunset.  Make sure to walk around the entire Nusa Dua peninsula and…"
5,"What an experience, I cannot fault anything from our 8 night stay. Just walking into the foyer we knew it was going to be a great place. They rooms are well appointed and very spacious. Pools and resort facilities were exceptional. Food was outstanding at all the restaurant we ate at with a special mention to Anita in the Salsa Verde restaurant. Cocktails were Good especially at the Salsa Bar overlooking the ocean, what a view. Stay were friendly and a special mention to Dewi from house keeping. The Spa and beauty shop were outstanding also. Highly recommend for a wonderful holiday in a beautiful resort."
5,"We were back at Grand Hyatt Bali end of March 2016, and the moment we arrived at the resort, we were HOME! Greeted by the hotel staff with their usual, fantastic hospitality. Our check in was a breeze and we absolutely enjoyed our stay. If I had to complain about one thing, it would be that our trip was a little too short! Will definitely be back there again REALLY soon!"

5,5 star resort for cheap price if purchased in a package deal. The hotel had excellent service and the food was great. The location is in a prime spot being next to Bali Collections and The Bay Bali both ideal for cheap food and drinks. The hotel has everything from shops to money exchange. Would visit again easily and recommend. 
5,"I can describe the stay in this hotel as luxury in nature. Awesome resort having natural ponds and pools. Own street market area (loved by all females). Highly recommended to people who loves nature. Lovely landscapes right from the entrance. Natural ponds welcomes in lobby & beautiful view of blue skies with ocean. The hotel itself having it's long private beach with all amenities. Have a nice evening walk, for sure memorable for everyone.   Other amenities are at it's best to the star rated hotel. Nice restaurant, Courteous staff. Good food. They balanced well it for both professional as well as family stay. Try staying once, Nice stay!"
5,"We arrived at Grand Hyatt after spending a week in the hustle and bustle of Seminyak. This was the exact opposite ... Relaxing, tranquil, quiet and luxurious. We purchased a Luxury Escapes (LE) deal (with vip upgrade) - this was absolute value for money. The room was clean, modern (being able to watch AFL on the TV was an added bonus) air conditioning was cool and the bathroom well appointed and large. The grounds have a sense of grandeur with many pools to choose from.  The massages, manicures, pedicures and reflexology which were all part of the LE deal were splendid. We enjoyed our nightly complimentary cocktails and the food although not outstanding was adequate. If you are looking for a relaxing and peaceful break then the Grand Hyatt Bali is the place for you."
4,"An excellent package deal with Luxury Escapes . Standard room was spacious but lacked adequate drawer space . Good sized bathroom. The room was close to the beach but a long way from lobby and spa but only part of which was undercover. However umbrellers were allways available.Excellent room service with plenty of towels. There were many swimming pools but would have appreciated an adults only pool. Plenty of recliners both for beach and pool areas. The food was good and the best was the Nampu Japanese restaurant. A beautiful beach which was well maintained, likewise the large park like grounds we loved the wildlife.   Luxury Escapes"
5,"Beautiful. Spacious. Amazing staff. Lovely beachside & lots of pools. Great food at the restaurants; night market & shops on site; superb spa facilities; walking distance to Bali Central (other shops, restaurants).  Slight flaws  * The room, while lovely and clean and beautifully serviced, needs to have the walls cleaned to remove the spots arising from the equatorial humidity. * The floors are marble so when anything is moved in a room above you, it echoes in your room. * We deliberately went outside of northern & southern school holidays and during tourist shoulder season. And while we love kids and it is a family friendly resort, it would have been that bit better if one of the four accommodation buildings in a kess than full hotel could have made available for us old farts…"
5,5 star resort for cheap price if purchased in a package deal. The hotel had excellent service and the food was great. The location is in a prime spot being next to Bali Collections and The Bay Bali both ideal for cheap food and drinks. The hotel has everything from shops to money exchange. Would visit again easily and recommend. 
5,"I can describe the stay in this hotel as luxury in nature. Awesome resort having natural ponds and pools. Own street market area (loved by all females). Highly recommended to people who loves nature. Lovely landscapes right from the entrance. Natural ponds welcomes in lobby & beautiful view of blue skies with ocean. The hotel itself having it's long private beach with all amenities. Have a nice evening walk, for sure memorable for everyone.   Other amenities are at it's best to the star rated hotel.

5,Had gone in April during my official offsite to Bali.  Might run short of words.. just would describe amazing place.. property is huge.. I got lost several times...but no worries its fun. Amazing people/ staff.. Rooms beautiful.. Have real unforgettable memories. Good decent banquets for meeting..  Everything is really good
5,"What a Great resort. Loved our 6 night stay with our two daughters 6 and 10. The grounds are amazing and so well looked after. The rooms are great, the day bed was massive the girls loved sleeping in it. An adult can easy sleep on it too.  A fresh coat of paint is all the rooms really need. The pools are amazing, the slide fantastic. The minute you enter to lobby of the resort you are just blown away it's beautiful.  The breakfast is great, lots of variety.  The only problem we encountered was the cultural dinner and show.  Very expensive and was not a lit of variety for the money. You can watch the show without dinner for about $17aud.  Location is great. 2 min walk to Bali collection shops or ten minutes if you go along the beach front.  Overall I would stay there again…"
5,"My family and I had never been to Bali when we settled on the grand Hyatt! And it was amazing! The resort was large, The rooms could have a little work, but still were comfortable and appropriate. Great fun for children, Surfing, Water slides, bikes on rent, pool after pool, beach activities, as well as brochures for activities outside the resort are provided. We loved nearly never having to have money on us in the resort, because you could basically charge everything on the rooms. Lots of meal options, and the staff were so kind, humble and wonderful. Food was well priced."
5,"From the welcoming, friendly staff, to the luxurious rooms and gorgeous tropical gardens and pools, the Grand Hyatt Bali was a dream come true.  The food in each of the restaurants was exceptional, with a stunning beach at the doorstep.  The Day Spa was fabulous and the resort caters for your every wish."
5,"The room was so-so, but the lush landscaping more than made up for it.   The pools, waterfalls, and spa are top notch.  Great place to just chill out for a week.   Nearby shopping is an easy 10-minute walk."

5,"Good ambience, spacious and very well managed room, friendly staff and always great breakfast :)  Only downside (and at the same time plus side) is that this place is very secluded so bad access to fun area of Kuta or Seminyak (and at the same time quiet with superior privacy). Best choice for people who likes quiet ambience of Nusa Dua."
4,"Beautiful resort with an amazing entrance. The rooms need upgrading but ok. The rooms are a very good size as are the bathrooms. Very clean. There are a number of nice shops in the resort. The grounds were absolutely amazing and so well kept. The pool was very nice but we never saw anyone cleaning it unless they do it before we woke up. The restaurants were great, with the Balinese one not that amazing.  The location is great right outside the Bali Collection, you need to go there for cheaper meals and drinks . Shopping is good aswell . Beach was very nice right out the back of the resort. The staff were all very friendly and always helpful. 10 out of 10 for the staff. Beautiful pathway to other resorts in the area. I would return yo this resort again."
5,"Spent three nights here as our company held its annual sales convention in this property. Hosting close to 550 pax was made a breeze by the hotel's competent staff who always ensure rooms were well kept, cleaned on time, etc. Standard rooms on their own are so comfortable in terms of beds, space & simple exudes great luxury. Talk about the view - priceless from every angle. I was fortunate to be here on full moon's day - imagine the beauty of the bright moon light against the soft sandy beach! Worth a visit if you do not mind spending in luxury. The resort is tastefully decorated. I hope my photos depict it well for your viewing pleasure - i went crazy taking various angles of the full moon against the private beach & other hotel decor items. There are three restaurants to…"
5,"My wife and I (and two friends) just returned from 10 nights at the the Grand Hyatt Bali. I expected a very nice place and in fact it exceeded all our expectations. From the moment you enter the vast open air lobby, the place is beautiful. its landscaped as a Balinese village with koi ponds, bridges, pathways, statues, plants and flowers everywhere. There are five pools including a very small, almost private one just off the beach that we used daily (find it). The various restaurants range from good to superb. The sashimi at the fine dining Japanese restaurant was the best I've ever had. They fly the fish in from Japan and the chef also was brought in from Japan. The service everywhere is outstanding and the Balinese people are the most beautiful and friendly we've met anywhere.…"
5,"We were welcomed with warmth and the 9 days we stayed here, we were treated with such hospitality. Staff were not only amazing but were trained to be fine service providers, allowing us to taste our wines and making sure every moment was treated as special."

5,"Grand Hyatt is simply beautiful. The water features around the hotel is nice. The hotel preserved animals like ducks, geese, frogs, lizards and birds. If you are scared of these animals, this hotel might not be a good choice for you. If you choose a room with club facilities, you will have access to Grand Club where you can have a breakfast with a beautiful view of ponds & lots of Koi fishes. The pool is huge & nice. They have the iced cool pool, which I thought was interesting."
5,"Really enjoyed our stay - it wasn't long enough!  The pool slippery slide was a winner with the kids and they loved the kids club. They also loved the ducks, goannas, fish and squirrels.  The spa is great - had a fantastic facial.  Nusa Dua is safe and easy to get to from the airport"
4,"Lovely resort hotel with excellent service. We were part of a wedding group so got an good rate and upgrade to club facilities. We had a Grand Suite, which worked well with 2 kids. Lots of space and nice room. We tried breakfast in 3 places: Watercourt (nice but too hot as it's open air with no air con), Garden Cafe (air con, but gets busy - we couldn't get a table the time we tried), and the Grand Lounge (club). The lounge is also open air but much cooler due to the layout. Still gets hot though! This was the best place for us. Smaller selection (they say it's a continental breakfast, but it's more substantial than that and includes hot food), but calmer and the service is attentive. The lounge also does canapes in the evening - this is another misnomer - it is a mini buffet…"
4,"Great resort for families. Pools and facilities are great for kids of all ages. Friendly staff as expected everywhere Bali. The resort is huge, so expect to do a lot of walking between the front, rooms, pools and dining areas."
5,"The hotel is really great, nice environment, and so peaceful. I was there with my friend last week. I've heard that Grand Hyatt is the biggest hotel in Bali and have many pools to enjoy. During my stay, I and my friend would like to enjoy all of the pools in the hotel, I met a staff, Mr. Putra - Pool Staff, I asked him how many pools does hotel have? I and my friend went to every pools he said except the Balinese Pool, so we asked him the direction of the pool but he said he will go with us cause it is too far from here and it is a bit dark now (it was almost 6 pm or 6.30 pm). When we arrived at the Balinese Pool, he was waiting us until we got out of the pool, he said it is too dark and he afriaded us might get lost cause the hotel is really big. I am really appreciated how…"

5,"Travelled with wife, 3yo & 6yo boys. Travelled in May 2016. Stayed for 10 nights on a Scoopon voucher - same as Luxury Escape voucher offered around same time. Several additional lunches and dinners with a  complimentary massage and entrance to a local themed restaurant Pirate Bay. It appeared that every Australian we met was on the same voucher! :)   Located in Nusa Dua, a tollway being recently added it is at most 30 minutes from Kuta and 60 minutes from Sanur/Gianyar. A major improvement since our last visit.  My wife and I had honeymooned 7 years ago here and had been impressed so when the voucher came up we grabbed it. This is a fantastic resort for young families. Yes it is large so in the heat, guests (young and old) can get fatigued getting from A to B. However it's size…"
5,"The most complete hotel I have stayed at in Bali. Has everything a 5 star hotel should have. Food is to die for. The staff are fabulous. The room was large with nice decor, large separate bathroom and toilet. Very quiet and clean. Would stay a this hotel next trip to Bali, without any doubt the best in Bali."
4,"We recently stayed 8 nights at this property. As we have been to Bali many many times before we were looking for a quiet place to relax with our young children. Staying in Nusa Dua is a bit like being on a Cruise ship as it is located at least half an hour from Kuta and and a long way from many of the Islands natural activities like rafting. For Families that just want to relax this type of resort is fantastic. The Hotel and its grounds are amazing however the food and beverage pricing  is very expensive compared to Kuta. We went on a Luxury Escape package so had some meals and drinks included. Staff and management were fantastic, We had a serious leak in our room due to a large rain storm, they  treated us very well and fixed the problem. Hire a bike from the Hotel and ride…"
5,"An Excellent choice and worthy of 6 stars,  Right on the beach with great staff and reasonable prices for meals and drinks.. Great for families with many children enjoying the facilities Shops and other eateries nearby"
5,"Extremely luxery resort with all the facilities you need. Great swimming pools, beautiful gardens and a very clean beach. Not recommended if you want to see the real culture of Bali. Breakfast is very expensive (!) if it's not included in your booking. Try some cocktails during happy hour at the swimming pool bar, they are the best!"

5,"We stayed here as part of a wedding group.  Whilst the room is looking slightly tired, perhaps 20 years old, the beds were extremely comfortable, and the day bed was just perfect for my 6 year old Daughter.  Nice spacious bathroom but use plenty of towels because the marble tiles are quite slippery.  The lagoon pool and water slide were a highlight for my Daughter, in fact she could have stayed there all day long because she enjoyed it so much, and I witnessed many disappointed kids when their parents had to drag them away.  The staff manning the slide to ensure everyone keeps a safe distance were also very good. On our last morning, my Wife completely forgot her iPhone at the breakfast table in Salsa Verde, yet when she returned 20 mins later, the staff very thankfully had kept…"
4,"Love the location and food in this hotel, especially Salsa Verde. Staffs are great and maintenance is great. No complain on services and facilities within the hotel. However, room needs some renovation and more choices on breakfast will be even better."
4,"Beautiful resort with wonderful gardens decorated with lotus and koi ponds.  Kids love the many options of pools and the best part is the white sandy private beach right behind the resort. Clean, private and beautiful.  Room were okay but renovation would make it even better. Aircon were noisy and room smell a bit musky. But who want to stay in the room when the pools and beach were so inviting and enjoyable  Breakfast (included in the package) were okay but not great compared to other 5 star hotel in the Nusa Dua complex."
4,"We stayed here on a Luxury Escapes deal and it was great. The staff were super friendly and helpful and very accommodating to our 2 little ones.   The pools are really beautiful, we especially loved the pools near the caves and rocks and the kids loved the water slide. The small waterslide doesn't really work which is a shame and the large pool is pretty warm but the rest was really good.   Breakfast was fantastic and the Japanese meal was super fresh and delicious. The Italian restaurant was ok, the Balinese buffet was really good and the sunset bar was my favourite.   Some rooms are really far away from the beach and are a bit old so make sure you're close to the beach and in an updated room. Our room was lagoon view and beach view and was quite big with a large alcove bed for…"
4,"Our family of four (2 adults and 2 kids) stayed here recently with two other families on a Luxury Escapes package.  The room was large enough for our family and had a balcony overlooking gardens and a pond.  The day bed was big enough for our two kids (aged 8 and 10) to sleep on together.  They actually found it better to sleep across it rather than long ways.  The king bed was huge albeit a little firmer than we'd like but that's a matter of personal taste.  The resort itself is huge and the gardens are immaculate.  The view from the open air lobby is stunning.  There are two main pools, one along the beach side of the resort with a small waterslide and a second pool with a larger waterslide and a canyon area. We found the pool temperature to be on the warm side but the weather…"

3,"We stayed in early May and were wowed by the lobby, the grounds and the friendly staff at every turn. The room was clean and had a great outlook over a lily pond. There was a fruit bowl with some tropical fruit in it, but no cutlery or plates to use, consequently the fruit stayed there and was not replaced at all during our 8 night stay. We had to alert housekeeping that amenities in the bathroom were not replaced, and the cabinet door to the minibar kept falling off its hinges. The cleaning staff also called through to housekeeping about the door but no one had fixed it on our departure! Very disappointing! Not a great look!"
5,Close tot the Airport aftera long trip. Several restaurants. Rooms are spacious. Personel is very kind. Enormous loung wereld children canvas ring the gong. Close to a shopping center with various restaurants.
5,"For a wife who did not want to go to Bali she is now wanting to return ASAP. Grand Hyatt Bali was way beyond expectations. The staff were extraordinary, always friendly, smiling & helpful. Nothing was ever too much trouble. We were most impressed with the staff greeting us by name & remembering all of our details. Our room on the 3rd level, overlooking the beach was magnificent, always serviced efficiently & bed turned down every night with the added touch of a Frangipani flower on the pillow. There was a super selection of dining areas catering to all types of cuisines. All meals were extraordinary as were the waiters / waitresses. Beach was a picture with the grader being used every morning to maintain the picturesque scene. All amenities are available on site & if one wished…"
5,"The location is perfect for you to relax in the quite area of Bali. Celebrated our anniversary here, would not be able to had an amazing one without the help of the staff, to be specific Justin Angelina, for delivering service beyond expectation. The staff at the lounge was very helpful to in arranging food for allergies to be specific Gluten Free or Gluten Intolerant food. All in all an amazing 5 days. Would definitely come back. Several pools around the hotel, and a dedicated one for Club Room guest"

3,"We stayed in early May and were wowed by the lobby, the grounds and the friendly staff at every turn. The room was clean and had a great outlook over a lily pond. There was a fruit bowl with some tropical fruit in it, but no cutlery or plates to use, consequently the fruit stayed there and was not replaced at all during our 8 night stay. We had to alert housekeeping that amenities in the bathroom were not replaced, and the cabinet door to the minibar kept falling off its hinges. The cleaning staff also called through to housekeeping about the door but no one had fixed it on our departure! Very disappointing! Not a great look!"
5,Close tot the Airport aftera long trip. Several restaurants. Rooms are spacious. Personel is very kind. Enormous loung wereld children canvas ring the gong. Close to a shopping center with various restaurants.
5,"For a wife who did not want to go to Bali she is now wanting to return ASAP. Grand Hyatt Bali was way beyond expectations. The staff were extraordinary, always friendly, smiling & helpful. Nothing was ever too much trouble. We were most impressed with the staff greeting us by name & remembering all of our details. Our room on the 3rd level, overlooking the beach was magnificent, always serviced efficiently & bed turned down every night with the added touch of a Frangipani flower on the pillow. There was a super selection of dining areas catering to all types of cuisines. All meals were extraordinary as were the waiters / waitresses. Beach was a picture with the grader being used every morning to maintain the picturesque scene. All amenities are available on site & if one wished…"
5,"The location is perfect for you to relax in the quite area of Bali. Celebrated our anniversary here, would not be able to had an amazing one without the help of the staff, to be specific Justin Angelina, for delivering service beyond expectation. The staff at the lounge was very helpful to in arranging food for allergies to be specific Gluten Free or Gluten Intolerant food. All in all an amazing 5 days. Would definitely come back. Several pools around the hotel, and a dedicated one for Club Room guest"
3,"Stayed for a week during May 2016 at Grand Hyatt Bali for a family vacation. Enjoyed the family orientated resort with good pools and water slide for the kids. The beach was nice and clean with white sand however being a surf beach can be dangerous for the little ones. The hotel was opened in 1991 and the guest rooms haven't been updated since. They are showing their age however are kept clean and tidy. All other aspects of the resort were great. Food options were great, however the price of food and beverage was higher than average considering the quality. Nice resort and location if you're looking for something outside the hustle and bustle of Kuta and Seminyak."
5,"Beautiful location, unreal gardens with magnificent pools all with total shade areas to relax. Food and service excellent. We could not praise this hotel highly enough! Nusa Dua area is also very clean, tidy and safe."
5,"Paradise in Bali.  Safe, exotic, clean, and very family friendly.  It was just my wife and I on this trip, but there were many families.  Get transport from the hotel from the airport.  Get access to the Grand Club and eat and enjoy your time away from work.  This is a really nice place.  High end shops on the property.  Beautiful pools, yes many pools!  Visit them all.  They are worth it!  The staff are GREAT!!  Everyone greets you and is very friendly.  I highly recommend this hotel if you want to feel safe, eat some exotic food that won't give you stomach problems, and just relax.  No complaints here, but again I recommend getting Grand Club access.  It is so worth it!  If I could have, I would have stayed here at least a week.  Questions, just ask."
5,"It has taken me a few months to write this review, but I've been meaning to do it because we had such a wonderful experience at the Grand Hyatt!  We checked in here after making a reservation online from another nusa dua hotel that did not meet our expectations.  Everything from check-in to check- out (except the loaner stroller that lost a wheel halfway down the street) was just wonderful. The food is AMAZING. The staff is friendly and warm. The water slide and toddler pool is so beautiful and fun for little ones.  There is also a jungle gym on the beach, a trampoline, and rental bicycles etc. They have crayons and paper for children at meals and  MOST IMPORTANTLY and wonderfully, they have a doctor on site!! My daughter had a really high fever and I received the most wonderful…"
5,"We visited the Grand Hyatt on our honeymoon twenty years ago and decided to return to celebrate our twentieth wedding anniversary last week. What a great decision! From the moment we arrived we found the service friendly and attentive. We had booked a king deluxe club room, but were upgraded to a gorgeous suite and the Club Team arranged some lovely flowers and sparkling wine to welcome us. The suite was very spacious, beautifully appointed and superbly comfortable with a a lovely terrace balcony opening on to a lily pond. We loved the Club Lounge with its tranquil aspect overlooking a water garden just brimming with wildlife and the extensive gardens were even more glorious than we remembered from our first visit. The Club serves a very nice complimentary breakfast and is a…"

5,"What a wonderful hotel to stay in !  The grounds and gardens are immaculate and so tranquil.  This resort is huge and our room was also spacious, clean and very comfortable.  Could not fault the staff for their friendliness and desire to help in any way possible .  The pools were amazing and kids loved the choice of pools and of course the water slides . The beach was beautiful and water warm and clean to swim in .  All the restaurants in the hotel were great , very fast, attentive service and food was delicious. Loved the breakfasts at Salsa Verde and at Garden Cafe.  The day spa was pure bliss, like nothing else I'd ever seen .  Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone ,families or couples for an amazing experience. You could easily stay within the resort with such a…"
5,Breathtaking view inside and around. It's a huge resort and perfect for leisure travelers. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. Also the property is very well maintained. Though wish the pool would be open beyond 7pm.   Kriya spa is one of the best spa experience I have got till date. It has a good balance of traditional yet modern spa experience.  
5,"Beautiful and well-kept hotel area.  Although the hotel is large with many guests, it is still not crowded either at the pool or restaurants. There is a long sandy beach with free sunbeds. You can laze in the shade under the trees or rent surfboard and test the waves. The room was big. The stuff were friendly and service minded. The food was fantastic.  The gym was good and had a private pool.  It was also good opportunities to go jogging around the hotel areas in Nusa Dua.  It's very relaxing atmosphere in the hotel. If you want to have a party, take a taxi to Kuta. "
5,"We recently visited the Grand Hyatt Bali, stay for 10 days, it was wonderful. The beach is very clean, plenty chairs and tree shades to protect you from getting sun burn. They really keep the beach clean. We have been to many beach resorts, the Grand Hyatt Bali is one of the best, wish it was little closer to California."
5,"Staff extremely friendly and polite. Everything was perfect, clean, ready. Many pools to choose from, a nice hotel beach, a stunning garden, great food in restaurants, drink in different bars and club. A wide range on hotel facilities. Single, couple or family - everyone finds there what to do. Great spot for holiday."

5,"My wife and I have been coming here since our children were very small. Since they've grown up and are out of the nest so to speak, I guess it's been 25 or more years. It's a bit of a trip to get here from the U.S., but as soon as we hear the gong at the front announcing the arrival of a guest, we feel like we're home again.  While the property has changed some cosmetically (mainly updating and a great improvement in WiFi coverage and performance), it has retained the charm we fell in love with early on and the staff remains friendly and always ready to help. It is rare to walk the property and not be greeted with a good morning or afternoon by each staff member you meet.   The biggest change I've seen this trip is a bit of a redesign of the Grand Club. The check-in area is now…"
5,"Like most Aussie’s who stay here, we had booked a package through Luxury Escapes/Scoopon and we definitely were not disappointed. Rooms were decent sized and lovely with the day bed ample for our 6 and 3 yo’s. My kids loved how the cleaning staff would position the boy’s teddies a different way every day. Great grounds and pools especially the main slide pool which we lived in. One tip for the slides is to take inflatable mats or pool ring (which bought in Oz as cheaper at home rather than bail) making both kids and adults fly down the slide. Due to the high costs of drinks at the Hyatt we would BYO cans of Bintang and vodka in plastic cups to the pool after we had have the obligatory happy hour cocktail with the staff allowing. The day spa experiences included in the package…"
5,"1. nusa dua - closer to airport and less crowded 2. beach front hotel , with kids club   3. very balinese style ( not posh, but feels like home) 4. friendly staffs 5. pasar senggol for souvenirs , dinner with balinese dance available."
5,"Great place, good hospitality. It was a special occasion for my family and people @grand hyatt made is more special. Beach is very clean, its a kids friendly place where adults and kids can enjoy. great place to experience bali."
4,"We loved our stay at the Grand Hyatt.  Sitting by the pool enjoying the customer service by the banana lounges while watching our 7 year old come down the slide was a great way to start our holiday. At other times he was off thoroughly enjoying the kids club while we relaxed and enjoyed the resort facilities. As with all 5 star resorts it was expensive so not a place to go if you are wanting an affordable get away. The day spa was spectacular, the cultural dinner and performance was excellent and all members of the family were entertained. A lovely place to stay"

5,"Stayed here in Feb-March 2016 for 12 nights. It was our first time in Bali and we loved it. Hotel was half empty, due to the low season. Room was spacious and very well cleaned daily. The lobby of the hotel was the most stunning we've seen!  Restaurants (especially the Japanese one) were very good. Kids (9&11 yo) loved the pools. Beach was fantastic with perfect waves for water sports.  Just outside the hotel was Bali Collection, which was convenient for shopping, but if you want something more authentic that is not a place for you :)  Gotta love it & will be back!"
5,"Recently stayed for 5 nights which was a perfect length in a grand King room for 2 adults and our 2 kids (ages 8,10) shared the day bed. The resort grounds are beautiful and our kids loved the water slide and lagoon pool. The other pool closer to beach is nice nice too but often too warm in the afternoon.  Breakfast at the salsa restaurant was very nice. We had dinners at Bali collection restaurants which is only a short 6 min walk next door to the Hyatt.  Being so close to the Bali collection is handy for buying drinks and snacks at the supermarket. The food and drink prices around the pool are very pricey and we bought our own drinks to the pool. Would stay here again but only a few nights . "
3,"This is a great property, and fully fledged resort. Large rooms, comfortable, and large recreation area including multiple pools and a dedicated beach. 2 restaurants inside (cafe + italian). The challenges we faced were a very slow service (takes more than 30 minutes to check in), we arrived at our room one hour after arriving at the hotel. Other than the front desk, the rest of the service in the hotel is great. The place will need a facelift soon since it looks like the last renovation was > 20 years ago."
5,I was truly impressed with Grand Hyatt and it is difficult to explain all advantages in one review. It is just too good and the management shoul be proud of the level of service and the beautiful territory of the hotel.   Location is super convenient as Bali Collection is just across the street and beach is the best you can get in Bali. As the beach strip is quite large you almost feel like you are alone which is great!  The gardens of the hotel are out of this world! They make a great difference and we mainly picked the hotel because of them and the beach. It's like paradise.   Swimming pools are great but we mainly stayed on the beach.  Staff was incredible. Smiling and friendly!  The open concept reception was state of art and there is attention to every detail.  Breakfast:…
5,"The family and I went to Bali for a long weekend (4 nights) and decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt as it from the location, facilities, services, restaurants by far the best hotel on Bali. We have a beautiful Grand Suite with access to the Grand Club. Right from the start, the arrival experience from security, Bell Staff, reception ... everything was super friendly & welcoming. The room was well designed and our daughter had her ""corner bed"" perfect. The terrace overlooking the pond was so relaxing when coming home after an eventful day. The Grand Club Team was excellent and was looking after us perfectly at all times. We had the chance as well to use the Italian and Balinese restaurant ... the food was delicious and the service again outstanding. Enjoying the local experience…"

They have everything you would need for your stay, restaurants and bars with delicious wide variety of food and beverages, gym, pool, private beach, jogging track, night market, shops, and just walking distance away from shopping complex. Highly recommended."
1,"I have never been in such a bad hotel with bad service.  I asked for ice pack and they couldn't understand and then I asked for ice in a plastic bag their response was ""we have no ice in the hotel"" I asked urgently for female sanitary pack and their reply was ""have nothing in the hotel. Not even 1. Please go to catch a taxi and go to the convenient store yourself"" I asked for any recommendations for restaurants around the area to eat and the guest relations response was "" I cannot give you any recommendations"".   On top of mentioning the above there was no feedback from the hotel manager and they just left a note saying sorry for the inconvenience.  Am I in a 5 star??????!!"
3,"Just came back last night for 8 nights stay with young children, will I come back? No.  I still give 3 stars because of the pool with slides, and playground that accommodate young children. and the Kriya spa that do good job.  The Negatives: The food is horrible, super horrible. for all Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner , they cant even cook Indonesian food. I say this because we ate in the hotel 80% of the time. I tried the Nampu (so-so Teppanyaki, the cook ask how would I like my beef, answered medium well and he did medium rare). Room service is inedible (rare satay). Garden Café lunch was tasteless (the beef rendang and nasi goreng was bad). the worst is Salsa Verde dinner.   The breakfast is terrible, we have 6 adults (3 rooms) and all agreed. the ice chocolate has no taste. The…"
4,"Location Grand Hyatt is in Nusa Dua. This is south of Kuta and Seminyak which are the main party areas. Clientele in this area are more upper class if you may. The area is filled with wonderful 5 star hotels. For me, The Grand Hyatt is the best situated. It's large and spacious with a wonderful private beach and right across for Bali Collection - an open air mall with many restaurants, stores and cafes. The location is beautiful and quiet and away from noisy tourists.  Room I got a king size room which was very cabin like. Great mix of modern and traditional furniture. The room is huge and so is the bathroom. There is free wifi and the beds are comfy with a very cold AC. There is also a small balcony overlooking the resort - you can ask for a pool view, beach view etc. There is…"

1,"Run down... Generic. Lack luster. How can this be considered a 5* resort? Food was horrible, including breakfast. Hygiene and cleanliness was terrible. Lacked any charm. Don't waist your time at this resort. I wish we would have just rented a villa and done it on our own. We thought it would be easy and convenient with the kids facilities but we were so disappointed we didn't even take advantage."
4,"As i said..name is enough to describe the property.Huge and spacious,stunning location.We came to relax and have fun,which was fulfilled.Staff was very courteous and friendly.I would love to come back to this hotel again with my family."

Fantastic location, majestic buildings and corridors, clean, luxurious rooms, excellent staff, plenty of activities for the kids and a selection of great restaurants."
5,"The resort is massive with the longest and finest beach in Nusa Dua. Resorts are full of birds and fancy carps, it delivers the feeling to me that we are part of the nature. Spend there 2 days, staff were super friendly and helpful. They have the longest beach in the whole Nusa Dua, which makes it different from other resorts in Nusa Dua, the other resorts in Nusa Dua are sharing the beach, Grand Hyatt is separated from the other resorts. The resort is super comfort for family traveling, it facilitates with several large swimming pools and a kids club. Basically, Nusa Dua is quite good for family traveling or people who enjoys quietness, not like Kuta and Seminyak, there are only party people.  If you stay here, book an ocean facing room with lounge access, you would not be…"

Basically, Nusa Dua is quite good for family traveling or people who enjoys quietness, not like Kuta and Seminyak, there are only party people.  If you stay here, book an ocean facing room with lounge access, you would not be…"
5,"All the staff are approachable from front office,housekeeping,engineering and f&b staff. Special mention to Eiky,Adi and Mink in restaurant near the beach they are very attentive and friendly. The food has a great variety me and my family enjoyed so much for our breakfast. Hotel was very relaxing."
5,"We have had the best holiday ever at The Grand Hyatt Bali. Staff and service second to none. All the food and dining experiences just the best.   We will be back, Luxury Escapes holidays excellent value."
3,"We stayed here for four nights with our family of four. The resort is very well laid out, with a beautiful garden and various pools. It is also starting to show its age, e.g. the toilets next to the restaurant close to the pool are kind of dated and not that clean.   Our room was large and there was a nice and big enough extra bed for our kids. We also had a (small) balcony with a great view of a pond with fish and other wildlife and the ocean in the distance. Less nice was the noise of the a/c of the restaurant which drowned out all other sounds when sitting outside, as well as the apparently poor noise insulation with our neighbors, of whom we got to enjoy their coughing and sneezing at night as if they were in our room.   The staff is courteous, but having stayed at Hyatts…"
4,"I'll say it up front. I am not a fan of Nusa Dua. But for various reasons we found ourselves staying there at The Grand Hyatt Bali. The resort was pretty much everything you would imagine. The rooms are beautiful and spacious. Gardens lovely.  The pools are fantastic, although the water was actually quite hot in the middle of the day. My only issue is with Nusa Dua, rather than the hotel itself. It is a rather soulless place - resorts and nothing else. So, for two nights it is fine, but longer would be like torture for us.  Oh, and despite being assured that we were in a ""sea view room"" , the rooms are a long, long way from the actual beach front. More of a ""possible sea glimpse"" over the lagoon and gardens. That was a disappointment as we would happily have paid more to secure…"
4,"Stayed here for first time. This hotel is the best ever from places I have stayed in Bali. Huge areas which can be tiring walking up and down from hotel room, beach, pool and to lobby.  Kids friendly as well with bicycle rental where you can cycling near beach side.  Only thing they can upgrade is the aircon which quite warm when you stay on 4th floor."
5,"This hotel is a must when visiting Bali, staff are very friendly, very helpful and nothing is to much of a task. The setting is execellent, the facilities are execellent. One can stay here without going out to see the sites and still have a very enjoyable holiday"

5,"""Nusa Dua"" is a specially designed and kept clean & protected. From the Grand Hyatt's security gate to the reception, it's a somewhat long way but nice atmsphere. A hotel staff kindlly attended from the reception through the room, then helped connecting our PCs to the hotel Wi-Fi. Welcome fruits and coockies were prepared, air conditioner was strong enough to cool the wide room. We stayed five nights at a garden view room and enjoyed noy only pool but also tennis. The courts were clenead just before we use by the hotel staff, and gave us chilled water bottles. Thank you very much for everything the hotel and staffs provided us during our stay.  Look forward to staying the Grand Hyatt again in near future!       "
2,"We purchased a luxury escape, as we had done in the passed, we upgraded and paid extra for the emerald room. When we arrived they said they were going to upgrade us even further and were going to give us a better room, on inspecting the new room it was not better, so I said we will have the room we paid extra for. Lucky we saw both. When we got to our room, we thought we would order a drink. It was $20 for one spirit with coke. We nearly died. Anyway my husband and son went to the pool and I decide to unpack, when a light fell on my head, then an hour later the power went out, after 3 phone calls and hours later some one came to fix it, by now it was night and I was not happy!! one day wasted, no shower, had dinner in the room what a waste of a day. The next day the ceiling…"
5,"We had a fantastic carefree time in the Grand Hyatt Bali. The rooms are perfect for a family with young kids, our 2yo and 5yo shared the day bed comfortably making the portacot unnecessary. The staff here are always friendly and attentive. The space of the resort sometimes makes you feel like you have the whole place to yourselves. Restaurants are all great and with short walk to Bali collection you are spoiled for choice for places to eat. Pools are never crowded they are a little warm tho.   We would never usually go back to the same hotel as we like to stay new places, but in this case we will definitely be returning. "
3,The overall experience was pleasant. The food was excellent at all the restaurants. However the mini bar fridge was substandard. The temparature was set so low we just did not bother to use it. Water was cooler left outside than taking it from the fridge.  We complained twice and was told the fridge was working. The complex is so big that you have trouble finding your way around. People ask other people in passing how to get to places. Signage is very poor.
5,"My husband and I took up the luxury escape deal for our honeymoon. I was a little bit worried as we had never taken a package like that before.  It was FANTASTIC!! Staff were incredible, honestly the best we have had in our whole time travelling. Nothing was ever to much.  We were upgraded to the grand club room on the bottom floor which was just a stones throw away from the exclusive pool. They gave us a beautiful gift from the Kriya Spa.  You will never be bored at the Grand Hyatt as there is always something to do. The food is pricey but worth every cent. Our favourite was the Japanese!     The beach is great in the morning but once the tide goes out really nothing to see. I joined in on the morning pool aerobics which was heaps of fun.   Squirrels and lizards roam the hotel…"

Start day with first class breakfast  make choice by pool for sunbake and swim stroll gardens relax with sunset drink and soft   ocean  breeze  , select dinner spot at resort or nearby . Great staff . Bali at its best"
4,We bought a package deal which we have never done before and it was very good. Room was fine. Make sure you ask for ground floor close to water if have kids so they can play. Staff very nice. Beach good and spa very good. There is a water slide which keeps the kids amused for hours
5,"I've had the privilege to stay at various Hyatt beach locations around the world and I would say this one is at the top. Although the rooms are a bit dated the character of the grounds, proximity to a luxurious beach and fantastic service more than makes up for this.   We stayed at a ocean view Club room. I must say the Club dining area was one of the best I have ever stayed at in terms of food preparation and service.  The omelette maker in the morning was THE BEST I've ever had. The head Chef M for evening presentations was no more than spectacular. His food was prepared with passion and devotion.  Well worth the extra price.   Our room had not only exclusive Club room privileges, yet a exclusive Club pool and no more than a 5 min walk from the beach.   I would recommend this…"
4,"We purchased our stay through Luxury Escapes. Had no problems getting our preferred date and communication with the hotel was excellent.  Transfer: Waiting on arrival was a man holding a 'Grand Hyatt Sign'. We were given bottled water and driven 30 minutes to the hotel in an air-conditioned van   Room: We upgraded to the Lagoon Room which had a lovely balcony overlooking a pond. Room was little dated, but clean. Separate bath and shower and all amenities including toothbrush/toothpaste and razors. Our Grandaughter, who is 3, slept on the day bed which converted to a double bed which is a great idea. We were able to feed the fish from the balcony which was nice. Hotel is quite large so make sure you ask for a room as close to the pools as possible. We took our Grandaughters…"
5,"We stayed for 4 nights in an Ocean View Room. The room was very spacious and modern and had a king bed and an additional small size bed where the kid was able to sleep with no issues. There were some issues with the Air Conditioning of the room but they were promptly resolved. The hotel itself offers many options of entertainment, different pools. different water slides, a very good Kids Club, etc to keep you busy for three or four days. There are also several alternatives with three different restaurants (the Japanese one was excellent) and if you want to try something different you just have to go across the road and you are in a shopping center with several restaurants.

3,"We didn't like this hotel. It's HUGE. It will take some time to get from your room to the beach or anywhere else. It just doesn't have any special feel, just an ordinary huge hotel, too many people, breakfasts are very so-so, and the rooms are very dated. I won't be back, and I wouldn't recommend it to my friends. We actually purchased 10 nights trip on luxury escapes. But it was far from luxury, so we checked out 3 nights later loosing some money (around cost of 1 night) as a fee to leave sooner."
5,"Can't fault this resort. Great pools with waterslide (both kids & adults can enjoy). Bali Connection is directly across the road, if you feel like venturing out of the resort. Visit the water blow just a 5min walk outside the hotel on the beach!"
4,"A beautiful location with excellent facilities. Great environment for kids. Only negative is a lack of proactiveness and a non urgent attitude from the majority of staff. Excellent and safe shopping opportunities just a 3 minute walk ""across the road""."
4,Perfect location very near the beach which is what exactly what i am looking for. Stayed at the lagoon most of the time. Room service food and service is good. View is perfect. Will stay here again in my next trip. Thank you for enjoyable stay! :)
5,"Very opulent, Balinese feel at the resort. The Staff is very sincere and kind. Awesome food, Awesome Staff, Awesome facilities, Awesome memories for us to take back. Fantastic. Five out of Five Stars. Highly recommended for families - A perfect place for that much needed break!!!"

Its forever courteous and hospitable staff, its breathtaking views of the beach, its innumerable swimming pools, amazing amenities. just a few steps away from the Bali collections!"
4,"Stay there for 2 nights, Grand Hyatt Bali was a very large hotel, locate next to the beach. The room was more than 35 sqm i think. breakfast buffet was nice, we have to walk from the hotel and go right next to the beach, its where the restaurant located. Service was at its standard. The property is very big. But the we couldnt enjoy that much view from our room. I think its better to go outside and do some activities around the hotel if you stay here."
5,"Stayed in a large, very comfortable suite as a Hyatt Diamond member.  The major attraction of the property is its long, pristine beach (about 700 meters long)  which has just enough wave action to be entertaining (and for surfing at its end) and a sandy bottom everywhere.  No jellyfish.  Trees perfectly spaced for natural shade. The ocean water is warm, as is the water in the pools which are very attractive.  The property is enormous and well landscaped.  One downside was the Grand Lounge, where the F&B offerings were sub-standard, even recognizing that this is only a Category 3 (of 7 categories) property priced lower than many other Hyatts in Asia.  Potential guests should recognize that that this hotel, located in the rather isolated enclave of Nusa Dua, is inconvenient for…"
5,My wife and I in our seventies have been many times to Bali. The quality of the Grand Hyatt ranks highly with the best of the previous luxury hotels we have stayed in. The cleanliness of the rooms was of the highest standard   and the restaurants were very good. The Japanese restaurant was exceptional. Even room service which can be disappointing in some places was very prompt and enjoyable. Would have welcomed more outside shaded areas to sit in lovely grounds but nothing else to say. would return.

4,"My husband and I have returned from The Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua after a 10 night stay on a Luxury Escapes package.  Excellent stay. The check-in staff were very welcoming, and the process was fast and efficient. Room was fantastic, only issue was mini bar not working (It was replaced) and sliding doors (wardrobes and terrace) need some maintenance. Apart from that no problems or disappointments at all. The house keeping staff were very obliging, in fact all staff we encountered were brilliant, friendly, and professional, and no request was a problem. All the restaurants served fantastic food, the only average food we encountered was at the Indonesian Buffet (the bar-be-que meats were tough and unappealing). But such a small issue in among 10 days of wonderful food, including some…"
4,Great family holiday with an excellent pool and slide to entertain children. Clean beach and lovely gardens and ponds. Very friendly staff who are eager to please. Also has a great Japanese restaurant and a Bali BBQ restaurant with traditional music and dances. Would definitely come again for a family friendly holiday. 
4,"I like the hotel. Like the resort stile of it. Good place to stay with kids. Before we've been to The Moolia hotel. It was new and beautiful and had much better restaurant, but it did not have a soul. I did not feel very relaxed there. Grand hyatt is definatly good resort. It would be one of the best if the food would be better."
5,Room is spacious with complete amenities. Beach no doubt to say that it is beautiful and we can savely lay down on the sand or sun deck. Swimming pool is very nice. But room direction is quite confusing. Made us lost in the middle of the garden because the hotel area is very big.  Everything is good here

5,"This was luxury and rest at its best.Our room or should I say suite ws fantastic and overlooked the gardens and pool area. The food in the numerous restaurants particularly the Japanese was excellent. Facilities were top notch with massage,manicure and pedicure particularly relaxing. The Balinese people are so friendly and make you feel welcome."
5,A true 5 star resort! Great for families and friends. The resort have everything you need and our kids enjoyed the pools with the slide! Rooms are nicely decorated and more space than a hotel room. The only downside is that it is so big! Beautiful gardens and ponds.
4,"We booked Grand Hyatt Bali for a 8 nights with our 2 kids (3yo and 5 months old) through a luxury escape deal and overall we are quite happy with the experience.   Booking: Hassel free, just emailed the contact and all booked for us.   Airport pick up: On time, efficient, clean, spacious, air conditioned car.   Check in: Not the best experience. First of all the lobby is an open space so it’s not air conditions. It was a hot day that we arrived and by the time we got to the hotel, we were exhausted from the flight with 2 kids who are both tired and over stimulated and we just want to go to our room. The check in took a long time and the lobby was crowded. When we came to Bali last time we stayed at Westin and the check in experience was a lot better. We were lead to our room…"
5,"Upon booking the hotel I requested a room on an upper floor as previous visits to Bali have involved many mosquitoes! We arrived in the early hours of the morning and were shown to a ground floor room as the upper room was still being prepared and were told that we would be able to move the following day. When we woke up in the morning and opened our curtains to the view of a lagoon with birds, fish and water monitors we were very impressed and decided to stay in that room. The room itself was a good size with a day bed in an alcove for our 8 year old son, the bathroom was clean, a good size with plenty of toiletries. Breakfast was great, probably one of the best buffets we have ever eaten at, vast choice, excellent service in beautiful surroundings. The pools were all sparkling…"

4,"We booked Grand Hyatt Bali for a 8 nights with our 2 kids (3yo and 5 months old) through a luxury escape deal and overall we are quite happy with the experience.   Booking: Hassel free, just emailed the contact and all booked for us.   Airport pick up: On time, efficient, clean, spacious, air conditioned car.   Check in: Not the best experience. First of all the lobby is an open space so it’s not air conditions. It was a hot day that we arrived and by the time we got to the hotel, we were exhausted from the flight with 2 kids who are both tired and over stimulated and we just want to go to our room. The check in took a long time and the lobby was crowded. When we came to Bali last time we stayed at Westin and the check in experience was a lot better. We were lead to our room…"
5,"Upon booking the hotel I requested a room on an upper floor as previous visits to Bali have involved many mosquitoes! We arrived in the early hours of the morning and were shown to a ground floor room as the upper room was still being prepared and were told that we would be able to move the following day. When we woke up in the morning and opened our curtains to the view of a lagoon with birds, fish and water monitors we were very impressed and decided to stay in that room. The room itself was a good size with a day bed in an alcove for our 8 year old son, the bathroom was clean, a good size with plenty of toiletries. Breakfast was great, probably one of the best buffets we have ever eaten at, vast choice, excellent service in beautiful surroundings. The pools were all sparkling…"
5,"Could not fault a thing, well maintained rooms & grounds. Staff friendly, helpful & genuine. Close to Bali Collection. Hotel restaurants great, good children's meal prices. Plenty of seating at pools & beach. Luxury Escapes inclusions terrific."
5,"The Hotel to feel like a dream, every thing is the best you can imagine. From the entrance till your memories, every detail is wonderfull and prepared to fulfill your desires! The pictures of the place are incredible and will make you never forget the most wonderfull time you spend there."
5,"very nice place and people, good ambience, great location, acceptable rates, and delicious foods. I would like to be back here with my family or friends. I would also like to stay here longer and more often. everyone should visit this place"
5,"Great Location,Facility & Service. Highly recommend.Staff are very friendly and accommodating always greet you with a smile . Resort is very clean with ample choices of pools and beach .  Only complaint is that the fridges supplied don;t seem to get to cold but all else is excellent."
5,"very tranquil , private beach and stunning grounds,...  would go back the kids loved the waterslide and the pool is fantastic.  The food and drinks are little on the expensive side but you are at a 5 star resort.  We stayed for 5 nights before going over to Kuta and it was a great way to kick off a relaxing holiday.  Freee shuttle to all of the shopping downtown only 5 minutes away.  great staff and service."

3,"My wife and I booked this trip thinking it would be a romantic get away. This was not the case. Although the hotel is beautiful and the location is fantastic, it caters mostly for families with small children and is not in anyway relaxing. The pool water is luke warm and not refreshing but will provide hours of fun for the kids. Food at the hotel is hit and miss. Staff are friendly but there is a definite language barrier which makes things difficult. Rooms are average for a Hyatt but livable."
4,"I recently returned from a 8 day stay at GrandHyattBali and had the most amazing time. The resort is huge with some fantastic swimming pools, gym and restaurants. The facility doesn't have a buggy service apart from one that only services the massage/relaxation area so be prepared to walk long distances to your room, tennis courts and to see the resort. I got lost a few times.  Its located right on the beach which is really beautiful with sun loungers and very clean. It is also across the road from Bali Collection but I didn't like that shopping area very much because it was very sterile and lacked the local character. If you walk along the front of the beach there are in fact much better restaurants that are really interesting and cheaper like the pirate/tree house restaurants…"
5,"We visiting this resort in April this year and found it a wonderful choice for our family. The grounds are gorgeous - mature gardens and natural shade cover. They have been really well cared for. All the staff were extremely friendly and accomodating and went out of their way to learn my kids names and speak to them each time - the Balinese generally seemed wonderful with the children. The hotel is well kept and a good choice for either couples or families. It wasn't over-run with kids but enough familieis to make us feel comfortable, yet the pools were definitely all nice enough for adults to enjoy a relaxing time away. The kids club, which we only visited once, was great for my 5 year old. The restaurants were all of a good standard but the Japanese Tepanyaki is my pick -…"
5,"We went on the Luxury escapes package and can't fault it. We usually stay at the Sanur Hyatt but as it is still being renovated we thought we would stay here. It is very family orientated but we found a spot under the trees on the quiet and clean beach everyday so we weren't bothered by kids. The food/drink is expensive, by Bali standards but that is the area that you are in. If you are wanting $2 Bintangs /cheap food, do not stay here as you will only complain and not appreciate the area or the resort. The luxury escapes massages/dinners were a highlight. Love the Hyatt and can't wait to be back at either the Sanur or Nusa Dua sites"
5,"Room is very clean and spacious overlooking the fishpond. Amaze with the size of the king bed and the kids bed on the side. It is amazing stay to both of us, the only issue we had is the water quality on the first night due to scheduled service. Otherwise, it is an amazing hotel with excellent quality"

4,"Stayed over at grand hyatt nusa dua for three nights. The hotel is amazing and also amazingly big! Feels like disney world. As much it is bug they have many staff and did not seem to have much knowledge of the hotel? Or not trained well.. They just told me to dial 0 on the phone and ask the operator.. But they still deliver exceptional service.   The pool is amazing and a few steps away from the beach. Its overall absolutely fantastic, however staff will need better knowledge of surroundings and the hotel itself. Also need staff that are able to communicate in english."
5,"hotel has been established for quite a long time but surprisingly well maintained and overall interior were updated, the garden are well manicured, the trees on the way to the beach are on the same height which is make them very unique, staff also very helpful, overall it was a great experience"
4,"We spent 3 nights at the Grand Hyatt at the beginning of our 18 days in Bali. This was our 7th time to Bali and we like to move around! I write purely from the perspective of a parent with two small kids. Only 6 hrs from Sydney , great food , amazing resorts and the beautiful Balinese people! Grand Hyatt like its name is Grand. It's one of the oldest resorts but was refurbished in 2013  Pros: 1/Impressive layout, lush gardens , pristine beach and winding pools. Lots of different areas of shade and sunshine to chill out 2/Water slides that keep kids amused for hours  So much so, there should have a pool bar at the end where all the parents wait for their kids  3/Across the road from Bali Collections where there are shops and restaurants and spas  4/Cold pool 12-14 degrees if the…"
3,Only stayed here 3 nights out of 7 that we booked. My mum had hurt her back & the resort was too big to walk around & too big to get to facilitates with an injury. Staff not very friendly & we were not offered another room. Nusa Dua situated a long way from other activities so I found it very boring. Ocean view rooms were amazing view but too far away from rest of the resort. 
5,"From the moment you  step in to this hotel you know it's somewhere really special , really friendly staff are room was fantastic with Sea view  balcony which we particularly  enjoyed  sitting on watching the ducks birds fish and salamanders.  In the pond below. The pool areas are also amazing with a slide and caves wonderful  warm pools none of that horrid freezing pools that you have to be brave to enter(. Although on the main pool there are six spray  Jacuzzis be careful  only enter from the pool as I hurt my back and it still hurts saw several  people  do the same) the breakfast  was  wonderful  with a huge variety of  choice. The Japanese  water Gardens  are so beautiful.  The beach is also stunning and very clean,  a few seller's  not a real pest just a polite no thankyou.…"

5,"If you want to see the true bali, this is the place you have to visit, nice beach, you can safely swimming with your children in the morning when the water is clear, ‪you can have a surfing in the noon while the waves are high, and you can have afternoon walk in the beach along the shore while the waves are gone. Swimming pools are very beatiful and very large and have a water slides for children. Hungry? No need to worry, if you were getting bored with the hotel menu, you can just walk very near to the Bay restaurants next to the hotel, or go to the Bali Collection just across the hotel where you can find a lot variety of balinese food or fresh grill seafood with a reasonable price. And also you can find all the stuff you need in your vacation there. The hotel has very large 17…"
5,"What an experience. From the moment the car door opens in the lobby the staff make you feel like a rockstar. Walking in for the first time my 8 year old whispered ""mum, I feel like we are famous"" cold towel and refreshing drink on arrival and an escort to our room, we were quickly settled in. 5 pools, 2 water slides and a private beach. What more could we ask for. We got a package deal on luxury escapes.com which gave us lots of inclusions for dinners, lunch, afternoon tea, massages and manicures/pedicures. The atmosphere is simply amazing and all the staff from the check in to the cleaner are all super friendly and will literally stop to let you walk past. Plenty of water provided every day and delicious room service that is reasonably priced. We had a late checkout of 2pm and…"
5,"We had a superb holiday thanks to our accommodation and the care/attitudes of the hotel staff. Our room was spacious and provided all we needed. Breakfast was plentiful - buffet fusion - served in relaxing surroundings. We ate at the Watercourt Restaurant each morning enjoying the 'pond' and visitors including water monitors. The grounds are beautiful - very relaxing for strolls with lots to observe. The beach is clean, incorporates a coral reef and is close to the water blow. A well equipped gym, a spa, selected shops, onsite money changer (offering competitive rates) and evening market further add to the  appeal of this complex. It will be very difficult to find a match!"
4,Overall a good hotel that are in need of maintenance. Very nice beach and gym. The lobby bar is beautiful and a great place for an after dinner drink. The Japanese Restaurant is a must !!! Avoid the buffet with dance the food is poor. Very helpful housekeeping staff.
4,We bought the 10 night package from luxury escapes and were a little worried after reading some of the poor/ average reviews on trip advisor. My family (husband and almost 3 year old) loved it! As a young family we loved going for daily swims and the playing on the water slide. The grounds are well manicured and maintained. The gardens look amazing and that view of beach is beautiful (we did not swim at the beach as there was too much rubbish in the water but the beach itself was pleasant and well maintained too). Our toddler fed the fish and ducks daily from our garden view room. We even saw lizards and squirrels regularly on the grounds (very amusing for toddler).

The team in the Grand Club were friendly and remembered our preferences each day."

It is just great! was a wonderful experience for us, the courtesy and kindness of the staff was amazing. we really recommend their Japanese restaurant and their spa! All their services are great and well provided. the surfing instructor is very nice and patient and  the drinking  water is always bottled, so you do not have to be concern of ingesting water that is poorly treated or may be contaminated.

3,Stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali for 2 nights on March 27 and 28. The check in process did not go smooth we were trying to check in at 3pm and were delayed by 45 min. was offered free non -alcoholic drink and service personal were polite but you still want to get to your room. Room was fine nothing special. Did have their buffet breakfast twice and there was plenty of choices but the price seemed alittle high at about $25 pp.
2,"I was very disappointed in the breakfast buffet --- limited choices and poor quality --- not what I would expect for a 5 star resort.  The included breakfast was offered either in the Watercourt or Garden Cafe; they were different restaurants but served basically the same selection of boring food.   My family and friends ate dinner at the Garden Cafe and again, the food was terrible and the service was incredibly slow.  No apologies offered whatsoever after waiting ~ 1h for our food.  For the amount that was charged, I expected a lot more. We ate at the Bali Collection after the horrible experience at the Garden Cafe, and not only was the food better but also a lot more affordable.  Will never recommend this place to anyone."

When we were first shown the room we were disappointed as the Luxury Escapes description over sold it also we requested to be put on the ground floor with direct access to the emerald pool but were put on the 4th floor with views of the pool as the ground floor is only available to guests paying full prise. But once we had gotten over that.... The rooms were well maintained with an excellent daybed if you have a child staying with you The breakfast buffet was fantastic and a great way to start the day  The staff were externally friendly and helpful  The grounds were well maintained and beautiful The pools were clean and worm (they also have a great water slide) The beach was clean with reasonable surf at high tide and great rock…

5,Recently visited the grand Hyatt Bali with my partner. The setting for the hotel is breathtaking the grounds are immaculate and very peaceful. There are numerous ponds with koi and local fish living within them that run through the whole resort. The pools are amazing that stretch over very late area around corners with rocky coves and mostly covered with shade. The water was quite warm. The rooms are spacious and modern the aircon system is great and the room was always cool. Comfortable beds and large expansive bathrooms are very luxurious. The beach was pristine and the water is very warm. There is a water sports hire company where you can hire quality surfboards and kayaks for a reasonable price. The dining was brilliant from what we saw especially the Italian restaurant…

5,"Had visited the Bali Grand Hyatt many years ago; a very good revisit for several days, had a comfortable suite, with no problem. Had daily breakfast and appetizers at the club lounge. It was interesting to watch the fauna and flowers of the pond, beautiful  location.  Club staff extremely kind and helpful. The pools are absolutely beautiful,  two water slides and a large rambling main pool area. The club two tier pool with a waterfall was more quiet and restful. The beach is great, cleaned daily to remove the seaweed that washes ashore.  The Bali Collection shopping centre, across the street, is a short walk. Nusa Dua area appears secure."
2,"We stayed in the grand club rooms. They had good pools. Say about 5 of them. However, shower areas were very filthy. The breakfast consists of hardcore non vegetarian food with no signs of veggies. There are no fans in the breakfast area and everyone from the staff to the customers take a steam bath. Pretty odd for such a big property. When we requested for Indian meals, we were served prawn chips. The staff had alot of problems comprehending what we said. We stayed 5 days and were served frozen food got from the market which did not really taste/feel good knowing we were staying in a chain so big and equipped with chefs! I'd rate food as zero for veggies!...the juices were either too watery, seemed to be mixed with water or not made properly because the fruit seeds were also…"
5,"We booked this hotel through the Luxury Escapes website as a package deal that included accommodation for 10 nights, all breakfasts, some other meals, spa services and cocktails.  It was excellent value, and I couldn't be happier with the service we received at the resort.  Their pools and beach are absolutely beautiful (though the only downfall of the entire resort is that their main pools are a bit too warm for my liking), and my 18 month old toddler absolutely loved the 2 x water slides this resort has on site.  The smaller one he could go down on his own as long as we were there to catch him at the end, and the larger one he went down (many, many times) with either my husband or myself.  The location of this resort is excellent, as it's just opposite the Bali Collection…"
5,We had a fantastic time and the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua.  The pool / slide area was fantastic for the kids and the beach was beautiful.  The rooms were perfect for a family stay and the resort  is very well presented.  The staff were always polite and friendly and you can be as active or relaxed as you like.  The children enjoyed kids club (it would have been great if the hours had been slightly longer so mum and dad could dine out for dinner without kiddies) but you pay for the service.  Remember to check out the Bali collection a short stroll away - try Tropicana for a great meal option!
5,"Wow! This place is amazing. When you arrive the staff is really Nice and proffesional. The rooms are amazing. The beach is clean. The swimming pools are so cool, feels like swimming in nature. You got 3 restaurants, they look so cool an suply diverent styles of food"
5,"Had visited the Bali Grand Hyatt many years ago; a very good revisit for several days, had a comfortable suite, with no problem. Had daily breakfast and appetizers at the club lounge. It was interesting to watch the fauna and flowers of the pond, beautiful  location.  Club staff extremely kind and helpful. The pools are absolutely beautiful,  two water slides and a large rambling main pool area. The club two tier pool with a waterfall was more quiet and restful. The beach is great, cleaned daily to remove the seaweed that washes ashore.  The Bali Collection shopping centre, across the street, is a short walk. Nusa Dua area appears secure."
2,"We stayed in the grand club rooms. They had good pools. Say about 5 of them. However, shower areas were very filthy. The breakfast consists of hardcore non vegetarian food with no signs of veggies. There are no fans in the breakfast area and everyone from the staff to the customers take a steam bath. Pretty odd for such a big property. When we requested for Indian meals, we were served prawn chips. The staff had alot of problems comprehending what we said. We stayed 5 days and were served frozen food got from the market which did not really taste/feel good knowing we were staying in a chain so big and equipped with chefs! I'd rate food as zero for veggies!...the juices were either too watery, seemed to be mixed with water or not made properly because the fruit seeds were also…"
5,"We booked this hotel through the Luxury Escapes website as a package deal that included accommodation for 10 nights, all breakfasts, some other meals, spa services and cocktails.  It was excellent value, and I couldn't be happier with the service we received at the resort.  Their pools and beach are absolutely beautiful (though the only downfall of the entire resort is that their main pools are a bit too warm for my liking), and my 18 month old toddler absolutely loved the 2 x water slides this resort has on site.  The smaller one he could go down on his own as long as we were there to catch him at the end, and the larger one he went down (many, many times) with either my husband or myself.  The location of this resort is excellent, as it's just opposite the Bali Collection…"
5,We had a fantastic time and the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua.  The pool / slide area was fantastic for the kids and the beach was beautiful.  The rooms were perfect for a family stay and the resort  is very well presented.  The staff were always polite and friendly and you can be as active or relaxed as you like.  The children enjoyed kids club (it would have been great if the hours had been slightly longer so mum and dad could dine out for dinner without kiddies) but you pay for the service.

4,"We went here on a deal from Luxury escapes and couldn't be more happy with the value for money. The resort is lovely with the most beautiful gardens. Our room overlooking the emerald pool was quiet and clean. We stayed before the Christmas rush and often swam in the gorgeous emerald pool on our own!  Our 3 year old twins slept in our room on the day bed which was perfect for them. They loved the resort pools, waterslides and the clean beach at the front of the resort. They especially loved feeding the ducks and the huge fish in the fish ponds.  The staff were warm and friendly at all times and they even sent a huge chocolate cake to my husband for his 40th free of charge!  The staff were amazing, friendly and helpful. This is a great family resort."
4,"that was the first time stay in bali. the hotel was really big and beautiful like paradise, the foods and fruits were delicious, shopping center was next to the hotel, ocean view calm you, but the hotel is far from night club, it take you about 50 min to the center of bali clubs, and the entertainment group of hotel was really poor only boring dance."
5,"when we arrived we were gob smacked at the grand hyatt ,with the beautiful gardens and rooms and pools ,I can't say enough about how great our holiday was ,nice food ,friendly staff ,everything was spotless ,bali  collection over the road ,didn't have to go anywhere ,just swim and eat and relax will definitely be going back ,plenty of security so always felt safe ,no hawkers on the beach ,and through luxury escapes also ."
5,"Its been second visit to bali and in both instances i always prefered NUSA DUA BEACH for its serene tranquility.   Grand Hyatt is just on the beach with private demarkation. It has 4 zones.. East, West, North and South Village.   we were in east zone and is 1min away from the paradise. We stayed late till 11pm and felt so safe.   Rooms are good and food is ok though it has very menu.  As a locality Nusa Dua is highly secured with full security protection.   Best is it has kids activities and 4 to 5 theme restaurant.   All we wished is a beach restaurant. . Just on the beach.. with live grilled seafood.  "
1,"We arrived at Hyatt Bali expecting a great experience. We received anything but that. The room was terrible. Mold in the rooms and the A/C was broken. I notified guest services and they were not able to fix the problem so we were stuck in a extremely hot room. Also, we asked guest services to make up the couch so our kids could sleep by themselves. Notified the staff at 8pm. At 11pm still no assistance. They finally come at 12:30am. By that time I was so angry I told the cleaning guy to leave. This place is not anywhere close to 5 stars. It needs to be de-rated to 3 stars at best. "

5,"Adi Satawan Reservations Manager  was a delight pre visit, we had a beautifully appointed suite at this magnificant resort,  The restaurants, club, bars, and in particular  Pasar Senggol and Nampu were very good, staff attentive and reasonably priced.  So many family groups a little league of nations.  Wish we had taken some of the grandchildren.  Set in acres of trees, so many flowers and that divine beach.I recorded the waves breaking on the shore that sent me off to sleep each night of our 8 night stay to play on those cold Melbourne nights.  The spa ladies were soo good and as the spa a little way from hotel the chaffeured golf buggy transported me in style. Can't wait to go back.  Awkward for staff when people staying elsewhere stroll in from beach and want to use club pool…"
5,"Top luxury. Everything is excellent about this hotel. The food, the bars the restaurants. The beach is horrendous with street sellers. Security is very lax. Bali in general I would avoid. Not a safe place."
1,"If you are looking for a nice friendly place with friendly staff, choose another place.  Bali is full of quaint, service oriented places and this hotel is definitely not one of them.  Seeing that it is low season, you would have expected everyone to be helpful and accommodating, but it was not the case.  Go next door where you will find a great group of people and a beautiful place"
2,"We are long term travellers to Bali and booked this trip through Luxury Escapes.  The rooms are 3.5 stars at best, they do not have direct pool access and it is at least a 5 minute walk to get to the pool.  This is definitely not what we expected.  When we queried this we were told the better rooms closer to the pools are for full paying guests. The upgrades are for the extras (which are the restaurants, and spas)  This type of accommodation is fine for young people, who are happy to accept Very basic and tired rooms in dire need of an upgrade.  There is mould in the bathroom marks everywhere, black marks on the mirror and chipped aged furniture.  If it wasn't that we are travelling with family I would cut my losses any go back to the villas in Seminyak where we usually stay. …"
4,"Hotel is superb with a gorgeous, wide, clean beach and beautiful landscape.  Walking distance to the Bali Collection also great for shopping and dining.  Room is comfortable and big enough for 2 adults and 2 kids.   Fantastic swimming pool with the water slide is great for the kids and lounge chairs in the shade. Night market is great too.  Just the food and beverage is overpriced."

5,"Our decision to celebrate so many things together at the Grand Hyatt Bali was justified in every respect with all this resort had to offer to make our stay a dream come true. With our room and close proximity to the beachfront( beautiful sandy and very clean that i couldn't resist for a daily walk along and a swim with the water warm and clean )We were really amazed with the very colourful landscape in between pools for all ages.Lucky to celebrate Xmas and New year there we also made sure to celebrate our wedding anniv, and my birthday in a perfect atmosphere and staff that always performed in such a way that makes you feel home and happy.Excellent food thank you all and hope one day we shall meet again for the perfect holiday in an outstanding hotel.   "
2,"We stayed at this hotel in March of 2016 and we were not impressed. We chose this hotel because we are Hyatt platinum members and thought that it would be a good place to use our points on. We were wrong. Hyatt usually does a great job making their members feel appreciated, but not at this resort. It wasn't even acknowledged that we held status with them throughout the entire stay. The hotel is quite large and the rooms are pretty set back from the beach. The whole resort just seems tired and in need of a remodel. We chose to eat at other resorts in the area because the restaurants at this location were bland. The one time we wanted to go their Salsa Bar (their only decent looking place for a cocktail), they informed us hay it was closed for a private event. The manager told us…"
5,"All the restaurants within the resort were excellent, huge pools which during our stay were a little too warm, this is obviously out of there control...Teppanyaki was excellent, very close to Bali Collection shopping centre which itself has numerous restaurants. Kriya Spa within the resort was sensational and massages on the beach were cheap and good quality. Beach was cleaned all day everyday and the ocean was great, would definately return."
5,Great location excellent service and facility. Friendly hotel staffs good food and drink. The swimming pool with the water slide is great for the kids and family very nice sandy beach convent to the local shopping center great for family vacation.
4,"We stayed for a week after purchasing a Luxury escape package.  Overall we were very happy with the resort.  It features beautiful gardens, beachfront access (although not great for swimming) and a great location within easy walking distance to Bali collection.  This is a very large resort but the beautiful gardens make up for this and you can forget the massive scale of the place.  Our room was comfortable, I think an update should be on the cards as parts of it were looking a little sad, especially the bathroom.  Our view from the balcony however was private and stunning, we overlooked a pond and enjoyed the wildlife immensely.  The resort offers surprisingly good wifi included in the cost of the room, it worked everywhere in the resort, unlimited and up to 5 devices could be…"

5,"The Grand Hyatt is a very nice property right on a beautiful piece of the Nusa Dua beach. It's quite expansive and seems less crowded than some of the other properties we've seen while walking along the beach. We stayed in the Grand Club building and the included breakfast buffet was simple and good. We even were able to make dinner out of the evening canapes they offer.  One thing to watch out for is that very few rooms have a decent view. We originally had a north facing suite on the third floor and asked to be relocated to a room with an ocean view in another wing. In the end we had to downgrade to get a view, but it was well worth it. The staff was extremely helpful throughout that process!"

3,"We return after staying here over 10 years ago. Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua still has its mature vast gardens, stately lobby with marble floors.  After staying 3 years we are mixed on this stay - we still like the old world charm, vast gentle beach, though we find more debris and seaweed along the beach which made swimming unpleasant  - relax atmosphere with lush well manicured gardens. We stayed in club floors that has well appointed room and usual amenities with evening cocktails, though not as extensive as other grand Hyatt we know.  Overall, staying here is exclusive but a captive audience with mixed reviews on the food. The older staff are well experienced, but the younger staff are rather junior and cannot quiet answer simple questions (eg. What time the Starbucks across opens in…"
5,We thought that this deal was too good to be true however it was better than we could have hope for. We had the 8 day package with the upgrade which we can highly recommend. We had a ground floor lagoon facing room in the south village where we watched the fish and birds which was very relaxing. Just beyond the lagoon/big pond there was the beach which was literally a couple of minutes walk. The sand itself is manicured every day and the gardens were immaculate. The staff made us feel very special from the start and really went out of their way to ensure we had a great stay. Security was excellent with two sets of security to go through before reaching the hotel. The package we had was excellent as we got to try all the great restaurants and food and of course the spa which was…
5,if u seeking a place to relax and having fund I recommend every one who want GO TO BALI  to book this hotel and the garden view rooms way better than the ocean view and the WIFI is great  and if u want to save more money going around bali by a city map and do everything ur self never use a travel guide coz they will take all ur money for no reason

3,"Room looks old. I think the resort is about time to have major refurbishment. Yet, the positive sides are the strategic location in Nusa Dua (adjacent to Bali Collection with plenty of stores and resto) and the beautiful garden near the beach."
4,"We were there in Aug 2014. So sky was blue, sunshine and nice breeze. When the tide went out in the afternoon, you can enjoy nice walk on the beach to the sea and discovered sea creatures. It was so wonderful to have breakfast and watch birds and squirrels going out & looking for their breakfasts. Really tranquility place to stay.  It is a big hotel with beautiful landscape."
3,"We stayed here over the weekend because of company gathering. Grand Hyatt is a big name so we expect a great lush resort with great food option. We do feel the room is comfortable and the hotel grounds are greatly tended. However we feel quite dissapointed with the food option. Especially the breakfast option. For a 5 star hotel I think the option is quite limited and unappetizing. Also, as we are moslems, the protein that was served were mostly pork contained. Not many beef or chicken option. The food taste were also bland. One of my most anticipated experience in staying in hotels were the breakfast, so it was quite a let down for me.  But overall the resort was very nice but the food can use some upgrade in taste and options."
5,The Grand Hyatt was beautiful and the hotel was just beautiful.  The staff were very friendly and could not do enough to help you.I would recommend that you try out the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua. Were close to the Bali Collection which id also great for shopping and eating
5,"Everything about my hotel stay was first class. Tops were staff friendliness and helpfulness. The beach was clean and shaded, as were the pools and the restaurants offered a good variety of quality food at reasonable prices. I would gladly stay at the Hyatt again. I thought the hotel's ""Corner Store"" was well stocked with reasonably priced family staples."

I have MS and have the aid of a walking stick, as it is some distance from the foyer to the front gate, I asked if I may have a ride in one of the buggies from the foyer to the front gate. They refused on 2 occasions and yet I saw staff running around in them and we even had the buggy ride to get to the Spa.  They say they cater for Disable people but they don't. I was even put in a room to back of hotel, some distance away from the amenities. Very disappointing. So go to another hotel where you will not be embarrassed to get knocked back for a simple request."
5,"Visited here for 8 days after purchasing a deal on luxury escapes.  My stay was outstanding from start to finish, from being greeted warmly on arrival to the top class service that was delivered each and every day.  I stayed in a pool access room in the north village. The room was a good size with a huge day bed looking onto the patio  and garden area. The bathroom and wardrobe area was spacious too.  There was a beautiful pool outside with beds, towels and umbrellas. This was one of many pools around the resort, all beautiful and providing a different outlook and experience. The beach too was lined with beds and ample shade cover from the trees.  Restaurants were plentiful and I highly recommend salsa bar for cocktails and the Japanese restaurant.  The gym was fully equipped…"
5,"We enjoyed a long weekend in the Grand Hyatt Bali.  My husband insisted to use the Club Room upgrade with cocktail hour (basically includes a light, healthyful dinner with alcoholic drinks option, and all day coffee/tea). The location is superb with a gorgeous, wide, clean beach, lounge chairs in the shade.  The Italian restaurant offers GLUTEN FREE pasta and bread! In this resort, you don't have to go anywhere else."
5,"This visit was at the end of back to back cruise of 31 days and we were both wishing we could head off home instead of another 5  nights away . Thank goodness we didn't because this Hotel provided with the ideal opportunity to relax and be well and truly pampered  We stayed in the Club area but, the whole of the facility was fantastic with th most beautiful landscaped gardens and water features great  birdlife and a super beach"
4,"My wife and I went to Bali together with colleagues as part of a trip incentive. After a nearly four-hour flight from Manila, we arrived in Denpasar early in the morning. A short drive later, we were in Grand Hyatt. It is an expansive resort complex with a beach frontage. At the back of the hotel are numerous shops and restaurants. The hotel has a nice swimming pool and a fitness center. One can take their buffet breakfast indoors or al fresco along the beach. Food is great. Hotel lobby is simple but elegant. Staff is top notch. Will go back to this hotel if ever we return to Bali."

The location is superb with a gorgeous, wide, clean beach, lounge chairs in the shade.  The Italian restaurant offers GLUTEN FREE pasta and bread! In this resort, you don't have to go anywhere else."
5,"This visit was at the end of back to back cruise of 31 days and we were both wishing we could head off home instead of another 5  nights away . Thank goodness we didn't because this Hotel provided with the ideal opportunity to relax and be well and truly pampered  We stayed in the Club area but, the whole of the facility was fantastic with th most beautiful landscaped gardens and water features great  birdlife and a super beach"
4,"My wife and I went to Bali together with colleagues as part of a trip incentive. After a nearly four-hour flight from Manila, we arrived in Denpasar early in the morning. A short drive later, we were in Grand Hyatt. It is an expansive resort complex with a beach frontage. At the back of the hotel are numerous shops and restaurants. The hotel has a nice swimming pool and a fitness center. One can take their buffet breakfast indoors or al fresco along the beach. Food is great. Hotel lobby is simple but elegant. Staff is top notch. Will go back to this hotel if ever we return to Bali."
5,"great rooms helpful and courteous staff, great pool but the sea is even better just next to the property. can definitely unwind and relax here once in few years as it has a very relaxed  pace and soothing feeling about it"
5,"Once again we experienced the natural warmth and friendliness of the staff who cannot do enough to make sure you have a great time here.  Having stayed here dozens of times over the past 20 years the consistency of the high service levels is extraordinary.  This is a special place.  The food here is also exceptional, especially the Salsa Verde and Nampu restaurants.  The choice of so many swimming pools and a splendid beach make this ideal for a relaxing holiday.  The rooms are very comfortable and well appointed.  The Grand Club is an oasis and possible one of the best club lounges anywhere, rated for its ambience and setting.  It is not the newest or most luxurious hotel  but it simply has so much more to offer that propels it into first place for us on Bali.  Having tried ""6…"
4,Good hotel. Just very very large. breakfast was ok. Room did nit have a desk but a large sofa. otherwise good place for a family holiday with children. Pool slide also did not have enough water. Checkin was very slow and can be improved. Great spa.
4,"Big sprawling hotel, but you can tell the quality from the moment you arrive.  Our room was beautiful, large with a big bathroom and nice balcony, overlooking stunning gardens.  The gardens and the pool are highlights of this resort and the resort is right on the beach.  There is a nice cycle path and toucan rent bikes at the resort.  The gym is great with its own little pool if you want to escape.  Food is good especially breakfast, freshly cooked pancakes were a highlight for me.  We stayed at several hotels whilst in Bali this was my favourite because I don't particularly care for the hustle bustle of busy resorts.  Lovely hotel you pay for what you get."
4,"The hotel is older style the rooms garden and restaurants spotless The grounds of the hotel and the pool area are lovely. Plenty of tree cover and room around the pool and beach front. Food in Japanese, Garden restaurant and Night Buffet excellent The daily breakfast was very good the apart from the lack of fresh fruit juice (I mean freshly squeezed fruit). The massages from the Spa we thought some of the best we have had. The Manicure excellent. Generally the staff was very good.  Checking in a slight problem  This was resolved.. Very happy and have booked again in 2 months on same luxury Escape Package. ."

5,"Our recent stay at the Grand Hyatt was really relaxing and very special. The staff were attentive and friendly and the accommodation was excellent. The restaurant options were really great, and the Bali Collection across the road adds to the options. The beach was beautiful and nice enough to swim in."
4,"We arrived in the evening to a stunning reception of fire lit batons a welcome drink and cold refreshing flannels at this point i was amazed. Led to our room by a friendly hotel porter we were surrounded by little lakes and ponds, even at night it looked stunning. Our room which wasn't beach front but nonetheless had a beautiful view of the complex was very spacious the bathroom was well kept and clean the beds were huge and very comfortable and all amenities were provided. The staff are extremely helpful and will go above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable for you as possible. The hotel is situated in a complex with 3-4 more hotels all.of which are driving distance away however you are free to go to dinner at any of them you must book in advance. Within the complex is…"
4,"This hotel has the biggest territory (very green) in Nusa Dua and the widest and longest beachfront for which we have chosen it. It is really amazing! The room was quite dated (we had a double on the 5th floor) with old furniture which smelled and our clothes later as well. The sea view was lovely. Since for us its a must when searching for hotels, Grand Hyatt Bali is an option, because the neighboring hotels offer almost no view for standard double rooms, just suites which are too expensive unless you plan to stay more time in the room than on the beach. Another option in Nusa Dua we stayed in is Ayodia Resort Bali and at Ayodia Palace wing they have much nicer rooms (though the view is only side sea view available) than at Grand Hyatt Bali for approximately the same value. In…"
3,"I've stayed for one night at this hotel. I took for club room ocean view. The room was so so, nothing special at all, if I compared with money that I've spent to what I have got, the room was not worthy, it was good but not really special. the building was so old but look good maintained, but it is very similar with other hotel in bali. Swimming pool was very good and this swimming pool really large, the water was so clear and there's jacuzzi, even though it haven't infinity pool but swimming pool area was really beautiful with the color of green from so many trees there.  Restaurant lay out was good, Since I can't eat food with content of pork I only eat pastry and porridge, taste of pastry was good but not the porridge."
5,Lovely hotel - the accommodation was very spacious and clean and the grounds are immaculately maintained from every corner there is something to catch your eye.  Pools were great and plenty of undercover seating beneath the most gorgeous trees that act like an umbrella.  Dining experiences in the hotel was fabulous - our favourite being the Japanese it was amazing and so much food!!!  Only criticism is that the drinks were a little on the pricey side but that is what you get when you are resort based I guess.  Would definitely love to go back.

5,WE had a wonderful time at the Grand Hyatt - We were overwhelmed by how fantastic the hotel was. The staff were amazing and went out of their way to make sure we had a lovely holiday. The room was amazing and slept three people easily. We will definitely go back to this hotel.
4,Still very good service and very good beach front.  Don't really want to leave the hotel as it's luxurious inside the resort and a bit rough out on the public beach.  Dive into the cold water pool and then dare the kids to do the same.  Great holiday place and a free tee shirt too.
3,"The Grand Hyatt is a spectacular property, sitting on 16 hectares of lush landscaped gardens, swimming pools and accommodation spread over 4 ""villages"" or clusters. Compared to its newer and more expensive neighbours, namely the Sofitel and the Mulia, which in my humble opinion are modern and bland, the Grand Hyatt conveys a tasteful Balinese flavour while offering the modern conveniences expected of a 5-star hotel. All areas of the hotel, from the lobby, restaurants, pools and even the beach, are immaculately-maintained.  Regrettably, the service was very disappointing.  Upon my late evening arrival, I was dismayed to discover that I had been allocated a ground-floor room adjacent to the exhaust fan for one of the restaurants. In addition, the air-conditioning could not get any…"
5,"It was my second visit to Bali. A special occasion - a wedding. I was greeted by Grand Hyatt staff at the airport, from where I was whisked to the hotel in less than 30 minutes. Upon arrival I was directed towards my suite in the Grand Club, where the check-in was completed. My suite was spacious and had a nice view of the gardens and ponds. The wedding took place on the beach just south from Salsa Verde Bar. The rain only started 5 minutes after the ceremony finished, so we all made it to Salsa Verde where we enjoyed and excellent dinner accompanied by live music and later drinks and dancing. It was an unforgettable scene. I enjoyed two 3 hour spa trestments at Kriya spa which were equally memorable. Finally, before departure I enjoyed a Japanese Teppanyaki dinner at Nambu."
5,"Amazing stay. Beautiful gardens, polite staff, clean room. Would like to  return with my friends and child for a holiday. Thank you Hyatt for unforgettable stay. Already miss the sea and blue sky. Recommend to all"

4,"Enter the hotel lobby and you shall be greeted with a great smile every single time. Staff were generally polite and helpful, however, could do with a little more speed in terms of checking in and out.   Product wise we stayed in one of the Suites and it seemed to be refurbished recently. Spacious, cosy and pleasant. However, shower amenities was rather normal for a Suite standard. Lounge access was rather disappointing as we would expect them to be serving at least some simple light snacks all day round and we were told only simple drinks were served for 'offpeak' hours of the day. (Afterall, those occupants who get to access the lounge would have paid quite a fair bit for their rooms. Thus, this is definitely its minus point).  Environment was peaceful with minimal…"
3,"We stayed in this wonderful hotel in January 2016 and enjoyed our stay very much. We even wrote a commentary with title ""the best place to stay in Bali""  The people are very friendly, the layout of the estate is great, the restaurants are excellent all though a little pricey. So why only 3 stars? We wanted to book for January 2017 right away and found that the prices had increased by 50% !! Not only for 2017 but overall. We now need to look elsewhere."
5,This hotel is a little old but it is still so beautiful! Stayed in the standard room and it is already spacious. it come with an extra cutch bed area so if you are a family of 4 it is great as you do not need to add extra bed. It also has a balcony - i stayed on the ground floor so it feels like i own the entire garden when i was sitting at the balcony. there are ducks and flowers and small rivers and view of the beach.. just stunning!! King size bed is huge and i really enjoyed the food and the pool and the beach... just amazing!
1,"the worst place, awful staff and their attitude, not a hyatt style  it's a same to have a hyatt sign on it!!!!!!!!! the hotel team each of the employe could not understand and take order or any request correct! they everyone did not care about the guests, noteducated, not polite, careless.The cvacation was spolied 100%."
5,"Great hotel. Where to start? Very good service. Good food. Well maintained. Basically exactly what you would expect from a high end, 5 star hotel.  A couple neat things: it is in Nusa Dua so away from the Kuta/Seminyak mess. You can get to Kuta/Sem pretty easily using a metered cab that the concierge will call for you but it usually takes 1hr to 1.5 hrs because traffic is always so bad.  The hotel is right across the street from the Bali Collection, an outdoor mall with shops, restaurants and a supermarket so that is super convenient.  Travelled with wife and 6yo daughter and didn't need to get a rollaway cot as the room came with a second bed built into an alcove. My daughter loved 'her area' and it was really well-thought out and appreciated.  Beach is good. Waves break about…"

4,"We stayed here at the end of January with a group of family and friends. The hotel and the grounds are divine. There is a very long stretch of beautiful white sandy beach that belongs to the hotel. The pool is massive and the water slides were a huge hit with the children. Rooms are a good size and have a double daybed that fits two smaller children if you want to have a family of 2 adults and 2 kids in one room. Or we were offered a second connecting room at 50% off which worked out well. Breakfast was great at the hotel and there are a few options for restaurants. Lunch poolside was also okay. We didn’t find dinner that great – limited and quite quiet. The hotel is opposite Bali Collection open shopping mall that has plenty of restaurants, massage places, boutiques, a…"
4,"This is a good hotel with excellent service and facilities to cater for families. Staff is friendly and attentive to our needs. We have young kids who just love the hotel's many pools and big slide. Our boys (11 and 9 yo) had a good time learning how to surf at the sea in front of the hotel under supervision of hotel staff. Our daughter (5 yo) had fun dressing up as a Balinese Princess at the hotel Kids Club, which offers many activities for children. Food is excellent at the hotel as well."
4,"We love GH and have fond memories.  Some staff remembered us from years ago. It's evident that the staff is well trained and experienced and their level of service is genuine.  BUT this time I'm a bit disappointed bec GH seems to cater to big group bookings.  Albeit they are in the non-Club room area, many times the lobbies were packed with group check-in/out, which is an eye sore when are you're trying to have an tranquil vacation.  This is is our 5th stay and in the past all bathrooms smelled like flowers, now there loose faucets, no flowers and toilet paper on the floor.  So sad.  The Club lounge food is no where as good as before, cost reduction effort is very visible.  We have fond memories and like the service but doubt I will stay here again.. :("
4,A very nice hotel in a very nice location. Very natural and a pleasure to walk around the beach areas and gardens. General Staff very courteous and premises well maintained. Would definitely recommend for families as well as couples.
4,The Grand Hyatt Bali is a simply stunning hotel. I stayed here for three weeks and was blown away by how beautiful Bali is. The hotel has numerous restaurants and bars and quality evening entertainment. The guest rooms are spacious and modern. My only criticism was the amount of rats I saw around the hotel. One evening we were having dinner outdoors when rats started falling out the trees! Also they were running up the waterslide as well. I certainly didn't let that ruin my experience though. Lovely hotel.

5,Grand Hyatt Bali is at Nusa Dua. Not too far from Bali Airport. Opposite the main entrance is Bali Collection. Beach is also within a stone throw. So it is definitely a perfect choice of accommodation at Bali for an escape from the dreary realities of life.
5,"We stayed here for our honeymoon and had one of the larger rooms (not sure which).  From our enchanting welcome (music, flowers, drink etc) it just got better.  The grounds are absolutely gorgeous with floral scents, fish ponds and attention to detail everywhere.  There was a great choice of restaurants so no need to stray and it didnt feel boring to stay in the same place as they were quite different.  Breakfast was fantastic with choices prepared especially for you (best omlettes ever). My favourite was the Japanese, prepared in front of you with death defying knife displays, it was fabulous. We were here for New Year's Eve and that was memorable!  I think that it is very good value as it felt like a bargain at those prices, I would thoroughly recommend it for couples and…"
4,"For Family with kids, Grand Hyatt Bali is the best choice for fun. Beautifully managed gardens and nature together with best of best swimming pools for kids under age 10 are the reason why we visit there every year. However, the quality of breakfast is getting worse, especially the breakfast at Club is the worst I have ever had."
4,"Great Location, but having visited last year the standard of the food had dropped,very bland in the Salsa Verde and no good vegetable choice. Only eat in the hotel 3 times in 9 days! Better food and price at Bali Collection, outside. Swimming pool dirty and sun bed area."
5,"Stay 2 night at hyatt with my family, what can I say is yhis place truly peacefull and luxury. The resort have their own private beach and top nearby restaurant are distance walking. The pool area is perfect for kids and adult. Surely will book here again next time."

5,"We stayed at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua for 2 nights and got upgraded to a suite on the top floor overlooking one of the lagoons. Staffs were friendly and helpful. The location is great, just opposite to the Bali Market where we bought souvenirs, fruit and groceries. The Italian restaurant in the resort has great kids menus and the high tea at the lounge next to the lobby is the best valued I have ever had! Our kids went onto the 50m water slide the who.le afternoon and we also loved the private beach with sunlounges over shady trees."
4,"Even though this was the wet season, we enjoyed our stay - we should have stayed longer! The interior of the rooms was a bit dated, but clean and functional. Power outlets were a bit scarce. Wifi access was great. We paid for an ""ocean view"", but actually could not see the ocean due to the trees, so I would not suggest that anyone pay extra for a view (the garden view is basically the same anyway).  The established trees are one of the things that is great about this location - they are pruned to form natural umbrellas over the seating areas around the pools - a simple idea, and helps encourage a more natural setting (e.g., birds, frogs, etc). We were quite surprised to see egret and herons ""feeding"" at the ponds (we even saw a heron take an hour to swallow a fish that looked…"
5,"This was our second stay at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. We can not get over how amazing this hotel is! Every detail from booking liaisons, transfers, checkin and accommodation and so much more was beyond belief! Although clocking up some 30 ++years between us in the hospitality industry, we were absolutely blown away by the incredible thoughtfulness of management and staff. ( Amrit and Lita were awesome!!)  Our stay included many beautiful meals, some pampering in THE best spa I've come across and endless fun for the kids on the water slides, beautiful pool areas and the new playground.

Thank you…"
5,"We have been going to this hotel for many years, the staff have been delightful every visit, the food in all the restaurants the best. the pool, is always the best temperature, never freezing. the water slide is away from everything, so children laughter does not interrupt a restful snooze by the other pool. Love everything about it. Would definitely recommend it"
5,"I am very enjoy Grand Hyatt Bali's service and the quality of the room and food there! I spent a week there with my Family, we had very good time and enjoy the room service and the swimming poor there and the whole environment is so good, I will go back again soon."
5,"We stayed at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua for 2 nights and got upgraded to a suite on the top floor overlooking one of the lagoons. Staffs were friendly and helpful. The location is great, just opposite to the Bali Market where we bought souvenirs, fruit and groceries. The Italian restaurant in the resort has great kids menus and the high tea at the lounge next to the lobby is the best valued I have ever had! Our kids went onto the 50m water slide the who.le afternoon and we also loved the private beach with sunlounges over shady trees."
4,"Even though this was the wet season, we enjoyed our stay - we should have stayed longer! The interior of the rooms was a bit dated, but clean and functional. Power outlets were a bit scarce. Wifi access was great. We paid for an ""ocean view"", but actually could not see the ocean due to the trees, so I would not suggest that anyone pay extra for a view (the garden view is basically the same anyway).  The established trees are one of the things that is great about this location - they are pruned to form natural umbrellas over the seating areas around the pools - a simple idea, and helps encourage a more natural setting (e.g., birds, frogs, etc). We were quite surprised to see egret and herons ""feeding"" at the ponds (we even saw a heron take an hour to swallow a fish that looked…"
5,"This was our second stay at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. We can not get over how amazing this hotel is! Every detail from booking liaisons, transfers, checkin and accommodation and so much more was beyond belief! Although clocking up some 30 ++years between us in the hospitality industry, we were absolutely blown away by the incredible thoughtfulness of management and staff. ( Amrit and Lita were awesome!!)  Our stay included many beautiful meals, some pampering in THE best spa I've come across and endless fun for the kids on the water slides, beautiful pool areas and the new playground. It's a bit hard to really explain how brilliant this place is! One last mention- Ro Ro, (not sure how you spell that!) proved to be an exceptional restaurant manager and should be commended!

5,We have enjoyed every minute staying here. We have stayed here for seven nights. The staff are very friendly and go out of there way to help you. The facilities are very nice. The pools are wonderful and the breakfasts are very nice! The dinner show is very entertaining and the food is great. I recommend hiring a bike and biking up the beach. There is a lot of nice places to swim on the beach. Plus you can check out the other resorts also. There is so much to do here. The only thing I will say is dont book a taxi from here. They charged us 320K to goto waterbomb. We got a bluebird taxi back for only 100K. Not sure why they charge an extra 220K for the same distance. Wonderful place to stay and would go back!
4,A Lovely relaxing hotel in a great location with great restaurants. The Staff are excellent and accomodating and the pools and beach are located very well suited to everyone. The Spa is extremely relaxing and the grounds are amazing. I would recommend it to both couples and to families. Theres room for everyone without feeling packed. Importantly they take security seriously and have an understated yet serious way of monitoring the ins and outs of the resort without you noticing.
5,"After our concern about first far far located room with the very dusty air comes from sofà and furnitures with so much humidity.....that  made our staying impossible....the kind assistant manager  after couple of hours..upgraded us to the fresh room,located in the amz location with ocean view. The next day, the amazing kind manager offered us a dinner as complimentary treat from the hotel, with the best first quality food i've ever tried in my worldwide travel ....5 Stars service. i was a chef,so i really know what i am talking about... Are 20 years i ve lived in Bali,and i ve tryed many and many hotels..resorts..and Villas...and to be honest ,the Grand Hyatt is one of my favourite ,best place in Bali...quite and amz environment...animals and nature are involved in the complex…"
5,We have just got back from 8 days at the Grand Hyatt and we were sorry to leave. We were in a ground level room where we stepped out to the Balinese pool which was stunning. Room 1136 The hotel does pick up from the airport where they immediately put you into a car of your own so you are not required to share or wait around. If you have not been to Bali before or you are not comfortable bartering as soon as you get off the plane this is a good option. It can be quite hectic leaving the airport and negotiating a taxi and the first time around can be hard work.  On arrival we were shown to our room and had all the features explained to us and the room was already cool in anticipation of our arrival. We were told that the hotel supplied bottled water for free and you could order…
5,"I would recommend this hotel for your next stay. The rooms where so quite and beds amazing. Great hotel for couples, families and solo travelers. Felt very safe in and around the hotel. We hired the bikes for the day (they were very roughly AUD5-6.00 and rode around the area which I highly suggest, its lots of fun as you can stop along the way for drinks and swim in beach. The breakfast is one of the best I have had, please try the pancakes, they are amazing."

5,"If you are looking for an outstanding Hotel Resort at the beachfront on the island of Bali/ Nosa Dua I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt Bali. Outstanding Hotel Design and Structure, very nice stylish rooms and extraordinary good staff and Restaurants. I have to mention as wlle the SPA. I never had a better Massage than here and the whole set up of the SPA is incomparable. Just 300 m far away is a kind of Shopping mall where you can buy staff made by the locals as well a wide range of brands producing in Indonesia. For me it was simply the perfect stay in an outstanding Environment."
4,Loved the place. Amazing service and very nice stuff. Everyone very friendly and looked after us so well. We had wonderful time. Rooms large and clean. Beach is great and private. We definitely coming back. Breakfast included in our stay. Large varieties of food. They have at least 4 restaurants and we loved eating there
5,I love this property the pool and beach are fantastic!!  The location is very convenient to shopping .. The breakfast is excellent you had your choice of buffet which we choose daily. The rooms were comfortable..
5,"Although the interior itself is a bit outdated, but I will still highly recommend this hotel to those who wants to relax or spend a bit time just enjoying the pool and the beach. The breakfast buffet is also very good, a lot of varieties :)"
5,"Friendly staff, good food, lots of green and fantastic beach.... Fitness facility was nice equipped. Interesting animation.  Rooms were comfy and clean. We had a great time!  Paying for internet in a hotel of such a class is old fashion. Have to change!  Hotel is nice located in a walking distance from shopping area."

5,"Breakfast buffet was incredible.  My kids loved the pool. Don't recommend the dinner show, overpriced and strange.  The hotel grounds are amazing!  Loved all the birds and fish.  We even saw a Komodo Dragon in one of the ponds.  Staff was awesome!"
5,I had a lovely time here. Nice staff. Beautiful food Beautiful pools always enough sun beds stunning day spa near the shopping centre (very handy) Kids slide is great beautiful gardens and view. I enjoyed everything about this place- thank you for the relaxing holiday!
4,"We only stayed a night at the Grand Hyatt--a bit of beach time after being up in Ubud (where I would recommend you spend more time than in Nusa Dua...charming) and it was a fine stay.  The property is enormous, well-equipped, and typical 5-star beach resort.  Green, lovely pools, and rooms are spacious and comfortable.   We had a garden room, which was great, and had a view of the ponds (and small alligators!).  The beach is great--sprawling, clean, but tides go out if you're looking for a swim.    Restaurants--just had some poolside nibbles and they were fine (and 5 star resort priced, which was a shock to the system after Ubud, but that's what I would have expected).  Staff was good.  It took a while to check in and check out, not sure why.  They didn't have our bed type…"

5,"Would highly recommend Grand Hyatt Bali, especially for vacations... with family. Lovely sprawling facilities, green, serene. Great private beachfront. You can choose to do what you want. Restaurants open till late. Very friendly and attentive staff. Overall a wonderful experience."
5,This is an exceptional five star hotel which is what you should expect from the Hyatt name. Impressive features and caring staff will make your trip to Bali memorable. Probablt the best in Nusa Dua area.
4,A lovely hotel with old charm! Very large property that has the usual amenities for a 5 star resort. Tried several restaurants that offered quality food. Best to book to avoid delays i.e.. we waited 45 mins for our Teppanyaki as the food was prepared! Need to step up on their breakfast menu(buffet) as it does not change! Staff members were very friendly and would attend to our requests with a smile.
5,"Exquisite resort. The service, amenities, food and accommodation were to die for. We were there for Christmas dinner 2015 at the Salsa Verde and had a beautiful meal and were made to feel very special. The pools and beach area were perfect."

5,"This was our 2nd stay at the Grand Hyatt and on arrival we had an expectation of what to expect and we were not disappointed. In fact by the time we left our expectations were exceeded. Our room was spacious, well appointed and above all clean. Service from the moment we arrived was first class and the team in the Club Lounge could not do enough for us. It should also be mentioned that wherever we went within the resort we were greeted with a smile and a welcome. Pools were to warm to fully enjoy but with so much sunshine they would have to throw ice blocks in to cool them down. Look forward to returning sooner rather than later."
5,"Outstanding service around the hotel.girls in breakfast area are very special,extremely friendly and helpful.""salsa verde"" cafe is very good to have lunch in.gym sauna and size of area for that is huge.beach cleaned each day very well.overall absolute amazing effort of stuff to make guest comfortable.

4,"My partner and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua from the 6th to 14th January on a Luxury Escape package.  This was my 30th trip to Bali and one of the best due to the amazing experience of staying at this great resort.  All the inclusions from the Luxury Escapes package were fantastic. Highlights were the 60 minute massage from Kriya Spa, Teppenyaki dinner, Pasar Senggol and the Indonesian Lunch.  The room was clean and spacious, the location was great being across the road from Bali Collection and the facilities on site were second to none. Staff all fantastic!  Now, you're probably asking why after all this positive feedback the hotel only gets 4/5, I have two major critiques which did effect our overall experience.. some of you may think the following is petty but when…"
5,"I had set my expectation for this hotel adequately, as GH Bali doesn't really rank at the top in TripAdvisor in Nusa Dua area. However, I learned that if you choose your hotel room properly, then you will have a better experience. I had my room in the North wing, which is the last renovated wing, and it was great. The room was nice and clean, and it was close to the Grand Club Lounge. My kid and my nieces love the swimming pool, so that is a big plus for the kids. One of my family member also lived in Conrad Nusa Dua, but the swimming pool doesn't have the slide like GH Bali does.  There was a hiccup during our stay, but Mr. Ranjeet and team were very swift in responding to my needs. Shout out also to Mr. Mudita and Mr. Ari (I believe that's his name ... he is the manager of the…"

5,Great place to chill out for a few days with the family. The hotel is right on the beach and the grounds are huge. The River pool with its slide is great family fun which my whole family have enjoyed on a few occasions. Don't forget to take a inflatable ring to enjoy the slide to it's full extent
5,"I have no hesitation in recommend the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua for your next trip to Bali. My family and I had a beautiful 9 days stay in January 2016 on a Luxury Excape Package. It was one of the nicest and friendliest hotels we have stayed in. The package was great value for money and our family wasn't treated any differently from the other hotel guests.  Thank you for a memorable family holiday, we will be back to stay again."

5,Grand Hyatt Bali - Beautiful Hotel with amazing facilities and service 🙏😊🏖 Close to Bali collection shopping Centre. Bike path near beach connect all the hotels beaches in Nusa Dua and helps in exploring great spots and scenery. Taxi fares are bit expensive but worth bargaining and you may find better rates. We did visit elephant safari in Taro and paid a bit extra to have Bath and breakfast package. It was great fun and we enjoyed swimming and bathing elephants more than riding them.  Overall we had a lot of fun!

4,"The gardens, pool and beach were a stand out for this resort. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to an ocean view room and it didn't disappoint. A lot of people have complained about the decor being dated, but honestly yes it's older but it didn't bother me at all, the rooms are still stunning. High tea was affordable. BYO your own duty free vodka on the way ! Fantastic service. Buffet breakfast had so many options. "
4,"I got an ocean view room at the highest floor, really nice view & big enough for my family.  They are an old fashioned hotel BUT you'll got Truly Bali ambience & strongly recommended for family holiday quality time.  Their private beach, their staff services, the ambience & location are THE BEST!"
3,Pros; - Beautiful Hotel. - Great swimming pool for adult and children. - Foods are delicious in most of the restaurant. - Easy access to Bali Connection (shopping area where offer varies brand and restaurants and massage parlour.)  Cons; - No transportation or buggy service provide from hotel to near by place. 15 - 20 minutes walking required within resort or to go to Bali Connection.   - Breakfast was available in non-Air condition restaurants and only one small restaurant with Air condition. When some days morning temperature can goes up to 34c and there are not enough seat for most of guest who's want to sit in the ac restaurant. -  some staff are business minded and not really honest.

2,"The foliage and common areas on this property are absolutely stunning, perhaps one of the most beautiful places I've seen.  The rooms are a different story. We requested a king and received 2 twin beds pushed together. Our mirrors were rusted, paint was peeling off the ceiling, and there were bugs everywhere, including ants on the bed. Add to this the fact that the hallways are all outdoors and the air conditioning the room and restaurants is practically non-existent.  The food is all wildly overpriced. The Japanese restaurant cost us US$140+ for 2 of the set menus and 2 bottles of water. Because the area has nothing but resorts you have no other food options unless you take a car away from the property.  When we ate our very expensive breakfasts we saw a gentleman ask for ice…"
2,Don't go there if you plan to spend time on the pool. With 34C water temperature you swim in boiling hot water. During low tide the nearby ocean is gone and you only can sit in even hotter ponds. It is ok and nice during high tide. So plan carefull when you want to go swim. :-)

5,The Grand Hyatt is a luxury Hotel and as such is not cheap. It offered everything you would expect from a luxury hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. Upon arrival were were greeted with a refreshing wet face towel and cold drink in the serene surroundings of the foyer. The hotel ensured that we had an adjoining room for our family of four. The rooms were spacious and amenities were lovely. We had a garden and ocean view. We stayed in the Grand Rooms and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable.

From the first communication through email communication with Hana, the Sales Executive. I knew instantly that I was in good hands!

3,"warm beers, hot swimming pools, bad restaurant service, have stayed in other resorts in Nusa Dua and they have been far superior, the location was good, would not recommend this resort or stay there again, small cans of beer were $7AUD and were always warmish, never finished one of them"
5,"The location is beautiful. The gardens, extensive fish ponds and pools are quite amazing. There is a fun water slide and a small surf break. And for the rate the room was excellent. The breakfast was good, and served in a beautifully atmospheric dining room, but the choices were slightly limited for a five star hotel. Walking in the grounds is delightful and there is a big market area nearby with lots of shops and restaurants. We had some minor issues on checkout when staff tried to charge a different rate to the one they emailed us (which we had a printed copy of). It was eventually sorted out and the right rate charged, but it was a shame to spoil a wonderful stay with that disappointment at the end.  "
5,"We have been coming to the Grand Hyatt for  8 times now. This is a record considering we live in Europe and my parents are particularly difficult to please. The property is modeled after a traditional Balinese palace and is set in a lush garden setting with a beautiful, sandy beach which is perfect for long walks and surfing. The staff always goes out of their way to make our stay great, hands down, the best service I have ever had in any hotel! No wonder they have so many regular customers who keep coming back. We definitely will :-)"
5,The Grand Hyatt is a luxury Hotel and as such is not cheap. It offered everything you would expect from a luxury hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. Upon arrival were were greeted with a refreshing wet face towel and cold drink in the serene surroundings of the foyer. The hotel ensured that we had an adjoining room for our family of four. The rooms were spacious and amenities were lovely. We had a garden and ocean view. We stayed in the Grand Rooms and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable.

3,"I stayed for three nights at the Grand Hyatt in December. The property itself is amazing - one of the largest hotel properties I've ever stayed at and the grounds are immaculate. The open air lobby is large and gives a beautiful view of the ocean. Hotel is so large first day can be a little disorienting but you get the hang of it quickly.  I give it three stars because the hotel seems a bit dated, especially the rooms, and the restaurant selections are only so so. I had an oceanfront room but its not literally oceanfront, and inside its dated. The pool area is nice but nothing spectacular - the water was really hot in the pool which is not ideal when you want to cool off. The beach area is large but you can rarely swim - either because of low tide or strong currents - I barely…"
5,We have been staying at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua for over 15 years.  Many new hotels have popped up nearby but none have the soul of this Grand Lady.  It is the staff and people that are the heart of this magical place.  I would recommend it for couples and families alike.
5,"We have stayed at Hyatt hotels around the world but hands down Grand Hyatt Bali is one of the best! We stayed at the Grand Club room and there was endless great service throughout. The room need a little bit touch up especially the bath room, it can be little damp. The staff all over the hotel are generous with their smile and their help! It makes you feel at home right away. The staff at Grand Club Lounge are very professional and super helpful. They always comes around asking to get something for you. Thank you Hyatt for such a wonderful staff. The view is breath taking, the pool and the beach are very inviting. There are lots of thing you can enjoy around the hotel within walking distance. Keep up with your excellent service. We will back for sure!"
5,"Wow.  Not sure where to start. This hotel is incredible.  Hands down the most beautiful hotel we've ever stayed in.  As we pulled up we were welcomed with open arms.  Greeted at the check in counter with fresh cold drink and towel to cool us off.  The hotel lobby in open air.  The landscape is so beautiful throughout the hotel.  There are many restaurants on site for your dining.  The service and food in all the restaurants are wonderful. The hotel rooms are very comfortable and roomy.   The hotel is located on the beach.  If you don't want to swim in the ocean, there a couple pools which are just as nice.  You also have drink and food service offered at the beach and pool area.  The staff makes sure you are well taken care of.  Make sure you take the time for the spa!  Hands…"
5,Love this amazing resort. Staff were amazing .  Food lovely. All the grounds and gardens were immaculate. Food at Salsa Verde was beautiful.  Breakfasts yum. Rooms are spacious and quiet.  I love this resort will be back.

4,"We stayed here for 8 nights over the Christmas new year period. The hotel is huge and the grounds are absolutely stunning. A lot of effort and work goes in to maintaining those gardens. The pool and beach were fabulous. The service was great. Nampu the Japanese restaurant is a must do. Internet speed was perfect, quality of cleanliness of room was spot on. The only thing the hotel could improve on is a revamp of the rooms - the bathroom became a bit smelly and damp after the shower was used."
5,"Stayed here for 8 nights over New Years Eve. Travelled on a Luxury Escapes package that had heaps of inclusions like dinner at the Japanese Tepenyaki, Salsa Verde and the Balinese buffet that also includes a traditional dance show. Thankful we had some of our meals covered by our package as we did find food and drinks in the resort really expensive, especially when the 21% taxes are included. Staff all over the resort are brilliant and friendly. We travelled with our 1 and 4 year old and the staff were so lovely with them, helping to keep them entertained/distracted while we were eating meals! Resort buildings definitely due an upgrade, however everything was very clean. Pool was UNBELIEVABLE! Probably the best I've seen in a resort. It was huge and had so many sections with big…"
4,"I am giving the Grand Hyatt Bali four stars, because my kids really enjoyed the swimming pool.  However, if you are expecting a ""Grand Hyatt"" room experience, then you will be disappointed.  Yes, the room features and hotel facilities are consistent with what you expect from a five-star hotel.  However, the property is showing its age and there are a lot of small issues that eventually add up.  For a family holiday, the Grand Hyatt Bali is adequate.  For a romantic holiday, I would look elsewhere.   Pros Family friendly Friendly staff  Welcoming lobby Large, kid-friendly swimming pools with two waterslides Sizable fitness centre with free daily activities (and an adults-only pool) Spacious entry-level rooms come with day beds that can sleep 1-2 kids (no need to pay extra for a…"
5,"So impressed by this resort!  My partner and I recently spent six nights here and we enjoyed every minute of it.  Yes, it's a huge resort with hundreds of guests (many with screaming children), but the staff here so friendly and eager to make sure that your needs are addressed that it more than makes up for it.  The rooms and other physical spaces are also past their prime, but generally everything is well kept and the grounds are *immaculate.*  The food wasn't spectacular, but it was perfectly fine.  Again, you don't mind that it's less-than-gourmet (and limited in selection), when the staff remember your order and are so friendly.  The pancakes were notably good.  The beach is also by far the best in Nusa Dua.  I highly recommend taking a walk at low tide when the sun is…"
5,This is my first time to stay at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. This hotel is so nice with great view from my room. The children like it very much because the room is big and near pool also close to the beach. There are some slide water at the pool so the children really enjoy it. The pool is awsome and big.

5,This is my first time to stay at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. This hotel is so nice with great view from my room. The children like it very much because the room is big and near pool also close to the beach. There are some slide water at the pool so the children really enjoy it. The pool is awsome and big. 
4,My children spent a lot of time by the pool. It's a very safe environment and one can just play the water slide all day long.  My elder son got crashed into on the  long slide because he was going a little too slow initially. there are some fast kids but the hotel staff is keeping watch at the top.    There was a concert going on at night hence some noise issues for my family. Otherwise the room was spacious and well appointed. Good enough for our family of 4.
4,"First time to Bali and the Resort is lovely, we had a very relaxing stay.   Resort had all the facilities that I expect of a 5 star resort including a well equipped gym.  The prices of food and drink within the resort are very expensive and for this reason would not return .  Pool area is lovely but pool temp is too warm, with the humid bali climate would be nothing better than a cool refreshing swim in the pool, but instead was like a warm bath."
5,"We have had 11 days at Grand Hyatt  and overall loved our stay. The best part was the pool and waterslide. Our 6 year old daughter had hours of fun on the slide everyday. The only negative I have is the drinks are very expensive and you really do feel you are getting ripped off. We would have drank lots more if the drinks were more reasonably priced. We ate breakfast at garden cafe as it was air conditioned. Restaurant by the pool was very hot for breakfast.  Staff are all amazing! The food in all restaurants are reasonably priced but again drinks are really expensive. The Japanese restaurant is amazing and is the best in my view. The room was a bit dated, but we spent very little time in room so we did not mind. The king size beds are very comfy and great pillows.   We would…"
5,"Got an upgrade to Ocean facing suite to accommodate our young children, situated walking distance from Bali collection (restaurants, bar, shopping), lot of activities at hotel (cycling, swimming, surfing, table tennis), Amazing and courteous staff that can make you feel homely."
3,"We felt like a number in a hotel factory.  If it was not for the Indonesian staff, namely Mr Urip (Club), Mr Adi (Club), Ibu Dwi (Salsa Verde), Ibu Budi (Salsa Verde), the Hyatt would have no heart.  Expatriate leadership, except Mark (F&B) paraded around without even smiling at guest or connecting with guests at the  Club lounge. No real acknowledgement of the Festive Season with a reception for Club Guests and a little performance by a local orphanage would have been welcomed."

Lots of gourmet cruisine.  Most important of all, hotel service is very good.  Staff are so attentive and courteous, very sun-shine, and always smiling.  We'll definitely stay in this hotel again if we visit Bali next time.  The hotel is close to Bali Collection (shopping arcade), a place worth for shopping and dining."
4,"My family with 2 children ages 3.5 and 5 stayed at Grand Hyatt Bali between Christmas and New Year for 4 nights.  This was our first trip to Bali.  The grounds were very nice, well manicured, and very lush.  Most rooms seemed to face the gardens and not the ocean.    We stayed in an Club Executive Suite.  Upon arrival at the hotel, they promptly escorted us to the room and did check-in there.  The kids slept in the living room with one of the couches set up as a bed with sheets and the other slept on a rollaway bed.  There was plenty of room in the living area for both of them to sleep, plus room for seating for adults on the other couches/chairs during the day.  We had a very nice separate bedroom with large bathroom and walk in closet... plenty of space.  Our view on the 1st…"
5,"200 meters walk in front of the hotel is Bali Collections where you can find dining and shopping area so it's got a handy location if you got no car to get around. You can choose to have breakfast by the sea shore or in land, probably a close proximity to your room. There is no indoor breakfast available other than room service or a non inclusive breakfast at a bistro. The pool were nice. My kids preferred to swim in the ocean with nice waves and cooler water. The beach was cleaned daily. Don't worry about getting hassle by beach vendors since not many of them allowed to get in and you can decline them politely. Bikes are available for rent if you would like to ride a long the property or neighbourhood which serves as the running/jogging track as well. Breakfast was nice. the…"
3,"I am expecting so much before I go.  It's Grand Hyatt, how bad could it be?  The resort itself is big (huge) but it is quite aged.  The room, facilities and restaurant really need a big facelift to compete with all those nice resorts there. Sorry it will be a long review but I really need to say everything.   Food, bad!  Totally not up to the standard of Grand Hyatt.  The first night we had room service.  My daughters had Spaghetti Bolognese and this is by far one of the worse.  They just put some meat sauce on top of the spaghetti.  Breakfast, limit varieties and quality is just like the spaghetti bolognese.  I do expect more on it.  Christmas Eve dinner.  We chose to have the Night Market buffet.  It's very Indonesian style.  We paid more than 2 million Rp for this meal but…"

5,"Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua, Bali, has been my favourite hotel for years. Picturesque view of the ocean fronted by the most beautiful tropical garden among all hotels I have been to is what brings the feeling right in the first step we enter to the hotel lobby. It sets the tone right all the way.  Gorgeous landscape, excellent maintained facilities, not to mention the lagoon pool that just blow our children's mind to their max enjoyment, great selection of food, those were things that make Bali the best themed park in the world.  Just sit back and relax, we are in Bali !"
5,The Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua in Bali was just fabulous!  Everyone was so kind and wonderful!  The grounds were immaculate and we loved the Koi fish in the numerous waterways.  A very restful and peaceful place!  I would highly recommend this hotel!!

That was the main reason choosing the Grand Hyatt Bali for our 15/16 Christmas and New Year holiday.  We have booked quite a few month in advance and directly on the hotels website. As we booked a stay at the Grand Club and with a toddler, we have got some questions. Which have all been answered immediately by email.  Just a few days before the journey, the guest relationship was sending us a short reminder on the important topics and the details for the booked pick-up.  That's a good start into the holiday already!  The pick-up was perfect managed and we didn't need to waste any time at the airport.  Arrival and welcome was perfect.

4,"This was about the best hotel accomodation I have ever experienced. It is just huge with three pools with jacuzzi and several restaurants by ponds where some exotic animals like baby comodors live. A big private beach is the highlight of the hotel perhaps. It is quite expensive and far away from Kuta but there is a shopping mall called ""Bali Collections"" which is reasonable for food and shopping. The only issue was it was not so soundproof and I could hear the neighbors sometimes but not a big problem. The room is the biggest I've seen for a 5 star level but the iron was broken and this might be a problem for a business traveler."
2,"This is the first time im writting bad comment for grand hyatt bali. Usually if i come to bali, im staying on grand hyatt bali. Normally check in 2pm, but they make me wait until 3pm, and until now my room not ready yet, After complained to the reception, we came together to see our room, but not ready yet. They told me maximum is 1hour. I cant late check out, but this hotel can and make me ""must"" accepted really2 late check in.  And now they look more respect to foreign people, because im waiting in front desk, and didnt get welcome drink (20minutes). But, the other guest, who come after me (of course they are foreign people) already get welcome drink, and cold towel.  Poor hyatt..i love your hotel, your ambience, your beach, but now your service is downgrade. "
3,"I wouldn't even use points to get free nights here. The hotel is fine/lovely even, but the food is completely rubbish. It's expensive and bad. I can well tolerate expensive and very good. Bad and cheap is less good, but workable. Expensive and terrible is a no go for me. It really detracts from the whole lovely hotel experience.   I am a Hyatt member and I emailed them about it. Their response was as bland as the meals. There is so much choice in Bali for accomodation and the food generally is exceptional. This seems to be geared to offend and please no one.."
4,"If you are looking for another side of busy-Bali, this is the place. The hotel is quiet, with lots of tree, and a beach in the backyard. Since the hotel area is vast, the staff has to take you the room after check-in so you won't get confuse. The room is spacious, it has place to relax inside and outside the room. However, the room has a stale smell for me"
4,"We (4 adults and 1 child) just spent 3 nights here. It's a gorgeous hotel, with a lovely pool,  lots of open spaces for kids to run around. It's a perfect place to lounge around in doing nothing. The breakfast spread is good but repetitive. Overall, food is decent. However, the rooms could do with better maintenance. Our tub and shower had muddy water for 2 of the 3 days. Though when we highlighted it to the management, they promptly tried their best to resolve the plumbing issue. Special mention to the doctor. My mom wasn't  feeling too well,  so we had to call the hospital doctor Dr. Dadlani. He was very helpful and in fact continues to check on my mom over the phone even though we've checked out. The entire staff was ever smiling and helpful.  In terms of location, across the…"
4,"This was about the best hotel accomodation I have ever experienced. It is just huge with three pools with jacuzzi and several restaurants by ponds where some exotic animals like baby comodors live. A big private beach is the highlight of the hotel perhaps. It is quite expensive and far away from Kuta but there is a shopping mall called ""Bali Collections"" which is reasonable for food and shopping. The only issue was it was not so soundproof and I could hear the neighbors sometimes but not a big problem. The room is the biggest I've seen for a 5 star level but the iron was broken and this might be a problem for a business traveler."
2,"This is the first time im writting bad comment for grand hyatt bali. Usually if i come to bali, im staying on grand hyatt bali. Normally check in 2pm, but they make me wait until 3pm, and until now my room not ready yet, After complained to the reception, we came together to see our room, but not ready yet.

3,I have traveled to Bali several times & decided I wanted to try the quietness of Nusa Dua. The location of the resort was a draw card for me as it is across from Bali Collection & right on the beach. The resort is huge & it takes a while to be able to navigate around. The grounds are beautiful & well kept & the staff are very friendly. The rooms however are quite tired & need to be refurbished. We had a ground floor room with a wooden deck that overlooked a pond. The wood on the deck was rotten & you had to be careful where you stood & make sure you didn't put too much pressure on the hand rails as it felt like it was going to give way at any time. The Japanese restaurant was wonderful. The other restaurants were nice but not that wonderful for the price. Cocktails & drinks were…
5,"Great hotel, magnificent pools, wonderful gardens, staff cannot do enough for you. However, dining is a bit on the expensive side. I read that the gardens are full of orc hids but could only find a few pots in reception."
5,"It was our first time to Bali and we were baffled to be in such a massive resort.  To start with, especially for those who are travelling to Bali for the first time, after exiting the airport, get your phone and order the cab from Uber, Why? trust me the local taxis charges a way more and it's annoying though.  We arrived at the resort and the ambassadors were there welcoming us with a great smile and escorted us to the reception ( and what a reception, i used to work for hotels before and so envied that open air lobby, it is nice to breath fresh air)!   The check in was smoothly and everything was explained by the receptionist which i have forgotten her name, and what a professionalism! and a map of the resort also was given explaining the facilities and everything. Right after…"
3,"First, the Grand Hyatt Bali has a truly grand and vast grounds that are kept immaculately and is very beautiful.  I was impressed with how well kept the grounds were, given the size of the place! The staff are very friendly and warm.  The room was very well kept too, so kudos to the housekeeping.  However, the not so good:   - The grand club lounge, although beautifully laid out with an interesting koi pond, had some of the worst breakfasts I've had at any Hyatt club lounges around the world (Grand Clubs as well as Regency Clubs).  - We went to the lounge in the evening hoping to find some bottled drinks to take to the room, and I was surprised to find they didn't keep any drinks in the refrigerators...I've never seen this before in any other Hyatts. So, It's not worth paying…"

5,"I got this room as a part of the Agoda secret deal and is one of the finest properties that I have ever stayed at. I was here only for 2 days so couldn't enjoy the property much. Definitely hope to return. My room was very nice. It was above a small pond with ducks. Very nice view from the balcony to start your day, sipping green tea. The property is quite large and has an attached beach. The Italian restaurant was v nice , food and ambience. Flawless service. The extra bed was actually a double bed and not one of those roll always. We took a car from the hotel to show us a little bit of Bali. That was nice. Bad timing with rains though. Lot of shops within the property premises. You are actually quite sorted if you don't leave the property. You won't get bored if you just like…"
5,"Love it! Very spacious, very green, very clean, love the lotus gardens:)  Staff very efficient at check in time. Welcome drinks served immediately. Asked for ice, was sent immediately to room. Asked for extra blanket, serviced real fast!   Had lunch with nephew and nieces at salsa verde.. Was not bad... But I have had better wood roasted pizza and spaghetti..  Overall much better than a lot of the Indian 5 star hotels in India. For example the taj Bengal in Kolkata India, is no where like this one.   "
5,"Perfectly located hotel , right on the beach. Very good food and lovely pools. Shopping area is just walking distance from the hotel . Hotel staffs extremely friendly and lovely shopping arcade inside the hotel. The spa is awesome. Good fun for small children as huge play area and lovely pools are there. Will like to visit this place again"
3,"Stay in Grand Hyatt Club King, atmosphere is pretty tranquil, however is a bit old fashion, room are clean but style are more then 10-15 year plus. Service can be better, some staff are not up to 5 star hotel service. Ask a staff by the pool bring me extra tower, he ask me to get it myself. A club lounge staff insist the latte was a strong flat white"

5,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali for 5 nights before a live-aboard dive excursion in Raja Ampat. The grounds are lovely with beautiful ponds, waterfalls, and pools. We stayed in the club section and thoroughly enjoyed our time at the regency Club. we sat and watched the herons and other birds while sipping cocktails, the service was incredible. Eka in the lounge was so helpful, she would rush to find us a current newspaper or find out when high tide was so we could swim at the beach. We had a garden/pool view suite and it was quiet and peaceful. The grounds are huge and the resort was full but it never felt crowded. It was truly a great experience and we will be back!"
5,"Could not ask for anything more ,had a club room ,the room ,lounge was fantastic with great attention to detail ,staff were superb ,and made you feel so welcome. Location of the hotel is great with clean beach and safe green hotel grounds ,cannot wait to return "

5,"Recently stayed here in a club room. Room was lovely and close to the club lounge which we made good use of. The breakfast was a la carte with a small buffet but the best part was it was quiet and not a bum fight at the buffet. We enjoyed the club pool very much it was so peaceful and we found the water temp cooler than the other pools. The afternoon tea at the club lounge was always a good coffee served with a smile. Evening cocktails were very good and the canapés offered could definitely feed you for the night, but with so many other restaurants to try out we didn't over eat. The Japanese restaurant was excellent but a little quiet when we visited so lacked a bit of atmosphere.   We will definitely return to Grand Hyatt Bali - Nusa Dua is so relaxing and the beach in my…"
5,"This property is truly grand. It is spread across acres of beautiful, lush grounds and right on a peaceful beach. It really conveys a sense of beautiful Bali, including artistry and superb service. We stayed in a suite and made good use of the club, which sits out over a lovely pond full of life, including resident herons, ducks and fish. The food is wonderful and the staff could not be more warm and attentive. (A special shout out to Eka, who helped us in innumerable ways.) The suite was large and comfortable. The spa is a bit of walk (right by the resort entrance), but well worth it -- a beautiful setting in the style of a Balinese water temple and offering excellent massages. You can also walk out of the resort to the tacky mall across the street to get inexpensive, tasty…"

5,"Our first (family) overseas holiday & it was a perfect, safe, clean, fun place to stay for a family. It was luxury all the way, great pools and water slide, restaurants and activities. My highlights were my surf lesson through the resort, eating at the in house Japanese restaurant (each mouthful was a delight) even our 4 year old son sat and ate with chopsticks...yes we were shocked too! Amazing spa facilities and gym and we also loved the kids club. The staff were friendly and warm and started to teach our son Indonesian which was wonderful and gave him bread from the kitchen to feed the resident ducks and hugely oversized gold fish."
5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali was a wonderful hotel...we stayed here two nights and although there was a convention going on, we felt that the grounds were so big we still felt it was quiet and secluded.   The staff were wonderful helping us with recommendations and always offering a smile and help when needed. The pools were great and so was the breakfast at the outdoor restaurant by the beach.   Great job by the team at the Grand Hyatt! "
3,The room we stayed in was fine. Some rooms are far away from everything. Trouble was the water system that kept us awake. When every the neighbors used water the pipes would make a lot of noise. The pool water was to warm to swim in.   Staff was very friendly and helpful. The beach is beautiful and the nearby shopping center has a good selection of decent restaurants. 
4,I went there this year along with my co-workers. The services was excellent! friendly employees. The room was huge and very clean. The food was even better. I love the cafe near the beach.Try to walk down the beach and rent their bike.
5,The beach at the grand Hyatt Bali is beautiful and stretches far and wide. The resort is large with lots of grassy spaces and several pools. Rooms are modern and spacious. Great location and would recommend to anyone.

The Good - All staff were warm, competent, attentive & friendly,  beautiful grounds maintained to perfection,  excellent Japanese Restaurant (Nampu),  spotless & well maintained property & rooms,   Kriya Spa is still one of Bali's best,   Comprehensive breakfast (but not the best we have had in Bali),   Pasar Sengol (an outdoor Indonesian buffet with cultural entertainment) was an unexpected pleasure,   Kids are really well catered for throughout the resort, The Gym was excellent for those thus inclined,  The Not So Good -  The rooms are showing their age (although very well maintained), The…"
5,"I booked this hotel for 6 nights ended up staying for 16 after unable to get a flight home following volcano eruption in Lombok. We booked a club room which was expensive but certainly worth it. The breakfast in the club lounge was really lovely, good choice of continental breakfast but really was far more than continental. In the evening from 5 to 7pm food and drinks are complimentary, the food is terrific and plentiful no need to go out for dinner if you don't want to there is so much food. The staff are so attentive and such warm caring people very friendly and helpful, I could not fault any of them.

In fact even to reach the main gate from the lobby is not an easy task. There is lot of greenery in the premises and added attraction is the private beach running alongside the hotel within the boundary.  Staff is very courteous and polite. The room came with a terrace and there was a small pond on the backside of the room with one or the other water fowl roaming around and I could see the beach as well from the terrace. Beautiful view from the room. But everything was so scattered. Breakfast area was far away. It was again by another pond, but breakfast by itself did not have much of…"

We stayed on a Luxury Escape deal and found it to be great value for money and we were never made to feel any less valued as a guest because we were using a voucher. The pool is exquisite and the water slide a hit with our 8 and 5 yr olds. The pool staff made a super effort with our kids. We would absolutely stay at the Grand Hyatt again and would advise anyone else to do the same. The Passar Sangol was a highlight for our family, the show was entertaining and the food magnificent."
5,very big and beautiful  Hotel with kind staffs . breakfast was good . there was 3 pools and 3 breakfast restaurants . view of rooms was very nice and lovely . at the evening music bands play good songs at the lobby . it was near to bali collection which was the center of shops and restaurants . but there is no night clubs near the Hotel .
4,"Very large, long walks, with an average long beach, it had many facilities and it even had  its own mini shopping high street and bank. Just so big. But it was Hyatt standard and the staff were friendly, apart from at the reception desk. Streamlined luxury on the cheap was my final conclusion."
4,its just huge. we had to walk a long way to reach our room but it was fun. staff was very cordial and helpful. every comfort you can think of. Pool was just awesome. only thing that i want to complain about is the room i had booked was not allotted to me due to some confusion. nevertheless great stay.
5,"Stayed here for 4 days to attend health summit. Check in were kind of slowly, they mistaken my name with other participants, my luggage took a long time to get to the room.   My room is 4427, garden view. The room is big and the bath room is fantastic.   The hotel area is huge, they have 3 restaurant that served breakfast. I tried waterfront cafe, which is located in the garden area, near my room and the summit room. I also had breakfast at salsa verse restaurant which is located near the beach and swimming pool.  I'm very pleased with all staffs there, from the house keeping, restaurant, banquet, they were all nice. Excellent service.  Will come back again with my family."

5,very big and beautiful  Hotel with kind staffs . breakfast was good . there was 3 pools and 3 breakfast restaurants . view of rooms was very nice and lovely . at the evening music bands play good songs at the lobby . it was near to bali collection which was the center of shops and restaurants . but there is no night clubs near the Hotel .
4,"Very large, long walks, with an average long beach, it had many facilities and it even had  its own mini shopping high street and bank. Just so big. But it was Hyatt standard and the staff were friendly, apart from at the reception desk. Streamlined luxury on the cheap was my final conclusion."
4,its just huge. we had to walk a long way to reach our room but it was fun. staff was very cordial and helpful. every comfort you can think of. Pool was just awesome. only thing that i want to complain about is the room i had booked was not allotted to me due to some confusion. nevertheless great stay.
5,"Stayed here for 4 days to attend health summit. Check in were kind of slowly, they mistaken my name with other participants, my luggage took a long time to get to the room.   My room is 4427, garden view. The room is big and the bath room is fantastic.   The hotel area is huge, they have 3 restaurant that served breakfast. I tried waterfront cafe, which is located in the garden area, near my room and the summit room. I also had breakfast at salsa verse restaurant which is located near the beach and swimming pool.  I'm very pleased with all staffs there, from the house keeping, restaurant, banquet, they were all nice. Excellent service.  Will come back again with my family."
5,"Great that i can say, if you stay there less than 4 days, you will lose your ways and have to find some times to get back the right way to your room. I stayed here for 4 nights with my teams and alot of persons also lost the way in this huge resort.So impressive!"
5,"The hotel has access to the beach and they have lots of facilities. The pool is great and the beach is very clear and beautiful.  However, as the hotel is very big, the walk from the front lobby to my room is quite a distance, as well as to the pool and beach.  It is very suitable for those who want to find tranquility."
5,"Room was large, modern, bright and clean. Hotel, grounds, pools, restaurants and amenities are world class. We had a wonderful holiday with outstanding service. This hotel is a great place for families. My kids never wanted to leave the pools and water slides. Right on the beach, breathtaking gardens, food was AMAZING too! I would say this is probably one of the best hotels in Bali for families."
5,"I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Bali.  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone.  The staff were very friendly and happy to assist with all requests.  The facilities were very well maintained, the location was sensational, close to the beach, shopping complex across the road.  We had a fantastic holiday and would certainly consider returning to the hotel for another stay."
5,Prime location among top hotels with private and very well kept beach. The staff  were welcoming and courteous at all times. The hotel facilities and especially the pools exceeded our expectations. Treat yourself and splash out on the Grand Club and have your breakfast and evening drinks in a beautiful and peaceful lakeside setting.

5,Stayed here for 4 nights with my kids.  The rooms are nice and clean with nice decorations.  The kids club was good with different activities everyday to keep my kids occupied and happy at the end of the day.  The spa treatment was wonderful.  Food are great and we spent most of the time enjoying ourselves at the breach.
3,"My room to far from the lobby and beach, and its so dark at night to walk around. Room is clean and fully equip. Maybe they need to have some places to hang wet cloths. I have noisy thing from the other room."
5,"I never expected to come here but was invited to attend a health summit. What a location! Beautiful. Food good, staff very friendly, weather perfect - until I got delayed in my return due to an erupting volcano!"
4,"We had a great week at the Bali Grand Hyatt with a Luxury Escapes package.  Great location on the beach.   Only letdown was the flavour of the food and the need for a great coffee (this not unique to the hotel).  We would recommend the hotel with the package,"
5,"Thanks to Grand Hyatt bali. For taking care of my stay. I really feel special, feel surprised about the amenities, n feel excited. All the staff are very friendly, helpful, and outstanding service. The hotel n room design are unique, nice view from my room 4160, very comfortable to stay with a clean n tidy room. Nice to talk with FO staff,pool attendant, and waitres in the pool bar. It is such an extraordinary service 💖  Dhohirni, sunaji"

5,The deal put together by Grand Hyatt Bali was extremely good value.  The hotel and the facilities are first class and the services was terrific. The gardens are spectacular and the location is excellent right on the beach and with The Bali Collection shopping complex just opposite the hotel entrance
5,A beautifully landscaped resort with great service and wonderful facilities. No need to go anywhere else - you won't be disappointed. The pool areas are well planned and the food and rooms all excellent.
5,"Wow we had such a great holiday here. I purchased a Scoopon for 8 nights with breakfast, transfers, 3 lunches, 4 dinners and the cultural show / buffet. (I have separately reviewed the restaurants). It was the first time to Bali for my husband and I and our 3 1/2 years and 18 month old daughters. Nusa Dua was the perfect location for us being quiet and safe and this resort far exceeded our expectations. The grounds are stunning and so well maintained. Our girls loved the wildlife - ducks, squirrels, lizards and the fish they fed with bread from the restaurant ladies. There was a little bit of confusion at check in with regards to what was included with our package - I think a language breakdown. But once we got to the room we were very happy with everything. We just had a…"
4,"I can not stand deceiving people. For a great resort to have a company ( Golden Bird ) representing them in front of their lobby and tricking people in taking them to attractions they get commission for is wrong. I asked to be taken to a specific place and they agreed and understood, but I was taken else where. After letting the driver know I didn't want to be there and wanted to be taken to my original destination he apologised and blamed the company saying he was told to take us there. Basically 1hour of our time was taken by this planned act. When we arrived back at the resort we certainly made it known we were extremely upset. The company played the blaming game back onto the driver. They still wanted to charge us for the whole duration of time without taking an hour away…"
5,"We returned to the Grand Hyatt Bali because previously we had a pleasant stay. This time it was even better because we stayed in a spacious suite. Both breakfast and cocktail at the Grand Club Lounge were varied and plentiful. Staff friendly, attentive and helpful. Among the various pools we prefer small intimate pool of the Grand Club that seems carved from the rock."

5,An excellent location for a relaxing Balinese experience. Hyatt Club is well worth the additional cost. The quality of food both in the morning and evening was great. Staff were attentive and friendly. Nearby Bali Collection is great for those who want to shopping without the hassle of bartering.
4,"The hotel is right on the beach, just walking distance to beaches of Nusa Dua's white sandy beaches, you can  consult to  security and life guards of the hotel the time best for swimming, the restaurants serve delicious food and wide selections of drinks, good place for business meeting, honeymoon, family  holiday and exclusive and many more"
5,"I keep going back to the place. I love the whole 'feeling' of the hotel, with is spacious rooms, great service, friendly staff and fantastic location. This time we were in a suite, a beautiful room with an excellent panorama over a fish pond.  The pool area is a great place to relax, eat, drink and swim  I will be going back next year for sure!"
5,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for eight nights and I have to say it was an amazing experience throughout our stay. It is a large hotel, the rooms are in blocks of 4, North,South, East and West wings all are within easy reach of one of the three main restaurants which you can eat breakfast in. The selection of food is very good although there is a slight leaning towards eastern quisine you can obtain western style breakfast etc. there are two other restaurants one serving japanese food and the other is the Indonesian open air one which features traditional Balinese dancing as entertainment some evenings and it is brilliant, with food served buffet style. The hotel has its own stunning beach area with sun loungers under lovely shady trees which are great as they are on the beach…"
5,"Rooms where first class ,very clean and well maintain daily service and cleanness of room was Triple AAA bottles of water where always stocked up daily in room when it was serviced.grounds where spotless with beautiful gardens ,swimming pools where all very cleaning both inside and outside of the pool area. Restraunts where well run by Excellent staff food was all ways top nothing was any trouble for staff to satisfy guest."

4,"The resort is calm and quiet The pools are clean and functional how ever were unavailable for 3 days during our stay due to some water issue. The gardens and overall feel of the resort are fantastic.  They have a great gym, all spa options, bikes for hire, child minding including activities, a variety of adult activities, shops, restaurants, money changer, and more all at a five star price.  There are lots of dining options.We had some vouchers that included dinners/lunches . The vouchers are designed to have you dine  so spend with care or seek alternatives e.g. a glass of pineapple juice was $8.50.  Our room was great, large and clean with a table, TV and standard fridge.  There’s WiFi and the aircon works great the security box in the room is convient and easy to operate. …"
5,"Grand Hyatt Bali is a huge, inclusive resort in Nusa Dua resort area, if all you want to do in Bali is chill and relax then Nusa Dua is where you want to be. The swimming pools in Grand Hyatt Bali are very nice, and it has a private beach open to the resort guests only. Free wifi access across the whole resort and I thought the food was reasonable compare to other 5-star hotel. Overall I had great experience during my stay at Grand Hyatt Bali!   1 downside: for those who make reservation with Hyatt GoldPassport Points, free nights at Grand Hyatt Bali does not include breakfast, I was not informed upon confirmation nor when I checked in, only had I aware of this when I checked out from the room."
3,"Grounds lovely, beach fantastic and staff friendly.  For a Grand Hyatt it was a disappointing stay. The rooms were very old and tired and in desperate need of renovation. Check- in was a joke. Room not ready till gone 4pm and even then it wasn't made up when we entered.The plastic sun chairs around the pool make the resort feel very cheap and outdated. Need new beach towels too. Almost all stained every day.  During our stay we had a sad teppanyaki experience where we were made to stare at our food for 30 minutes before the chef started to cook with 0 personality.  Breakfast at the Garden cafe was terrible. 30 minutes to poach an egg and bring it over and then for them to have the whites still raw. Terrible.  Salsa Verde - i lost count how many times items had to be sent back…"
5,"Great stay, will return. Friendly, helpful and courteous staff  added to the success of the stay.  Only critique is the cost of ALL drinks - soft, water, juices and alcoholic. The beach was excellent, great swimming for young and old.   Very clean, and protected by mini reef. Pools are idyllic; but water a bit too warm for me. Beautiful and established gardens  that you can lose yourself in.  Great eateries and varied.. Two minutes walk from Bali Collection."

4,"Has an amazing pool/lagoon. Kids love it and the water slide is good fun. The staff generally are very pleasant and nice. We traveled with an infant, and there would always be someone who would help with the pram when there was a step. Food at the restaurant was quite okay. The Children's facility is quite nice. The lobby is beautiful but the rooms at least in the eastern wing (I don't know about the others) need some renovation from the outside. Starts with the numbers on the rooms, the passage way floor looks very bad. In the suite that we stayed, the lamp shade was broken and was fixed with a tissue, the dining table was leveled using a tissue, the weighing scale and the clock in the room had run out of battery. The balcony good do with cloth stand to dry clothes considering…"
4,"A huge, beautiful, inclusive and impeccably landscaped resort. They have a guy who trims lawn edges, a guy who hand feeds fish etc etc and all staff are polite and provide a great service. The resort is calm and quiet although the same cannot be said for the neighbouring resorts/festivals. We were off to one side and exposed to a couple of loud nights.

4,"I wanted to change date because of my accident.I send e-mail to grand hyatt bali before 3days. and I quickly took message from hotel,I can change date as my schedule. good response!!!!  first impression of hotel was very good because opened front gate desion was fantastic and music the instrument idea was very funny and special  everyone was kind and room was clean but only one the slide of swimming pool was famus in web-site,not good ,too slow ,my boys 11,8 years old just 1 try,and they had no interest"
4,"Overall we enjoyed our Luxury Escapes 8-day holiday at this beautiful hotel, with its abundance of features well described in these reviews.  However as a 78 year old I personally felt challenged by the size of the location and especially with the many steps to negotiate (not many ramps). Breakfast at Salsa Verde Restaurant was particularly good.  Brian and Sandra Dale"

5,"It being a while since my last visit and the experience is the same ""fantastic""  They have one of the best bar in Bali, overlooking the sea in the day and a cool sea breeze in the evening. The air in August was cooling as it came from the Winter in Australia making the Sunny day not too hot."
5,Being a Diamond level member of Hyatt Gold Passport has its advantages however if ever I want a break away from the hustle and bustle of Bali and other hotel guests my first choice would be the Grand Club at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua....great for couples or families however a little limiting for a single if you are looking for more that relaxing by your private Grand Club pool and bar soaking up the sun watching the wildlife play among the trees.
4,"From the first moment I arrived at the hotel, I felt welcomed and pampered. The staff is unbelievably friendly and helped me out anytime. Food and drinks are great and I believe that there is something for everyone.  In regards to the Spa, the Mani/Pedi was relaxing and the quality was ok. I also had a hairbath and blowdry and this is something, where the staff needs to get trained - I had to tell her how to blowdry my hair.  Overall, I would come back here anytime!"
5,"It is the largest hotel in Nusa Dua. It differs from all the hotels green area and beautiful scenery. Attentive staff, neat rooms. The hotel is suitable for families, newlyweds and also for business events. There are all conditions for holding large events. The beautiful and wide beach."
5,Always satisfying  Always friendly Never a hassle If you are a five star traveler then this is definitely a real choice in Bali. two hundred characters are far too many for an old person that just says enough.

4,"Beautiful hotel. Great beach, swimming pools with kids slide, restaurants, rooms. The AC in the room is very good, something many Bali hotels struggle with. Only downside is that the hotel is huge so it can take a while to walk to your room."
5,"I love it to be stayed here! Really huge hotel, with a clean bathroom, big room, balcony but there is something you have to fix it. The lighting, i dont like the lighting! But anyway, Bali is everywhere with yellow lamp. They have big ground with a beautiful pond there. The pool was really amazing! And this hotel directly in front of the beach. If you stay there, you wouldnt mind to spend the whole day there. You will get everything you need. "
5,"Had a week off so we thought we would try a new area in Bali (Nusa Dua) and a new resort.  After paying top dollar for a resort we went to the Grand Hyatt I am glad to say that it was a good value for the dollar.  When you walk along the beach and compare, it is obvious that you are staying at the best. Beyond the great beach and stunning grounds/ pools and the massive spa ""complex"" (28 separate private spa villas...really?!) that my wife loved and the best gym that we have ever been to the real stand out here was the service.   Often one will go  to a place and ""put up"" with something sub standard but here they were able to achieve perfection (and we are finicky! :)  Everyone was always willing to go the distance to help and the standard of service for everything was excellent.…"
4,"My husband and I lived in Asia in the 1990's and once we discovered the Grand Hyatt in Bali, we were hooked. Years later, we found the property was still incredibly beautiful! People have commented that the rooms are dated; I am sorry to see that they are more Hyatt brand and less Balinese than they were so long ago. One of the things we like about this Hyatt is that it isn't a high rise hotel and the guests are spread out over a large area. We lazed by the pool and enjoyed people watching. I would strongly suggest the night market and Balinese dance show. It is a magical evening! Unfortunately we were there when there was a big festival in the nearby park and the ambiance was spoiled by the silly and very loud music, but that was certainly a random event."

4,"Beautiful hotel. Great beach, swimming pools with kids slide, restaurants, rooms. The AC in the room is very good, something many Bali hotels struggle with. Only downside is that the hotel is huge so it can take a while to walk to your room."
5,"I love it to be stayed here! Really huge hotel, with a clean bathroom, big room, balcony but there is something you have to fix it. The lighting, i dont like the lighting! But anyway, Bali is everywhere with yellow lamp. They have big ground with a beautiful pond there. The pool was really amazing! And this hotel directly in front of the beach. If you stay there, you wouldnt mind to spend the whole day there. You will get everything you need. "
5,"Had a week off so we thought we would try a new area in Bali (Nusa Dua) and a new resort.  After paying top dollar for a resort we went to the Grand Hyatt I am glad to say that it was a good value for the dollar.  When you walk along the beach and compare, it is obvious that you are staying at the best. Beyond the great beach and stunning grounds/ pools and the massive spa ""complex"" (28 separate private spa villas...really?!) that my wife loved and the best gym that we have ever been to the real stand out here was the service.   Often one will go  to a place and ""put up"" with something sub standard but here they were able to achieve perfection (and we are finicky! :)  Everyone was always willing to go the distance to help and the standard of service for everything was excellent.…"
4,"My husband and I lived in Asia in the 1990's and once we discovered the Grand Hyatt in Bali, we were hooked. Years later, we found the property was still incredibly beautiful! People have commented that the rooms are dated; I am sorry to see that they are more Hyatt brand and less Balinese than they were so long ago. One of the things we like about this Hyatt is that it isn't a high rise hotel and the guests are spread out over a large area. We lazed by the pool and enjoyed people watching. I would strongly suggest the night market and Balinese dance show. It is a magical evening! Unfortunately we were there when there was a big festival in the nearby park and the ambiance was spoiled by the silly and very loud music, but that was certainly a random event."
5,"Had the opportunity to stay at a lot of luxury brand hotels (including plenty of Hyatts) all around the world, but this one in paradise is unmatched. The weather and white sand beaches has a fair amount to do with it, but the hotel grounds' design and impressive dedication to ambiance is applause-worthy. Really, no other accommodation I've experienced has been quite so lovely. But I'll keep looking..."
4,"The Grand Hyatt reviews are extremely accurate so you will get exactly what people have writen here which is not always the case.  That being said we had an excellent time at the Hyatt.  First the negatives:  Yes the hotel is a bit dated, if you are looking for a sleek new and modern hotel then this is not the place.  The hotel grounds are immaculately maintained and beautiful.  The rooms show some signs of aging but nothing that drastically takes away from staying here.  Biggest complaint is the very limited selection of breakfast that many have mentioned.  Although we didn't experience any problems with crowding, bfast is offered in 3 restos, the selection is not on par with this type of hotel and if staying more than 3-5 days you will definitely become bored.  Only problem we…"
4,"Gardens, Staff and food were exceptional. Rooms that cater for more than 2 persons have a day bed as the second bed not an actual sleeping bed which was disappointing. Salsa Verde was the finest meals we have had whilst in Bali."
5,"First, I should preface this review with a bit about the area. Nusa Dua is lovely, with top notch hotels, nice beaches, and an almost sequestered feel. It's pleasant without being stuffy. If you're hunting for an area for an all night partying spot, try somewhere else. Maybe the Kuta area. Anyway, as first time visitors to Bali, my wife and I had no earthly idea what to expect. We were welcomed with an elegance and grace that was warm and charming. We were escorted to, and checked in at the Club desk, where all of the initial questions that we came up with were answered. They showed us to our room and gave us a map of the property. Normally I'd scoff at the map concept for a hotel, but I used it. A lot. That's how big this place is. The room was very large, with a spacious…"
5,"We stayed at this hotel recently with a ""package"" from Cudo,  The hotel was absolutely amazing if you like beach, lazy days etc. only close shopping was at boutique style complex, excellent for restuarants/ bars. More expensive than Bali markets and a drive away ($10-$15) but only if you ""need to go "".  Package was expensive and rather disappointing, food was ordinary and spa treatments out of this world but PRE-BOOK as I was told no appointments were available.  Staff were the usual friendly fall over you Balinese which is why you go right? Personal preference, but I do prefer the hills/off the beaten track but if 5 star is for you it is hard  to beat, if a little ""jaded"" around the edges they make you very welcome."

5,"We stayed for 9 nights at the Grand Hyatt during the Australian Sept school holidays.  The hotel overall was excellent, the pro's included: - beautiful established grounds - clean swimming pools, the waterslide was a hit with the kids and kept them busy for hours - white sandy beaches right along the front of the resort - great location, right next to Bali Collection, few minutes taxi from the main gate, right on the beach and walking distance to Bay Bali and many other hotels and small shopping strips - staff were great, very friendly - room was large, we had 2 adults and 2 children and the room was big enough, the day bed was nearly the size of a double bed and comfortably slept an adult and child together - breakfast was fresh, had a lot of variety and the kids loved the…"
4,"The Grand Hyatt is the perfect hotel for families visiting Bali. We had a great time and would recommend this hotel. Staff. The staff were courteous and friendly,as you would expect. Location, is convenient as you are twenty minutes from Kuta, and so you can enjoy the friendly quiet environment, and beautiful beach, but for $15 (private taxi) you could be at Kuta, which is very busy and noisy. The Hyatt boasts beautiful grounds, however some care around the pool is required due to poor maintenance. The food is great with a good variety of restaurants, you must do the Indonesian buffet which is brilliant, with the food cooked fresh in front of you. Breakfast is fine, with your typical options of eggs, pancakes cereals and fruit, cold meats, breads and pastry. The room is well…"
5,A fantastic stay. The staff were extremely friendly and helpfuland tremembered us by name and our likes etc. they like to make everyone feel special.  We have previously stayed in the club but on this occasion were on the 8 night vip package with inclusions. Our room was in a very good position close to pool and beach. We tried all the restaurants as we had vouchers and liked the garden cafe the best.  Cocktail in the persona lounge was ok but overpriced and was much smaller than previous. The grand Hyatt is in a good location and close to Bali collection and other restaurants. The beach is lovey with nice shady trees to sit under and is safe to swim having the protection of the reef . Great pools and good also for children with the waterslide.  Spa is expensive approx $120 fir…
5,"Frankly, I struggle between 4 and 5 stars rating for this property. Its old, but well maintained and generally offers good service. The location is also good at Nusa Dua and offers direct access to the beach. A lot of things to like, but again it feels old... Price is reasonable, so in the end I leaned toward 5 stars."
5,"We arrived late in the evening, we were told we would have a choice of rooms but when we arrived we didn't have a choice and had to move rooms two days into our holiday. This was a little annoying. The resort is beautiful, the gardens are exceptional and there could have been many people staying but because of the layout and selection of restaurants you never felt crowded. We had a few technical issues, the room shower blocked and flooded the floor for two days running and the toilet smelt bad in our adjoining room. The pools are well maintained, staff mostly attentive, food good, but drinks very expensive as are all the gift shops who are twice the price of the shops across the road at Bali Connection. My daughter and son I law said they wouldn't stay here, I would stay here…"

5,"Just by chance i was looking on scoopon and saw the Grand Hyatt had an offer for 8 nights, including 8 meals for 2ppl for $2000. What a bargain this turned out to be! By far the highlight of our 14 day trip to Bali. The meals within the Hotel were amazing, Salsa Verde (evening meals) were pretty basic but the other meals were fantastic. We have a one year old and found the pools to be perfect, plenty of shade and a water slide for the older kids. The grounds are immaculate and wildlife is abundant. There are plenty of food options outside the hotel and the Hyatt is home to the best beach in Nusa Dua. Would def return in the future. Grab yourself a steal if you're lucky enough to see the scoopon offered."
5,"Fantastic spacious resort with lots to explore. Amazing pools to keep the kids occupied. Beautiful lobby, bars and gardens. Kids club was not free. There were no free shows. Overall a great holiday destination."
3,"I stayed at the club room in this hotel for 5 days and just checked out (room 2249) on Oct. 6th.  I had stayed in grand hyatt Bali  3-4 times before and still liked overall setting.  Overall service was good, however, there were 2 things quite disappointing: 1). guest room WIFI did not work, so my wife and I had to use visitor WIFI log in for 5 days; 2). I requested for airport pick up and it was great with an executive Mercedes van.  I requested hotel car transfer to airport on Oct. 6th.  It was not cheap.  IDR 390K for a 20 minute ride and I was expecting the same van. First., it was charged twice on my bill.  I pointed out and it was corrected. However, when the car appeared,  it was a small tour van .  I called the grand club, and the lady who received the phone first said…"
4,"The Hyatt is on a great stretch of beach in Nusa Dua in the South. Unfortunately the location tends to be far from everywhere else, so if you are exploring the island - you may find yourself spending a lot of time in the car. The restaurants are all excellent - if a little pricy - particularly the pseudo market which serves up an amazing array of Balinese delicacies. The spa is an absolute treat."
5,"A tranquil resort with lots of shade, variety of pools and restaurants - just perfect for a family getaway. The waterslide was a hit with our children and kept them entertained for hours.  Staff were extremely friendly and made our stay so enjoyable. We will be back!"

4,Highly recommend this hotel for families looking for a relaxed holiday in Bali. The hotel is stylish and still child friendly.  The beach at Nusa Dua is probably one of the best and cleanest in Bali. Lovely setting and service. A resort you could easily return to.
5,"Setting in a large security heavy compound, this is typical Hyatt. Great rooms, beautiful gardens, ducks, squirrels, dragons and egrets. A secret green pool empty most days. Night markets, great spa. Everything available on site you can imagine. Rooms cleaned twice a day. 3 restaurants to choose for breakfast. The Bali Collection across the road with loads of speciality shops and a department store. The private beach and then the restaurants along the public beach. It's got it all!"
5,"What a lovely hotel! We splurged a bit on this hotel as we wanted the white beaches of Nusa Dua. We are a family of 4 (kids 7 and 9) and needed room for our children- our suite had a master bedroom, huge bathroom and other sofa bed which the staff prepared for my children. Every single person we encountered was friendly, helpful, and kind. The grounds of the hotel are truly spectacular and the pools just go on and on. While there were lots of kids there, I don't think it's great for toddlers as most of the pools are rather deep and the toddler pool is elevated and surrounded by concrete stairs. My older kids loved the slide.   The food is, predictably, expensive. We enjoyed going across the street to Bali Collection which has tons of stores, restaurants, etc for half the price. …"
4,"We loved our time in Bali, and we really enjoyed this hotel. The price is maybe a little bit high, but the facilities are great and the breakfast included was very very good. THe pool area is very busy all the time, and had to wait long at the pool restaurant, but the food was good, althoght a little expensive as compared to eating across the street at Balli Collection restaurants. The beach is wide and always very clean. The pool should open for longer hours, kids want to go even during evening time but it closed at 6pm."

This hotel is a standard 5-star hotel with fully condition such as spa, food service, gym, swimming pool,etc. Room was clean, fresh, royal style and no any hard smell like wet, rainy. Breakfast was standard, fully station. Overall, we had an awesome holiday here. For next time, I hope you can improve the service of each team member like english skill and hospitality."
4,The resort is huge and family friendly. The staff were very friendly and tolerant of younger children. The only down side is the breakfast wasn't that fantastic.  The pool is slightly old and needs better maintenance.   The room we had was on the North village and it was spacious.  There was a smaller day bed which was perfect for children or another adult.  The area is close to Bali Discovery which is a mall where you could get some daily supplies as well as some shopping done. We had a massage in that mall area and the service and price were reasonable.
4,"Stay at this hotel on the 10 till 14 september.Nice,big pool.Friendly staff.Food is great but a bit pricey.Just go to nearest shopping mall Bali Collection which has lot of restaurant.Waterblow is just nearby.Will come back again next year."
5,"Spent our vacation at the Grand Hyatt and were suitably pleased with our accommodation. We were in a club room, which was great. It was quiet and private am\nd the room was lovely. Balcony looking out over a pool and garden setting. The grounds are mature, beautiful and meticulously kept. The pools are lovely and the restaurants and food are very good. In the club lounge you have access to soft drinks and tea and coffee all day with a happy hour between 5-7 each day when they serve canapes and drinks. A lovely option. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Live music at some restaurants and Balinese shows at the Balinese restaurant. Well equipped gymnasium and spa area. Bikes for hire and multiple shops on the premises. A great option for a lovely holiday."
5,"Wonderful place to bring the children, especially because of the large pools and the water slide. We got it on a deal and were in the same room as the kids which was ok for this once but next time I would definitely get a separate room from the kids."

But, that didn't matter, I like my room, as just step outside is Balinese-featured pool (one of the Hotel's five pools); just like private pool (only shared with several other guests.) The room is spacious, clean, although the fitting is rather outdated.   The Bar. Salsa Bar is perfect place to enjoy the sunset. Located at the rooftop of   Salsa Verde restaurant.  The Pool. They have five different pools, and I think many guests enjoy Laggon pool (at the beachfront - with amazing view) and River Pool (surrounded by beautiful tropical garden).  The Restaurant. Garden Cafe and Salsa Verde, both serve breakfast (free), and I prefer Salsa…"
5,"We stayed art the Grand Hyatt for 8 nights last week (9 to 17 September).  The first night our room was very noisy so we requested a move and this was arranged the next day.  The room we then had was really quiet and the balcony had a view of the beach.  The Gardens here are truly magnificent , the staff very caring and friendly, the pools wonderful.  It is a bit away from the main part and hub of Bali ""Life"" but that suited me anyway. The surrounding areas were probably a bit more expensive than say other parts of Bali but our package had included a few meals, all breakfasts and 60 minute massages (very nice).  One of the meals in our package was at the Japanese Restaurant within the Resort and as a not so keen lover of Japanese food I was a bit apprehensive.  However, it…"

The hotel is quite old but well maintained and full of character with beautiful grounds and the staff are friendly and polite and willing to help with any small problem such as TV/dvd/safe problems in a timely manner.  It is in an excellent location being directly on a beautiful beach and directly opposite the Bali Collection. We only really had two complaints.....the first was that we specifically requested a quiet, private room away from children's playgrounds etc as we were an older couple travelling without family. We were allocated a room which looked out over the lagoon, but also looked into the club restaurant...not exactly private and we were woken several times a night and…"
5,Beautiful place for family holiday. Great location easy access to shop and restaurant near by and the Hotel staff were Professional and fantastic  also very good it's children.  The most cleanness  beach  Front  hotel in the area in Nusa Dua
5,"The Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua is the hotel to stay in if you wish to experience the best of Bali. Many of the staff have been here since it opened in 1991. They have matured, as the hotel has, very well. The grounds and pools are immaculate, aesthetically magnificent and spread over several acres. The beach must be one of the best and cleanest in the area. The rooms are more like suites which are lovingly serviced daily.The lobby is world class, spacious and peaceful with appropriate Indonesian music and entertainment nightly in the purpose built dining /entertainment amphitheatre area. Here they have a buffet of Asian and international food with something for the lovers of suckling pig, seafood to vegetarian.Cuisine is international and the head of Food and Beverage - Mark could…"

We were allocated a room which looked out over the lagoon, but also looked into the club restaurant...not exactly private and we were woken several times a night and…"
5,Beautiful place for family holiday. Great location easy access to shop and restaurant near by and the Hotel staff were Professional and fantastic  also very good it's children.  The most cleanness  beach  Front  hotel in the area in Nusa Dua
5,"The Grand Hyatt, Nusa Dua is the hotel to stay in if you wish to experience the best of Bali. Many of the staff have been here since it opened in 1991. They have matured, as the hotel has, very well. The grounds and pools are immaculate, aesthetically magnificent and spread over several acres. The beach must be one of the best and cleanest in the area. The rooms are more like suites which are lovingly serviced daily.The lobby is world class, spacious and peaceful with appropriate Indonesian music and entertainment nightly in the purpose built dining /entertainment amphitheatre area. Here they have a buffet of Asian and international food with something for the lovers of suckling pig, seafood to vegetarian.Cuisine is international and the head of Food and Beverage - Mark could…"
1,"Have just visited Grand Hyatt with family as part of Luxury Escape deal. We were always qualified as ""luxury escape"" customers by front desk first and felt like the service offered was in accordance with the Luxury Escape ""specifications""...we really felt being treated as ""second grade"" citizens...nothing Luxurious about it really, quite opposite as a matter of fact.I am sure that our experience would be a different one, had we not booked with Luxury Escape but would never visit this place again nor would I recommended it to any friends or family!! "
4,"Fantastic Hotel with outstanding service most of the time. Rooms are becoming a little dated though but spacious with good air conditioning. Great swimming pool along side the best beach in Nusa Dua, quiet, relaxing and also fun if you want it to be."
4,"The hotel is surrounded by many beautiful tree, plants and flower.  The room is big and clean.  There are only 5 mins walk to the only big Shopping Centre~Bali Collection which is many shops, resturants and supermarket. The staffs are also nice and helpful."
5,"Had a fantastic family stay here. The location is quite breath-taking, direct access to the beach, and fantastic staff who are more than happy to asset with any request. Great hotel for families with plenty of child related activities to keep all members of the family happy."
3,"We have stayed at the Hyatt in many countries, as it is our preferred hotel due to the 5 star rooms and facilities. We were very disappointed with our room at the Grand Hyatt Bali, it was quite out dated and rundown. The wood decking on our balcony was old and uneven ( safety issue ). The pool was in need of repair and there were numerous broken tiles which is a safety problem for children due to the sharp edges.  The grounds were beautiful and all the staff were outstanding. However, the room, pool and breakfast buffet were disappointing and not up to the standard of a 5 star hotel or other Hyatt hotels around the world."

3,"Spent 2 weeks at this resort. Weather was perfect.   Our Pros:  * Amazing and accommodating  staff members * Beautiful property that was well maintained * Very secured and safe property and grounds with guards at every check point * Beach was gorgeous and not crowded - many pool/beach chairs available * Great breakfast buffet on the resort with many restaurant options nearby * Gym was clean with private pool, hot tub, cold water plunge, sauna & steam room * FANTASTIC trails & sidewalks for runners & walkers on/off the property and along the beach. Resort offered bikes for all ages for US $5  Very few Cons:  * Although the resort was clean and well kept (even the exterior pool bathrooms were well maintained), little attention was given to a few things in our room that were…"
5,"A most relaxing holiday in a beautiful setting. The staff were great an food awesome. Will return again., just not when a  big Military Conference is also there. Overall we were  very pleased with our stay and it was the staff that made it so  much fun."
5,"Our room was situated on the 4th floor overlooking a lagoon pool, gorgeous gardens and the white sands of Nusa Dua Beach.  The room was beautifully set-up with a massive bed, double basins to the bathroom with a separate area for the shower and bath, as well as a separate toilet.  The balcony was generous - we loved sitting out there watching the waves crash onto the beach.  The resort has beautifully manicured gardens and koi ponds everywhere.  All the restaurants offer great food - we especially liked the Japanese Restaurant, having never eaten Japanese before.  The Grand Hyatt is situated on a very large parcel of land and may not be suitable for people with walking problems.  The shopping arcade has everything you need - but Bali Collection is just across the road.  The…"
5,"Hotel located by the beach, has trees on the beach as well where you lay down on sands and enjoy watching perfect view and you can even feed friendly squarels. Hotel was designed with Asian style and it  has one of the best gardens that you can ever see. Food is very delicious and of course perfect Balinese hopitality.  Just make sure that if you like enjoy the ocean you gotta go to beach before 15:00 (03:00 PM) since the water tides nearly 200 meters and you can not swim.  Definitely you will enjoy every minute. "
5,"Great hotel, enjoyed my room which had a pond filled with koi fish running by my patio. I would have coffee and feed the fish. Amazing white sand beaches with crystal clear water. Hotel has different restaurants which are over priced, but the food is good. Eating in the city is the way to go. There is Bali collections three minutes away from the hotel. Customer service was amazing. Will definitely be visiting again."

The place speaks for itself. I will be coming back here. The staff, surrounds of the resort and service were fantastic. It is a 2 minutes stroll to Bali Collection shops and restaurants which is convenient when you don't want to leave the resort burned you do, you are still within  secure grounds of a gated area where all the other resorts are located.

1,"If you are after a theme park pretend Bali, this's the place. After deciding to submit a review, I read the most recent reviews and saw complaints about frogs being too noisy, so there you have it.  We booked for 8 nights, and after only two, decided to cut and run, as far as possible, despite no refunds. If you are after disneylandesque resort, then you are in for a treat. Even the food was dumbed down to suit freaked out westerners who should've stayed home.  Admittedly, all our mistake - we were seduced by a 'Luxury Escapes' package that was too good to be true, and it was !"
5,"Perfect place for a relaxing holiday. Magnificent facility, very friendly helpful staff. Great choice of restaurants and food. Wonderful pools, family friendly. The hotel and grounds are beautiful. I mis placed my bag on arrival. Rudi was very attentive and after security review found my bag. Very professional."
5,"A wonderful place to lay back and recharge.  Stayed in room 3224 on the extreme end of the South wing - an ideal location.  Great pool and surrounds.  Fabulous service from all staff.  Facilities were first rate - the fitness center, kids club, pools and water slide.  Nampu Japenese and Pasar Senggol Indonesian restaurants were high quality.  Food and drink expensive though"
3,We stayed at the Club Rooms but frogs are so noisy at night. Room and bathroom is so spacious. Bath amenties are not in the luxury segment. Our minibar does not frost and nobody fixed it. Service is not like in Grand Hyatt brand standarts. Staff must be educate.There is no individual service feel. Hotel rooms are old furnished and needs a complete renovation. Pools and flora is so nice and Lobby are is wel decorated better than Four Season's Bali. Hotel's garden is like a heaven. Beach is so wide but security is so weak on the beach side. Bike rental and Spa is gorgeous. You must rent a bike and tour around the Nusa Dua. Front of the hotel there is a big open air shopping mall Bali Collection. You can find everyhing at there. Hotel is so big there must be more shuttle services…

Good hotel for family stay as well, as offers things for children. Has very good restaurants (Italian and Japanese) worth having dinner at."

4,"A good hotel for a vacation and enjoy the beauty of Bali. Unfortunately, I didn't find any seafood menu for breakfast. The swimming pool has unique shape and located on the beach with white sand. The room is quite far from the lobby hotel. For those who love shopping, you can visit several stores around the hotel or take a walk 5 minutes to Bali Collection."

5,"The Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua is a large resort with more than 600 rooms, 4+ pools (including 2 with water slides!), a number of restaurants and bars, and a very family friendly atmosphere. We stayed for 10 nights in September 2015 and had a great time.  The staff are very friendly and helpful, and many staff went out of their way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Pretty much all of the staff speak English so you won't order a drink and instead receive a hovercraft full of eels :-)  The rooms are spacious with the king bed being the size of 2 queen sized beds joined together.

4,Hotel staff are courteous with Bi-Lingual reception. Room are not the typical floor by floor but its a villa type. Good food and nice ambiance. Restaurant is located near the beach with an awesome view. Hotel is located at Nusa Dua and its a compound of hotel and shopping area.
4,"The resort looks stunning, the gardens are manicured and immaculate. The rooms are a little dated, but fine. This is a large resort with 650 rooms.

The pools were lovely and relaxing and the kids loved the water slide.  The kids club was expensive and disappointing, we were going to leave our kids there but decided against it as the kids club area was sad looking, with two ladies on staff, but very few kids actually using the facility.

Rooms are comfy - if the bed a touch too hard, but that is personal preference. There is a choice of pools, it would be good if there was at least one pool which is adult only so you can relax without kids splashing and maybe have children allowed in all the other pools. It would also be nice to have those areas smoke free.

There's a shopping mall within the resort where you can buy clothes, jewellery, homewares, Bali souvenirs, snack food and drinks, a money changer, ATM, a world class spa, fitness centre and even Bali street type food along with Balinese cultural dances.  It really has everything.  If thats not enough, the Bali Collection shopping centre is within walking distance.  The staff will do anything to ensure that you enjoy your stay."
5,"Beautiful resort, the grounds are absolutely stunning, with ponds and lakes teeming with fish, birds (large and small) everywhere and even 3 monitor lizards in residence and I particularly loved the cute little squirrels in the trees, even the ones who tried to share my lunch by the Grand Club pool one afternoon.  Only criticism, the two sofas in our Grand Club suite were very uncomfortable (one quite narrow and as hard as a rock, the other very wide so needed several pillows propped behind my back, it was hard too, but strangely also saggy in the middle).  Other than that the suite was lovely and huge.  Great to have a second separate toilet/powder room too.  Bathroom was massive but didn't give much privacy having open sections in the walls so you could see from and into the…"

Oh my God there is noway on earth that any one can find a hotel better than this in these range. We requested for two connecting room and they have upgraded our rooms to an unbelievable luxury suite connected to a normal room. Waoooo the rooms were so clean and decorated so great and every day they make it fresh with lots of water and fruits. The rooms were smell like flower. There were every thing nespreso machine and so many other. Bath tub shower and loo was so spacious and clean and new decorated. Staffs were really good. They really tried to help you from their hearts with really nice behavior warm smile and good English…

5,"me and my family, inc my children stayed at the grand hyatt nus adua bali from the 4th of sept- 13th of sept 2015. we all can not fault on anything. it was fantastic and I recommend anyone planning on staying in nusa dua to stay at this hotel. we are from Australia so the pool, food, sleeping arrangements suited us well. the best hotel we have stayed in in bali hands down. the salsa verde restaurant was brilliant, wood fired pizza with a sun set view. go see a guy named Eky, typical Balinese service and commitment to his job. loved the place. will be returning there for sure. enjoy"
4,"From the moment we arrived we fell in love with the hotel and we love Bali as this was our third visit to the island.  The staff were helpful and friendly, and we had a lovely ocean view room, which was huge and overlooked the fish pond, garden, beach and sea.  I have to say we were glad we had an ocean view room, rather than one in the gardens as i would have felt a little hemmed in as the area appeared quite shady and dark at times.   That said our bed was huge and very comfortable, and we couldn't fault the facilities in our room.  We used to love to sit on our balcony and watch the wildlife in the gardens below, including the water monitors who 'live' in the hotel grounds.  We stayed on a B&B basis and we had our breakfast down near the beach as you could sit outside.  We…"
4,"Walking to the open lobby was amazing to see the sea and the well maintained grounds. The rooms themselves are a bit old and dated. The bathroom door doesn't close anymore as the wood has expanded too much, the pool is literally falling apart with light fixtures floating off its mount, the water in the pool was murky and had an oily sheen on the surface. The place is massive and took a while to get to lobby and restaruants. One day my key stopped working and it would have been 5min walk to lobby but luckily housekeeping was around to open the door for me. The food was average except the Italian restaurant by the pool which was excellent. The service throughout the excellent and made up for the outdated facilities. Free Wifi throughout the site was great."
3,"My first room was dark, smelly and certainly not used frequently Even the phone was smelly! I have been changed for one with a view on the sea. Better but many little things were not working and it was really cold. I couldn't fix the air con with temperature, so I slept with more blankets!Very noisy also.like the bed! The breakfast was poor ( difficult to get butter).  The pool is more a children playground that a real pool and not so clean.  The best and beautiful thing is the beach, if you go there, you'd better sleep on the beach...And the staff (except the reception) was really very nice."
1,"I don't usually write reviews but this place was terrible and not cheap, the breakfast was the same and boring everyday, the plates were not cleaned, maybe they need a better dishwasher, the shower in the room  changed from boiling hot to cold all the time and would not hold a constant temperature and to top it off on our last night there I was awoken by a generator or loud engine outside my room at 4:30am! The place is far too expensive for what we received. There are much better options in the area. The staff was friendly, wifi was good everywhere, and the grounds were beautiful "

4,"From the moment we arrived we fell in love with the hotel and we love Bali as this was our third visit to the island.  The staff were helpful and friendly, and we had a lovely ocean view room, which was huge and overlooked the fish pond, garden, beach and sea.  I have to say we were glad we had an ocean view room, rather than one in the gardens as i would have felt a little hemmed in as the area appeared quite shady and dark at times.   That said our bed was huge and very comfortable, and we couldn't fault the facilities in our room.  We used to love to sit on our balcony and watch the wildlife in the gardens below, including the water monitors who 'live' in the hotel grounds.  We stayed on a B&B basis and we had our breakfast down near the beach as you could sit outside.  We…"
4,"Walking to the open lobby was amazing to see the sea and the well maintained grounds. The rooms themselves are a bit old and dated. The bathroom door doesn't close anymore as the wood has expanded too much, the pool is literally falling apart with light fixtures floating off its mount, the water in the pool was murky and had an oily sheen on the surface. The place is massive and took a while to get to lobby and restaruants. One day my key stopped working and it would have been 5min walk to lobby but luckily housekeeping was around to open the door for me. The food was average except the Italian restaurant by the pool which was excellent. The service throughout the excellent and made up for the outdated facilities. Free Wifi throughout the site was great."
3,"My first room was dark, smelly and certainly not used frequently Even the phone was smelly! I have been changed for one with a view on the sea. Better but many little things were not working and it was really cold. I couldn't fix the air con with temperature, so I slept with more blankets!Very noisy also.like the bed! The breakfast was poor ( difficult to get butter).  The pool is more a children playground that a real pool and not so clean.  The best and beautiful thing is the beach, if you go there, you'd better sleep on the beach...And the staff (except the reception) was really very nice."
1,"I don't usually write reviews but this place was terrible and not cheap, the breakfast was the same and boring everyday, the plates were not cleaned, maybe they need a better dishwasher, the shower in the room  changed from boiling hot to cold all the time and would not hold a constant temperature and to top it off on our last night there I was awoken by a generator or loud engine outside my room at 4:30am! The place is far too expensive for what we received. There are much better options in the area. The staff was friendly, wifi was good everywhere, and the grounds were beautiful "
5,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali in Nusa Dua in September. I personally believe its the best time to visit Bali. We booked through Luxury Escape, a package deal for 8 nights included 3 dinners, one lunch, various spa treatments and included airport transfers. The hotel grounds are enormous and we got lost a couple of times in the first two days. The hotel is next to a white sandy beach with plenty of beach lounges and umbrellas. All grounds are kept in pristine condition and we enjoyed a variety of wildlife from our room which was ground floor with lagoon views. Every morning fish and a variety of birds would come to be fed, including a massive sized lizard. Rooms are spacious, bed very comfortable and pillows offered soft or firm depending on your preference. The room was…"
5,"We went to the Grand Hyatt, Bali, on a Luxury Escapes package. But we were never treated like we were on a package -- everything was as if we were ordinary hotel guests paying item by item, event by event. Overall - very simple -- superb hotel, well maintained, wonderful value package."
5,"We loved our stay at Grand Hyatt, very impressive front foyer with great service and spectacular outlook, room was spacious and very clean, room was exceptionally comfortable. Bottled water was provided twice daily. Pools were all fabulous, especially the popular pool with kids water slide. all staff were outstanding, so polite, friendly and helpful. Food was a suprising hit, buffet breakfast was impressive, food for every taste, even gluten free options for me! Each restaurant was faultless, Japanese was fantastic! We used in-house babysitting service my 2 children ( 8 ,10yrs)  LOVED Putu. We travelled with the luxury escape deal and every inclusion was well worth the $. Kirya spa is a hidden gem, very very impressive! The beach was fantastic, great for a morning walk to the…"
5,"My two children are aged under 5 and as hard as it can be travelling with children sometimes, Grand Hyatt Bali made the experience so enjoyable and comfortable.  We can't wait to visit again!!!  Beautiful landscaping, friendly staff willing to help with anything! Thank you!"
4,"We had a lovely stay at the Grand  Hyatt Nusa Dua a bit pricey under normal circumstances but great value with luxury escapes rooms very large and comfortable, restaurants great, staff great, hotel needs a bit of a refurbishment, would definitely stay here again, very relaxing,"

5,The best Bali holiday we have had by far. This resort out did all others and is right on the shores of white sands of a private beach. Would recommend this highly to anyone heading to Bali for their next holiday.
5,"We have a club room overlooking the Ocean and secluded club pool.  It's quiet with a beautiful outlook over the balcony.  the rooms are beautifully appointed and comfortable.  The resort has 4 different themed restaurants and the food has been excellent with one exception, would not recommend the room service food.   The staff at the hotel are very pleasant and accommodating and the service has been outstanding.  We would happily recommend the Grand Hyatt Hotel to couples and family groups for a luxury, relaxing Holliday."
3,"Except the toilet condition is not clean and good enough. Rest of the hardware and software are good enough. On the other hand, the transportation arrangement by 'Blue Taxi' is not good enough and some taxi driver play a trick on the route and sales something to you!"
5,"We purchased the 10 day Scoopon deal and it was the best purchase decision we ever made.   Check-in: The second we arrived, we were greeted with cold towels a delicious mocktail. Check in was smooth and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The view is breathtakingly beautiful from reception.   The room: We had the Grand Room in the North Building that looked over the lagoon. The room was large and clean, plenty of room for the baby cot. The day bed was the size of a double bed and was very comfortable to sleep on. The bathroom was clean and had a walk in closet and separate toilet. The rooms were made everyday with new towels and pillow cases and tidied the room up which you appreciate when you have a messy toddler.   Food/Restaurants: We alternated most mornings with…"
3,"I have always had very positive experiences at Hyatt's around the world and I have very mixed feelings about my time here.  I was upgraded to an ocean view room which was a nice gesture upon arrival that I most appreciated. I had taken a brutal series of connecting flights to get here and was looking for a refreshing experience. The rooms are missing the fine attention to detail I have come to expect from fine Hyatt properties. Small things such as a a bit of peeling paint, broken sink drain and dull shaving razors are small annoyances but take away from the overall image of the property. Around 1pm, I called concierge to ask a few questions and they failed to pick up.   Despite these shortcomings, I requested to extend my visit one day using my Gold Passport points. I was…"

5,A most beautiful hotel with wonderful staff.Views and grounds are just exquisite..We had a Luxury escapes package and nothing was too much trouble.Our meals were all beautiful.Just a short stroll to Bali Collection. The grounds are just magnificent and beautiful pools to swim in.Just a marvelous place to chill and be pampered. Would stay again anytime.
5,"My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We loved it! Not only were the hotel and grounds beautiful, our room was lovely and large with a view of the paradise Emerald pool.  While the pools were plentiful and nice, we spent a lot of our time under the shady trees on the beach - we felt like we were actors in a Corona commercial.  The pool staff even served us at our comfortable beach lounges so we were able to rest in a tranquil atmosphere.  We have stayed in many beautiful resorts; however, this one has the best staff. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel like celebrities!  Our favorite restaurant, The Garden Cafe, wasn't even on the water.  We loved it because the staff was soooo nice.  I have food allergies and the first time we showed…"
5,"Fabulous hotel; great location in Nusa Dua, with a beautiful beach front, multiple restaurants and cafés, bike riding, gym, walks and magnificent gardens. Room was large with large bathroom including bath. Aircon was effective and quiet; outlook from a small balcony was onto a peacefull and pretty setting of lagoon and gardens;We stayed one week and had the most relaxing time. Staff were friendly and helpful. We picked up a good deal for two through Luxury Escapes (Australia) which included several lunches and evening meals, as well as some spas, massages and all breakfasts. We also hired a local driver for 3 of the days to tour various parts of Bali ( at $50-60 per day for car and driver). Would be happy to stay again and probably will."
5,"It is a remarkable place. With lust of ponds that full of lotus and other tropical trees, you'll find yourself in peacefull mind and soul. The scenery is unbeatable with a lot of 'live' things. You'll easily find swans, birds, and squirel around you. Last but not least, the beach is in front of your sight. You probably not find any mistake here. Everything goes well here."
5,"This hotel had it all! The restaurants were magnificent as were the grounds and numerous pools. It had its own shops, night market and plenty of activities. The spa was like heaven on earth for the wife. The short walk to the Bali collection was handy too. Overall such a great experience."

5,"We would thoroughly recommend the Grand Hyatt to anybody considering a stay in this area, and an upgrade to the grand club should be considered. The staff are very friendly and courteous, without being intrusive. The hotel is clean and secure."
5,"Great resort, beatiful garden, outstanding rooms, excellent room service. Altogether one of the nicest resorts in an excellent price-quality relation in Bali. The restaurants are good, but not outstanding. The beach could be better kept, some of the showers did not work and the beach was not always clean. The pools are great, also for children, though it never gets very loud."
3,"Staff were nice and friendly, but need some improvements for facilities. We found lots of ants especially on beds... after some treatments by staff, it was ok, thou. My son enjoyed water slider very much but water of swimming pool seemed not clear enough to swim.  Kids club seems for younger child like under 4 years."
5,"Of all hotels we stayed in in Bali, THIS one takes the cake - as far as our kids are concerned. One word - SLIDE. Kids preference aside, we loved the relaxed feel, plenty of spots around various pools, proximity to Bali Collection and many other small things that added to a fantastic holiday. In fact, we stayed at other 5* hotels in Nusa Dua, but this one will, unanimously will be on our list next time we pop in to Bali!"
5,This is the second time we've stayed here within a year and it just excels itself.. From the food to the staff just superb! The Kriya Spa is world class and has to be experienced.. The staff are what make this hotel..They Will do anything for you- nothing is to much.. Pool area with water slide is fantastic as are the other pools.. My only gripe- needs more umbrellas around the pool areas because they are taken very early..

4,"The hotel has a large property and the gardens and beach front area is fantastic . Rooms are spacious but a little dated in the decor. Staff are friendly and helpful. The food is a little disappointing as we only like the chicken and the pork, beef and lamb are not up to par. There should be an introductoy session after check in so the guests can know what is being offered at the hotel, we find out slowly about what this vast property offers. The car service with chaffeur is good and at reasonable rates and one should hire a car to spend a day in Ubud."
5,"We love, love, loved this hotel! The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. The grounds were immaculately kept and tranquil and large enough to allow me time to escape the family for a while and have some peace time. Breakfast venue was stunning and food was fabulous. Kids adored the pools and water slide. The salsa bar was so beautiful for a drink at sunset. In short, a fabulous, relaxing place for a family holiday"
5,I was the event organiser for over 80 delegates. I found the Grand Hyatt to be professional in all dealings with the group. There were no issues with any last minute changes and all our needs were met. I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua as a fantastic venue to hold a conference and will have no hesitation in recommending it.
5,Really enjoyed another stay at Grand Hyatt Bali. Everything from airport pickup to airport dropoff worked like clockwork. Front desk staff were great and Ocean King room (suite) was very well appointed and comfortable. Had all amenities on hand and some nice extras. Really great balcony to soak up the Bali surf. Enjoyed the Lobby Bar and Gardencourt Restaurant. Order carefully so you don't eat too much delicious Indonesian food!
5,It was my first time and excellent stay. The place was excellent and breath-takingly beautiful. I stayed for business matters and I slept peacefully. I had the Club Garden privilege. All the staff were nice and delicious food.

If your with the family and friend the prefect place. Please make sure you call in and check if there any corporate booking, else the hotel is extremely busy.."
5,We stayed there for a week with the family. Nice property and great swimming pool. Direct access to the beach which was very convenient. Staff was very friendly and always available to help. Room was big enough and well equipped. We really enjoyed the place.
4,"If I am not wrong, this is at Grand Hyatt, Bali! Great hi-class ambience. Been there twice whilst our stay at the Grand Hyatt hotel. Loved it!"
5,"Aahh! My stay was simply awesome at Grand Hyatt, Bali! The entrance itself is enthralling, its like the beach has its arms right open, engulfing the hotel. Very good fine-dining restaurants, we have tried 4 of them. The hotel has a nice day care arrangement for the kids too. There were small stalls set up by the local craftsworkers, from them we managed to buy few very good pieces if wood work and craftsmanship!All in all, this place is superb!"
5,"This is a must stay place in Nusa Dua.  Huge property with lush green lawns and water bodies spread out all over the hotel.  Easy access to the beach and large number of lounging beach beds/chairs make it very comfortable to relax.  Check in on the 10th for 3 nights.  Efficient staff at the front desk who quickly obliged to our request for inter connecting rooms.  Had to wait for a while as this was a last minute request but were made very comfortable during the waiting period.  After an initial hiccup on the first night with the air conditioning not working fine, it was smooth sailing all the way.  Having said that, the maintenance guys were over to have a look in-spite of the fact that it was almost 3 am!!!!!   Extremely friendly and attentive staff.  Delicious foods.  Good…"

5,"My husband and I travelled to Bali for the first time from Hong Kong in July 2015. Having stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Singapore previously, we chose Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua with the comfort of knowing the quality of the hotel would be excellent.   We weren't disappointed. We arranged an airport transfer through the e-concerige which was extremely easy and were met with a cold towel at the airport and driven to our hotel. Our check in was extremely early in the morning (2am), nevertheless the service was outstanding. We were checked into a room close to the Club Area of the hotel, on the 4th floor and it is highly recommended to request such a room. Close enough to reception and restaurant, but far enough away from the pool that you still had peace and quiet. Our room overlooked a…"
5,This is a great place to be. You can spend all your time inside the resort and you may forget that there were attractions to be visited that were originally on your list. I think close to perfect for a family vacation.
5,"We went for 6 days holiday in Grand Hyatt last week. We are glad we choose GH instead of other resort in Nusa Dua. Despite the fact the building itself is 24 years old, the service is outstanding. We had hiccups on arrival and tackled immediately by Mr. Agus (FOM). Haris from Guest Relation was brilliant. There are 3 restaurant for bfast we tried but the best is Garden, the staff remember us and greet us with sincere heart :) resort is so green and refreshing. There are more than 1 pool you can use but our fav is balinese pool. The Housekeeping did a great job during our stay by always servicing our room on time and giving us extra water (without being asked) because we have baby with us. My husband and I already thinking to come back again even before we check out :) :) the…"
5,"Stayed in the Grand Club area of the hotel. The room was excellent - very spacious with a great bathroom and living area. The Grand Club area also has its own pool area. The main pool is where the families with kids will typically be. If you are traveling by yourself for some personal time, or as a couple, or with a group of adults, you will want to be in the Grand Club area of the hotel. The grounds of the hotel are very well maintained and beautiful both day and night. My particular room had the benefit of a balcony that was shaded from the sun in the afternoon. This was great after a day on the beach or by the pool to relax on the balcony out of the direct sunlight.  The main breakfast area was great with some changes to the menu each day while always having the basics (eggs…"
5,"Beautiful grounds with squirrels, dragons, egrets, ducks and large gold fish - goy I think. Rooms where typical Hyatt and cleaned twice daily. Everything from 3 restaurants to choose from for a amazing buffet breakfast to great spa.Bali collection across the road with loads of speciality shops and a department store. A private beach with the public beach walk and choices of restaurants. It's got it all in this security drenched compound."

The grounds of the hotel are very well maintained and beautiful both day and night. My particular room had the benefit of a balcony that was shaded from the sun in the afternoon. This was great after a day on the beach or by the pool to relax on the balcony out of the direct sunlight.  The main breakfast area was great with some changes to the menu each day while always having the basics (eggs…"
5,"Beautiful grounds with squirrels, dragons, egrets, ducks and large gold fish - goy I think. Rooms where typical Hyatt and cleaned twice daily. Everything from 3 restaurants to choose from for a amazing buffet breakfast to great spa.Bali collection across the road with loads of speciality shops and a department store. A private beach with the public beach walk and choices of restaurants. It's got it all in this security drenched compound."
5,"We booked a luxury escape package for 8 nights and thought we might have been treated differently, but it was the opposite. We were greeted with so many vouchers including dinners, massages, lunch, pedicures etc..... All the staff are exceptional but special mention to Roro in the garden cafe she has the most amazing out look on life and loves her job and her customers. The restaurants are lovely but expensive (the 21% tax and service charge hurts the wallet) we went across the road to Bali collections for dinner a couple of nights. We would go back but only on a package."
5,Lovely peaceful and romantic hotel in Bali. My husband and I came here for our honeymoon and I would definately recommend staying here! Everything about the holiday was just perfect with scenes and weather wonderful.
5,always enjoy coming back to Grand Hyatt Nusadua. new and younger staffs with lack of courtesy and experiences were a little be annoying.Management needs to monitor closely how they work. will not stop me to come back for more.
3,"This is a great property for Honey mooners. the international foods is good but nothing for the Indian palate. big rooms. a shopping market is next to the hotel and is great place to visit in the evening.  the hotel is far away the tourist place of Bali, Saminiyak and Kuta. there was a problem with the hotel staff as it was asking to pay us after every thing we used, even after 300$ security deposit. this was really bad. we even got a apology letter from the hotel and after shouting in the reception area about the inconvenience we faced."
4,"I have read reviews from this hotel in regards of being a little worn out, which was my impression as well. I agree that this hotel is great, but falls short of being a luxury resort. My family and I had a great time, but we seem to agree that the resort needs a renewal touch. I have stayed in many Grand Hyatt and this one falls short of expectations. Good but not great is definitely how I describe my experience."

5,"Fantastic hotel all round. Wonderful welcome. Comfortable beds, amazing gardens, pools and beach. Food was good all round the restaurants and bars. We stayed as a club member but not sure if it was worth the extra money. Staff were so helpful. If it were local I would go there every year."
5,"Grand Hyatt Bali is the crown jewel of resorts in Nusa Dua, with 636 luxury rooms and suites nested in low-rise Balinese villas, located in 4 villages across its huge compound. Here, a world of exotic pampering, exquisite dining and authentic fascinating Balinese culture awaits you. The Kriya spa is a must-visit! Photos and detailed review of my stay on my blog http://floraisabelle.com/grand-hyatt-bali/"
3,"Being a loyal Hyatt member, I had high expectation for this hotel. But unfortunately, they did not deliver compared to other Hyatt locations. I stayed there with my wife for 6 nights, but wish we had stayed somewhere else. I will compare them to their counterpart, Hyatt Yogyakarta which is also in Indonesia.   Cons:  -It seems like they cater more to tour groups vs individual bookings -Does not provide free shuttle to Kuta, compared to Hyatt Yogyakarta, which provided free shuttle to town. It is remotely located, so it will cost $$ to go anywhere.  -Stayed there for 6 nights, and they did not want to replenish fruit basket:( -Room for improvement on customer service -Breakfast is average.  Pro: -Beautiful property and room well kept.  -Justin the service manager is exceptional.…"
3,"The service of Hyatt Bali was poor and very slow response with the feedback. We tried 4 hotels in Bali, I thought it was the worst one. First day we went into the room, cigarette butts have been found in the bathroom, the next day plug the toilet for long time, no one fix it. I don't think it was an Hyatt!!"
5,"Amazing hotel, a Landscapers dream. I have never stayed at a better hotel and i,ve stayed at over 200 in the past 40 years. Being a Landscaper by trade i was amazed at the quality of the grounds and the deditication  the staff."

5,Stayed at this great hotel once again with my family.  We have always find his resort very enchanting. The main pool is one of the best we have come across for a resort and the sandy white beach is simply beautiful.  The landscape of this resort is fabulous with shady trees at the right spots. The staff were friendly and always greeted us with genuine smiles on their faces. We ate at Salsa Verde and we really like the Beef Rendang Pizzas. The grounds of this resort is very spacious.  We highly recommend this resort!
3,Overall a good experience as one might expect from Hyatt.  Great location good beach and resort was safe clean and friendly environment.   Traffic out of the hotel is quite bad so we are confined to the hotel vicinity
4,"We visited Bali and stayed in this Beautiful Hotel. Rooms are Modern Spacious and well done. Restaurant Serves good food. Hotel has a Picture Perfect Beach and a beautiful Pool. Staff is good and eager to serve. The Hotel also has a beautiful Spa  Also, I preferred staying in Quite Nusa Dua instead of Vibrant and Loud Seminyak. Also, because Bali is essentially safe, one can always go out and Party in the evenings.  However, we faced a very careless Front Desk. Our rooms were paid in advance. On top of it, we had paid $300 as security when requested without any question. The Front Desk However, put a ""No Credit"" remark on our Rooms. This resulted in us having to pay for everything we used. In fact on one occasion after a swim in Pool, staff followed me to the room for taking the…"
5,"Staff at Grand Hyatt in Bali the best!!!! couldn't help us enough would recommend any one to stay. Beautiful gardens, pools and food the best.so many places to eat.Shopping center just across road.And the massages they have magic hands.would go back again for shore"
5,"We had 12 nights in a large spacious room. 5 restuarants and numerous swimming pools and close to excellent shopping centre provide plenty to do. The tropical gardens are great. The staff were excellent, very helpful."

Maybe the only…"
3,"We ended our week in Bali by spending two last nights in Nusa Dua. We booked the room on the previous day, but the rate was still very good for a 5-star hotel. The room was nice and clean, just like the whole resort area in general. However, expect to pay around double or triple price for food and drinks in comparison to regular Bali prices.  The beach was very disappointing, because the sea level was so low that it took long to walk until the water was above the knee. Long before that, the soft sand below feet had already changed to spikey stones. After one try at the beach, we decided to stay at the pool area which was very nice. Maybe the water temperature could have been a bit more refreshing though."
5,"Just returned from an amazing stay in Bali staying at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua  Fantastic service, beautiful gardens, pool area huge and plenty of room around the pool area. Staff very friendly and genuinely tried to make our stay as memorable as they could."
2,"I am being a little harsh here, but I expected better from a 5 star hotel. It just seemed to me that the attitude of get as much money as you can out of the foreigner was rife here. It was only little things, like the assumption and pushing of highly priced transport as opposed to taxi's when ordering via the counter - the fact that it always took 10 minutes for a taxi to arrive (despite a whom heap sitting out the front of the complex (no kickbacks there I bet)....  The information centre that wanted to charge an extra $150 to organise a vist to Bali Safari and Marine park - ended up doing that online.... the fact that the workers could tell us how to get to restaurant next door (Pirate Bay), but were happy to point us to the extremely high cost internal restaurant....  They…"
4,"The hotel is located in Nusa Dua an area of 5 star hotels.There is no litter anywhere, the flowers and tropical gardens getting into the resort are beautiful and tight security checks of all cars just to get into the area. The reception area is stunning, large lagoon ponds full of fish, and flowers. The hotel is big and is spread on a large area.Rooms are very spacious and the beach is very beautiful and ideal place to relax."

4,"I was stuck on Bali for an extra day because of the airport closure and needed a room.  I like the Hyatt chain and so opted for them.  This not really a Grand Hyatt - says it is but it's a 600 bed village basically.  Everything was well maintained, the room was a good size and I opted for a sea view.  Staff were efficient and polite, breakfast was good and overall, the hotel did what it was supposed to do; give me a good night's sleep and feed me well in the morning.  I'm only opting for 4 not 5 stars because it's too big to be a proper Grand Hyatt, some of the rooms at the back are about a 3 minute walk to the beach and just to get to my room from reception at the end of a long day seemed like a marathon."
4,It is a wonderful experience for us to spend our first holiday at the tranquil atmosphere of the Grand Hyatt. we will not hesitate to recommend the Grand Hyatt to our friends or come back in the future.
5,"We just recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt on a Luxury Escape package. It is a beautiful relaxing resort everything you need is well catered for.  The room was large, comfortable bed with a lovely view? There is a variety of Restaurants catering to every taste a large rambling pool which never felt crowded with a kids section. We would love to stay here again and recommend it to everyone.  Rosemary"
4,We stayed at the Bali Hyatt on the 8 night Scoopon package. The resort grounds are stunning and the deal was great value for a 5 star resort. The restaurants have prepared special menus for the Scoopon deals  which meant the meals were smaller and the choices restricted. The spa treatments are amazing although if you were paying normal prices they are well above prices you pay for the same treatments in Australia. The lagoon view rooms are much nicer than the 'secret pool view room'.
5,"We first stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali more than 15 years ago.  We've tried a couple of other places in Bali, but nothing quite matches the ambiance, friendly service, well-maintained facilities at the Grand Hyatt.  When we arrive there, relaxation is instant and we always enjoy our stay.  Wonderful staff make our stay even more perfect.  And our son loves the water-slide.  Can't wait to come back. The hotel has been around for awhile, but they work hard to keep it updated, clean and inviting. Use of the Club Lounge is frosting on the cake."

5,"It has been over 20 years since I last went to Bali and I was a little hesitatant in returning, but as soon as I arrived at Nusa Dua I knew I had made a great choice. To be fair Nusa Dua is basically an area of 5 star hotel chains, there is no litter anywhere, the flowers and tropical gardens getting into the resort are beautiful and there is security checks of all cars just to get into the area. The Grand Hyatt did not disappoint, on arrival the reception area is stunning, large lagoon ponds full of fish, beautiful high vaulted ceilings and staff to welcome you everywhere. They let the kids bang the huge gong to welcome your arrival which is a nice touch.  We were booked into a ground floor lagoon facing room, yes the room is a bit dated but I think it is striving for a…"
3,"It's a luxury destination, but not very well managed comparatively.  The club level is very poor compared to Nikko or Conrad in Nusa Dua.  We moved from Nikko, and there was no comparison of the club levels...Nikko had private pool and very good wine, great service....Hyatt had cheap local wine (worst wine I've ever had) and a very poor lounge, and really no service.  Not what is expected at club level.  Room was not ready when we arrived, so they asked us if we would like to pay to upgrade to a bigger room that was ready, we declined.  Apparently they had overbooked, or just not prepared it,  so they gave us the bigger room anyway for no charge.  But a bit cheeky trying to get us to pay first to cover their mistake.  Very good grounds, a lot of shops, a good resto on the beach,…"
5,"Fantastic 3 week holiday. We had an Ocean view room so woke every morning to a beautiful sunrise and an idyllic view of the pristine beach and sea. The Kids Club is great and the gymnasium also very good. The hotel grounds are beautiful and tended to every day. The pools are also beautiful. The restaurants are good, especially the buffet at the signature restaurant which puts on the Balinese performance every night. There is the benefit of a shopping complex a short walk away with many shops and restaurants. PLUS a Starbucks!"
5,"Very recommended hotel in Bali, away from the city but very quite and all guest required it is available in the hotel, with very good facilities in pool and beach. Rooms are clean and equipped with all of what you need in such island. Really nice experience and it is highly recommended to stay in this hotel."
4,"Resort location and facilities are some of the best especially if you are traveling with children. Quite big, great pool, waterslide for kids etc. Rooms are very old and furniture and side bedding may smell."

4,"Positives - hotel grounds, pools and rooms  really nice. We had a club room which included breakfast and evening drinks. The club area is to the left of the resort and quieter. Nice choice of restaurants and of the staff we came across - friendly, remember your name etc makes for a great experience.   If you can afford it, the villas look awesome - sadly we didn't stay here.  Not sure how old the Hotel is maybe 15 years. It's well maintained for age but not super sharp or brand new. No issues from me though.   Overall very good hotel and would come back. "
5,Stayed at The Grand Hyatt Bali in July would recommend this wonderful hotel to everyone as it suits young or old. Beautiful lagoons all around the hotel.  Swimming pools winding around hotel are  just wonderful either to relax  beside or swim. Lots of  shade around under the magnificent trees plus umbrellas if you so desire. Right next to the beach too.  Also great shopping complex just 5 min walk away You never need to leave the resort to have a beautiful holiday.
3,"As frequent visitors of Bali, we like the location of this hotel. Friendly staff, great gym & personal coach! Garden, pools and surroundings are beautiful. Rooms and beach furnitures are outdated. Breakfast is far below the standard compared to other hotels in Nusa Dua such as Nikko, Westin and also compared to other hotels like Intercontinental (Jimbaran), Bali Hyatt (Sanur) and lower class hotels like Novotel (Benoa)"
5,"Had a very relaxing stay here for the X'mas-New Year 2015 week break. We instantly liked the vast and elegant property and grounds that blended modern comforts with beautiful local architectural elements. The staff (reception, restaurants, housekeeping etc) were warm, polite and efficient throughout our stay, the epitome of Balinese hospitality. We had a very comfortable and spacious king room with a balcony overlooking the lagoon and gardens. The hotel is well located by the clean and uncrowded beaches of Nusa Dua, where we spent most of our time relaxing on the deck chairs or swimming. We also made good use of the well equipped gym and pool during our stay. The buffet breakfast was something to look forward to every morning, with the outstanding variety of the spread on offer.…"

The hotel is well located by the clean and uncrowded beaches of Nusa Dua, where we spent most of our time relaxing on the deck chairs or swimming. We also made good use of the well equipped gym and pool during our stay. The buffet breakfast was something to look forward to every morning, with the outstanding variety of the spread on offer.…"
4,"We recently visited the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua as part of the Luxury Escape Promotion We loved the hotel and its friendly staff. The position Nusa Dua was extremely handy to the beach and Bali Collection with sits vast variety of shops and restaurants. Luxury Escape have garden views which are fine but would have preferred a view of the ocean. Restaurants are very good and in particular the Japanese one, though you do need to book early for Tepinyaki. Only complaint was the bed a touch hard. Loved the stay though."
5,Excellent.. The hotel keep me and my family coming back every year. The private beach is very clean. Easy to find food at the good restaurant at Nusa Dua area. We can visiting lot of stores at Bali collection.
4,"Staff are, without exception, pleasant, friendly and competent. Our room was good without being exceptional but is located in magnificent grounds and had a balcony overlooking the Indian Ocean. The beach is great but, if you bring children, the undercurrent is very strong - keep them in the resorts pools rather than the sea. Good range of restaurants but, if you're looking for nightlife, this is not the place for you. This is a place to relax, well away from Kouta etc. It is in a gated area where the major resorts are located. If you want to get into Denpasar you will need to take a taxi. Bali Connections supermarket is three minutes walk away and beer and soft drinks are cheaper there as well as a range of restaurants and shops. Our only problem (and it was a major one but not…"
4,Very nice resort. Very clean and beautiful setup. Only weakness is the insufficient breakfast capacity which leads to extensive waiting periods. It seems difficult to find enough English speaking waiters.
1,"From the poor wait for cooked food at breakfast, to the incompetent staff at both restaurants and reception (with limited ability to speak and / or understand basic English) to our absolute disgust at our treatment of our 4 year old who fell and needed surgery for injuries sustained at their slippery pool / stair surfaces I cannot more than say stay away from this crap and expensive hotel.  I have been to Bali 8 times (7 times in Legian / Kuta district) and have never received such blatant discrimination behaviour toward Australians as such in this over priced / Japanese oriented hotel environment.  After promising to make our stay ""as comfortable as possible"" after my child's injuries we received nothing but a free ride ride to the hospital and an oversized t shirt to say…"

5,"always best memories for relaxing, have a fun, water activities. best nature, best smell, very clean, best behavior on their staff. best holidays ever. best restaurants, best food and beverages. best pool bar. best beach and nature. at last best manager ."
5,"This was our 4th stay at this fabulous hotel. Even though Bali has a huge selection of hotels and accomodation to choose from, we have found a true gem - the Grand Hyatt. We have stayed at numerous hotels in Bali and this is our favourite. The property itself sits on very large acreage and is fully landscaped with numerous pools and ponds. The big bonus is the water slide, which is a hot favourite with the kids and will keep them entertained all day long as well as the parents.  We never feel crowded nor have any issues securing a deck chair around the pool or anywhere else, even when the hotel has an 80% occupancy rate. You don't get that high rise and closed in feeling either, as the hotel is spread out and has alot of vegetation, which gives it a very green feeling. If you…"
5,"The nine days at the Grand Hyatt would have to be the best holiday ever! The location, the grounds with their lush and colourful vegetation the tranquillity of the terraced ponds, waterfalls fish and bird life all acted as a salve to the stressed soul. The staff were delightful, they went out of their way to be friendly,attentive and helpful. Choice of many restaurants and bars meant that there was variety of food and wine of high standard.  Perfect for adults  and adults with children. In short, simply perfection."
5,"A beautiful and expansive property. The resort is greatly laid out and landscaped with many areas to enjoy. Service thru out is extremely friendly and helpful with many activities and options offered during our stay. Pools and diverse areas are definitely kid friendly, our daughter had a blast. Saddly we could not spend more time at the resort as we wanted to explore the island, happily would go back."
5,"Close to the beach, well worth the view . Staff were amazingly friendly and always greeted you when they passed you in the hall. View was stunning, lots of freebies throughout resort (flowers on arrival, bath with petals prepared in room, smoothies and cold towels by the pool, chips at the bar etc, etc). The Plus side: - priority access"

4,"We stayed in Grand Hyatt Bali for 3 nights in March 2015. The hotel is a resorts style with many options of recreational activities and restaurants. You can spend your whole holiday in the hotel without getting bored. At the evening, small shops will open to sell locally-made souvenirs and local band would play music and perform dancing which create charming atmosphere.  The rooms are located in many separate building-blocks distributed over fairly large area surrounded by all type of tropical trees and water ponds. While walking around, you can enjoy observing various types of interesting creatures moving & hiding in a peaceful manner (birds, frogs, reptiles, etc). The rooms were spacious and clean despite the humidity smell. The breakfast was very good. You can hire a car with…"
5,"Holiday was great highly recommend and would go back, facilities great and food fantastic. Very relaxing and close to shops. Spa was lovely. We had a 3 yr old who was well catered for both food and kids club was great."
5,"We were worried about remodeling and other inconveniences that hotels often have and that we read that we might see.  We saw none of that an had a perfect stay.    Our room was well maintained and with a newborn they brought us an entire case of water.  They cleaned the room a couple of times a day and were there for everything we needed.  The beach was amazing and the water beautiful, no trash at all. We enjoyed treatments in the spa and enjoyed those also.  Our only complaint, and you can read it in many reviews, is that breakfast is a zoo!  We were advised to eat in Watercourt restaurant, which we were told would be quieter and less people.  We took their advice and had better breakfasts the last couple of days we where there.  Other than that our stay was perfect and we will…"
5,"Our recent stay at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua Bali was very excellent. From the moment of checking in and throughout our stay to our checkout day, we enjoyed it. The staffs were very friendly, fast in responding our request, the room was nice though a bit old. We'd surely come back when we visit Bali again."
5,"The hotel is very elegant from the moment you arrive. The gardens and ponds are simply beautiful and we booked a seaview room so we felt truly spoilt with the view.  We upgraded to Club and found the service in the lounge simply amazing. The breakfast is generous, fresh and peaceful and the afternoon cocktails are a real treat and a nice way to meet other hotel guests. I hope to return next year :)"

5,Loved the gardens and lagoons and the open public areas. Good beach with rare on beach tree line which provided good shade. Food was of a high quality and service was friendly and professional. Was on a Luxury Escapes package and would happily recommend the Resort
5,This is an excellent resort for family.it has many pools and many restaurants.ideally located on the beach front which is very quite and peaceful.outside the hotel complex is a big market with shopping and many restaurants and  spas.so ideally located with variety of choice.
4,"Our 2nd stay at the Grand Hyatt, this time with 3 kids (16, 12, 10).  The rooms are large, all with balconies. The daybed is perfect for a 3rd kid (beats fights over who's in the rollaway).  Despite the fact that they advertise recently renovated rooms, ours certainly showed signs of wear and tear, for eg. bathroom fixtures.  Its a very large hotel but never felt crowded, never had trouble finding chairs around their fantastic pools.  Lots of shade too which is a must for us.  River pool and waterslide great fun  for kids, the lagoon pool expansive, Balinese pool beautiful in the late afternoon.  Pool bar service and menu suited us with pizzas, pasta, burgers, sandwiches, never any trouble asking for kids portions.  The hotel is very laidback, perhaps too laidback, and could…"
4,"I found the experience good overall. The staff were excellent at all venues, very efficient for a resort. Facilities were all we expected and needed. There are enough things to do to keep young ones occupied daily. the dining facilities give you a good selection of food but if you are a wine drinker you will find the range small and expensive."
5,"this hotel with the most stunning landscape and fabulous restaurants has to be one of the best in the world. My stay here was like ""heaven on earth"" and I am a well traveled luxury loving person. I can not find any complaints excepting with a push...the wine list which needs less Indonesian wine (not to our taste) and a more excellent Australian or good European selection. My fears of Bali were laid to rest in this beautiful paradise mmmmmm"

5,"My family and I (husband and 2 boys aged 7 & 8) recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. On arrival, we were shown to our room, which was helpful as the resort is HUGE. We were upgraded to an Executive King Suite (from a King Suite), which was a large 141 square meter room, too big for what we needed, but we weren't conplaining! To comfortably house 2 adults and 2 kids, the normal King Suite would have been large enough. The room was well pointed, with all the bells and whistles you'd expect in a 5 star resort room. The room was serviced daily and we were given fresh fruit and bottled water.   The daily breakfast was good, not an expansive as other places we've stayed in, but plenty of food to fill you up until dinner. The variety of restaurants in the resort was excellent.…"
5,"We stayed for 8 days in June and although getting home was a bit of a drama due to the volcanic ash crisis our stay at The Grand Hyatt was stunning. We were so surprised at the quality of the service and package inclusions in the Luxury Escapes package. Such great value for money, fantastic food, gardens and experience. We will be back, the staff at Grand Lounge were great friendly and helpful."
5,"Great family resort on the beach at Nusa Dua. Quiet family friendly resort. All the facilities you need, walking distance to mini marts, restaurants, shopping etc. The shops and restaurants are slightly more expensive because your in Nusa Dua compared to Kuta but food was beautiful. The resort food could not be faulted. Exellent staff rervice, great range of restaurants in the resort. Awesome pool, the kids loved spending time in the resort pool. The whole resort was so clean and tidy. Metered Taxi's to Kuta approx $11 Australian one way which took about 1/2 hr depending on traffic. We would definately stay again."
5,"October 2003 Review: I stayed here for a company trip and the hotel room was perfect. First, the hotel has an Asian-theme look and feel, so it's nothing like the more modern Hyatts I've stayed in...this one is unique and gorgeous. The room is nice and clean, and the bath room had a rain shower, loved it! We arrived really late at night, maybe around 11pm, so after check in, it was close to midnight with no restaurants open. The concierge was nice enough to let the hotel driver take us to a local restaurant that was still open. Unfortunately we only stayed for three nights and because we had a busy schedule, we didn't get a chance to try any of the restaurants here. We had drinks at the bar whenever we had a chance, but really, most of our time was spent down town. If you have…"

5,This magnificent hotel is set in wonderful gardens of frangipani and bouganvillia with fish ponds full of water lilys. It is situated on the beach front. The buildings and facilities are stylish an the bigger guest rooms are amazing. The staff are very friendly and professional. I don't think I can stay anywhere else now.
3,"When you arrive at the resort you are greeted with a wonderful view and expectations are high. However this is brought down to earth very quickly once you interact with staff and eat at the restaurants. This has become a mass produced resort now and lacks the polish and final touches of a five star hotel.  The good: - Private beach in a good location in Nusa Dua. - Spacious gardens which are well maintained. - Our boys enjoyed interacting with the fish, ducks, frogs, etc.  The bad: - Breakfast is chaotic and lacks variety. - Reception and some restaurant staff are rude. - Prices of the restaurants match five star hotels in Australia. - Besides the waterslides and pools there is a lack of free activities for children. Even had to pay to use the table tennis table ($10 for the…"
5,We loved our stay here. We travelled with 2 young kids aged 5 and under and it was a fantastic relaxing holiday. Beautiful well kept manicured lawns set upon a private beach. Lots of natural shade to lay under on deck chairs. Has a slide which the kids thoroughly enjoyed even our youngest who was 1.5 at the time couldnt get enough! Gym is 1st class!! Welcolming friendly staff. A selection of restaurants to eat at. There was a balinese buffet night which you should at least try 1nce as the food was lovely and was followed by a balinese show. The cocktails are really delicious especially the pina colada! Very well made. Most nights we ate out at the Bali Collection opposite the resort as was much cheaper than eating in resort. There was a selection of cuisines to cater for all…
3,"This hotel is lovely, spacious, clean, friendly staff and lovely facilities, BUT The resort is expensive for lunch and dinner and no where close near by except other expensive hotels. Activities are 5 times the price of Seminyak - if available at all. I.e surfboard hire etc all charged at high prices compared to the rest of Bali.If you want to stay in one place and never leave the hotel it's fine, but there are better options such as 4 star hotels in Seminyak where you can adventure out and see Bali if you want - very hard to do from Nusa Dua."
5,"We was there  july 2nd to 9 th. It was great. A dreamy place for relaxing. Our room was in the west village of hotel. It was surronded by  many lotus ponds. Many red fish and lizards was there. But totally hotel is safe. It's highly recomanded to nature's lovers. There were many breakfast boufet, you can choose the place, but menus was same. Our room was near to one of them, the staff were friendly and breakfast was ok. But salsa verde (one if the open breakfast boufet) was very populated and we didn't like it. We prefered to eat breakfast in boufet near our room. I liked the loby because it was situated in a open space and it was very well decorated. Our room number was 4106 and had a garden view,in the first floor, but I think it's bether than ocean view. The gardens were very…"

5,"Grand Hyatt is a super luxury resort and spa for a romantic getaway or family vacation! It has a private beach access and a variety of amenities to pamper the guests!

Our driver was very friendly and helpful with our luggages. He spoke excellent English. During our 40min ride, he gave us lots of interesting info on the resort and about the local attractions.    The pampering of our stay started at the gorgeous grand hotel entrance, where the staff welcomed us cheerfully and ushered us through a beautiful, long corridor between two charming ponds to the luxuriously appointed waiting lounge for our smooth check…"
3,I went to a conference. The hotel is vast and the shlep back and forth to the just ok room was very wearing. Other delegates complained about bugs and damp. Food felt international and service around the pool intermittent. Sea looked pretty daunting. Not special
4,A good escape and beautiful grounds. Pools could be a little cleaner (bit of a scrub daily would help) but overall a fantastic grounds and good rooms for experience of tranquility. I would recommend this as a good family stay and beautiful surrounds.
5,"wonderful service form the moment you arrive.  Great amenities for the whole family, room size excellent . Our 3 children loved the water slide and activities. Lovely restaurant's and children's menu. would stay here again and recommend this hotel."
5,"I stayed in this hotel for my business trip in June 2015. Mr. Indra Siartihika was my hotel contact person and I have to say big thank you to him for his professionality, availabilty and always prompt reply to my clients requests. I consider this property among the best in Nusa Dua area and perfect for both meetings and incentives."

5,"An excellent hotel with excellent service. Venue and shops in general area a little bit costly compared to other areas of Bali. For service, quality, options for eating. Excellent surrounds and the pools are really great. It was good to have more than one option for where we went to breakfast."
4,"Arriving at the Grand Hyatt Bali, feels like arriving in paradise. As you enter the resort you are surrounded by manicured Balinese gardens, lakes, restaurants and swimming pools. The service is excellent but don't be fooled by the price. Once you add taxes and services taxes on top, you are truly paying the price of paradise. Also watch out for bill a few times during your stay as I found out a full meal (which I didn't order) was added to my account. The hotel is located in Nusa Dua which is fantastic for families with small children and anyone wishing to chill out by the pool. Should you be after a bit more action during your holidays perhaps look for accommodation in Seminyak"
4,"Exceptional service of Hyatt chains are definitely represented in this resort.  Many selection of restaurants available on the premises. The check in and check out process were also a bliss. The downfall was on the room condition. Even though that the room is well maintained and clean., but the futures and furniture are visibly aged. "
4,"This is a very nice hotel with great amenities and a good staff. My family enjoyed our stay and enjoyed the location.   With this in mind, I was a little disappointed based on my experiences at other Grand Hyatts around the world. One of the biggest issues is the lack of concierge. They have a guest services desk and the people working there really do not know the surrounding areas nor could they make recommendations on some of the top sites for their guests. The food was also hit or miss. One dinner was excellent and one breakfast was the opposite. There was also a bit of inconsistency with the front desk staff (most were good but a few were pretty poor). This level of inconsistency is certainly not what I am accustomed to when staying at a Hyatt.   If you stay here you will…"
2,Back in 2012 I stayed in this Hotel and decided to go back to spend my birthday there. Bad call.  The Hotel was undergoing reformations in the diverse Villas due to this it becomes a lyberinth to get from one side of the Hotel to other as certain areas are close to public. Even though there are posted signs that indicate how-to get to Lobby they are not exctually very well indicated.  Check in was smooth and okay. Front desk were responsive and accurate. When the hostess took us (3 pax. 2 rooms) to our room she explained us the Hotel facilities but provided wrong information about the breakfast's opening and closing time of every restaurant (she claimed breakfast concluded at 11:00 am when it actually was at 10:30 am).   For the next 2 days after my check in I walked each…

5,"A very ""zen"" resort, with well maintained balinese gardens, good restaurants, very nice people and above all - zen atmosphere. The resort offers access to a large private beach and has also a gym, many pools, tennis court and many more to enjoy a good and relaxing vacation."
5,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali for 13 nights from June 14-27. I was hoping that our stay would be memorable as the holiday was for a special birthday surprise from my husband.    What a wonderful time we had at the Grand Hyatt Bali. An absolutely stunning hotel. Beautiful gardens, extremely friendly staff and a fantastic view of the ocean from our balcony. Anywhere we walked in the hotel we were greeted with a smile and a Good Morning, Good Afternoon etc. from the staff. There were always plenty of sunbeds around the pool and on the beach.  Dining at the Pasar Senggol was fabulous! Food was superb and then a Bali show to watch afterwards. We enjoyed it so much we went three times.  We will definitely be back!"
5,"I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt with a family group of 12, with ages ranging from 6 to 68 and everyone had a wonderful time. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, the grounds and facilities are excellent, the food is delicious and the Kriya Spa is first class. We will return!"
5,"We spent 10 nights at the Grand Hyatt and loved every minute of it. The hotel room is very spacious, and even though we were sharing with our two children, it didn't feel cramped. We had a ground floor lagoon room which had its own little island, which we loved as the kids had a bit of extra space outside. The swimming pools are beautiful and the water slide was a huge hit, keeping our kids entertained for days! Food was delicious at all the restaurants we ate at. We bought a deal using a Scoopon which included a number of meals and it was excellent value - we've never eaten so much in our lives! The Teppanyaki restaurant was divine. The staff were very accommodating and happy to make up special request meals for our fussy eaters. The only slight negative for us was that the…"
5,"We could only dream of such a resort/hotel.  This holiday was the best ever.  It was fantastic.  If you just wanted to relax, it was there for you to relax.  If you wanted to get active, you could. Your wish was their command.  Food in all the different areas was to behold.  Thank you Grand Hyatt, our holiday was perfect.  See you next year."

4,"We travelled as a family group to celebrate our daughters 11th Birthday.  The gardens and grounds are exquisite and we so enjoyed strolling amongst them and spending our time here.  Overall the trip was lovely, we cant fault the restaurants or the staff.  Nampu was the standout for us, lunch at the Garden Café was fantastic.  How we loved a coffee at the Persona Lounge with the sea breeze.  The pool staff was probably the least attentive and as the Hyatt is across from Bali Collection, often we grabbed our own supplies for beside the pool.  Breakfast was such a busy time, and despite the crowds the way in which it was handled by the staff is to be commended, they remained polite and attentive to everyone.  The food was replenished and it was lovely.  The rooms are probably…"
4,Very friendly and humble staff. Excellent facilities to relax. Fruit on arrival.  Able to use facilities even after checkout time because Emirates flight only leave at 11pm .  A beautiful hotel indeed. Loved the open spaces. Very good breakfast. Good value for money. The hotel rooms a bit outdated although clean.
5,"My son and his family and friends came to celebrate his 40th birthday.We had the best time at the resort. I have travelled all over Europe many times and regard this holiday as one of the best ever. Everything was great, the location, the resort and the staff.Would recommend to anyone as a great place to go."
5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali is simply one of the best 5-Star Resorts I have visited. My family loved it even more - wife plus two young boys aged 7 and 9 had the holiday of a lifetime ! And for Mum and I, the fact that my children ""wanted"" to go back to Kid's Club every day because of the beautiful and kind staff - says it all. Every restaurant is superb. Every staff member was polite and attentive. The resort itself was astounding and a real venue. Even the local lizards were friendly !! I simply could not recommend Grand Hyatt Bali enough. Try it for yourself - you will not be disappointed. And trust me, I don't hand out recommendations too often. This is the exception."
1,"I was travelling with a close family group of 20 people and had a very poor experience with Hotel. They offered us some very poor rooms facing tennis court. Even after having multiple round of discussion hotel was not able to offer good rooms. Even they lied about the availability of ocean facing rooms, though they were available in plenty on most of the travel portals and we were willing to pay for upgrade. I have stayed in 10+ grand Hyatt's worldwide, but this one was disappointing. I wish, I would have booked another hotel at least giving you a view to enjoy."

5,"We recently stayed for 10nights as a package, the north village wing has 49sqm large totally refurbished rooms.  Very clean & peaceful - friendly staff- access to the beautiful white sand beach. well serviced areas for meals  worthy of 5 STAR RATING we have stayed in 3 other hotels in the area - this is the BEST. we have booked another 3 visits over the coming 12 months  Great for Kids for all people."
4,"The Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua is enormous, the staff are lovely, food is good, location is brilliant and the security is second to none.  The resort is one of the oldest in the area and it is starting to show. The pool is in need of maintenance. The extensive gardens are immaculate and very well maintained.   We received an average check in, perhaps because our flight was delayed and we arrived around 11pm. The bags were taken to our room, however we were not told were the restaurant was for breakfast or even a quick explanation of the resort facilities.   There is a a broad range of food, however for the most part the quality is average. Nampu, the Japanese restaurant had the very best food.   We stayed in a suite, which was very modern and incredibly spacious. Room service do a…"
5,This is our 5th time that my family visited the Grand Hyatt.  We really feel at home and the staff are just amazing.  It is a great place for children with lots of space for them to run around.  The good is great and the location is superb and quiet. We always look forward for a great holdiay and rest at the Grand Hyatt Bali.
5,"my family has been to Bali 8 times and mostly stay at Nusa Dua.  Grand Hyatt has the best private beach around with clean sand and calm waves, plus multiple pools for all ages.  Rooms are big and clean with extra meditation space for kids to sleep or play around.  Great views no matter if it's garden or ocean view.  Huge and well maintained campus, don't really need to go out, being in the campus is relaxing enough."
4,"If i have a chance to visit Bali, I will come to Hyatt again. it was nice place, good garden, and nice pool. The food was very nice specially breakfast. People is very good and kind. However,  when you buy something or food, the price was not cheap but little bit expensive."

5,"Do not hesitate to get to this wonderful address and stay twice as long as planned. Unfortunately the alcohol is expensive in Indonesia, so cross the road to the Bali Collection shopping centre supermarket and stock-up from day one.You won't need to go any further afield to thoroughly enjoy a marvellous holiday; this place has everything and more. Ask Adhika Sutrisno who is the Manager of the Salsa Bar and Salsa Restaurant to look after you when there. Enjoy an extensive range of eateries, activities and beautifully friendly and obliging management and staff. We had reason to accept superb medical attention here too. Thoroughly recommendable without hesitation. We travelled there on a Luxury Escapes Package - just great."
4,"One thing we noticed is that the staffs we met from our arrival until we walk into our room aren't very friendly. They are kind and helpful enough for a 5 star resort, but never made us feel special. When we were checking in, we were given one access card for our room. As the front desk staff handed us to another staff who was going to guide us to our room, I asked for an additional card as there was more than one of us, but I was told to come back later to get it. We stayed in a number of different hotels far cheaper than less reputable than Hyatt where staffs will happily make this extra key without asking their guest to come back.  When our luggage arrived, we haven't had chance to stop by the money exchange on that day so had very little cash on us, so when we handed a small…"
5,"Recently my wife and I stayed for nine nights at the Grand Hyatt.  We had a ground floor Lagoon-side room.  What an experience.  We have both travelled extensively and found this hotel to be one of the best we had ever stayed in.  The staff, without exception were amazingly helpful and attentive, the food was glorious, wonderful restaurants, the environs beautiful, housekeeping of room really above and beyond good.  The spa and massage treatments  were wonderful.  During our stay my wife had a bad back and the staff, without asking, delivered her breakfast to our room and were very attentive to make her feel more comfortable for a few days.  We felt pampered and priveliged at The Grand Hyatt and will DEFINITELY be returning in the future!"
5,"The 8 night Luxury Escapes Package at the Grand Hyatt was excellent and is highly recommended. The grounds of the hotel are magnificent, the standard of maintenance of the entire hotel is excellent, the package benefits excellent value, and the staff very impressive and friendly.  Our room over looking the Balinese pool was delightful and quiet. The hotel occupies 5 acres and is spread out so there is a reasonable amount of walking, but the water features, bougainvillea and frangipani are so beautiful every walk has delightful vistas. The food included in the package was very good as were the added services (massages, manicures etc)."
5,"I recently planned and held a conference at the Grand Hyatt Bali spending over a week on the property on two different visits and interacting with every department within the resort. Both as a hospitality professional and a traveler I have nothing but great things to say about the Grand Hyatt. They exceeded my expectations on every level. It is a gorgeous sprawling property with an incredibly service driven staff.  The rooms are clean, spacious and well appointed. One of my favorite aspects of the rooms may seem silly but it isn’t something very commonly found in many hotels, there are locking screen doors in addition to the French doors going to the patio of your room. Many nights, as a person who doesn’t enjoy overly air-conditioned spaces, I slept with just the screen doors…"

When you first walk you will be greeted by the gorgeous koi ponds and excellent service. The location is excellent because it's just a walk away from a shopping outlet named Bali Collections.  The rooms were cleaned nicely and were very comfy . They delivered us delicious fruits when they stopped by to clean the rooms. The food was delicious, but all the buffets taste the same. There are many places to take pictures of your family on Grand Hyatt's ""campus"". The pools are very warm and there are many places to swim. With the rocks and flowers in the pool, I felt like I was in a tropical paradise. The pool is very nicely built with a waterslide,…"
5,"Our first trip to Bali and what a wonderful way to experience it. A beautiful, tranquil place with fantastic staff. A great 5 star resort to stay at with children. Our daughter was treated like a princess and was kept entertained with  pool and waterslide for hours. Couldn't have asked for a better holiday. We will be back!"

5,"Bali was the end of a great but also exhausting journey through south-east Asia. The Grand Hyatt Bali was the perfect place to relax after the weeks of endless traveling. The Hotel has the biggest private beach I have see so far and is very safe and clean. The staff is absolutely nice and if you book an executive room, like we did, you get to enjoy the feature of the wonderful executive lounge, where you can enjoy free drinks and snacks.   The Hotel is basically a small village with many different Restaurants, Bars and Places to have fun or Relax. The Spa for example is simply one of the best we have seen so far. But it also offers Tenniscourts and a well equipped gym for those who like to work out.   If you have children the big main pool offers you a great playground to spend…"
5,"The hotel never disappoints, from the time you arrive till departure everybody has a welcoming smile. If you can manage to stay in the grand club the experience is world class. The manicured gardens and well maintained pools (along with the beach) are a delight. Thank you all for another memorable stay. Will be back again next year.  "

5,"The beautiful Grand Hyatt Bali has to be the best hotel/resort I have ever stayed at. The staff are all exceptional in friendliness, professionalism and service and we felt like VIPs from the moment we arrived to the (very sad) day we had to go home. We stayed 8 nights on a LuxuryEscapes voucher which included buffet breakfast, one lunch, afternoon tea and 3 dinners, as well as wonderful spa treatments.    The Kriya Spa is out of this world. We had a 60 min massage included in our package. At the spa we were taken to a private villa and after a blissful Balinese massage the staff kindly arranged a lift for my mother (who has a bad hip)  back to reception in one of the hotel golf buggies (depending on the location of your room it is quite a walk to the spa). Nothing is too much…"
5,"Me, my wife and two kids had a really good time in the hotel. The environment is very serene and relaxing, and the room was stunning. There are som many things in the hotel that one would not want to go out from hotel. Highly recommended for family vacation."
3,"Dear all, We had with my wife 4 great days in Grand Hyatt Bali, facilities, staff, services, were all great. Nevertheless We regret the quality of the food that was really not at the level, for breakfast or diner, my wife even got sick after seafood in their restaurant called Salsa Verde. We tried only one restaurant however maybe others were better. We decided to dine outside. And the water in the room had a super strong bad smell, showering yourself was challenging and we used mineral water to brush our teeth. Except food and water (important point however) the place is amazing, great design, people are very nice. Hope this helps. Best, Mikael."
3,"Hotel is currently undergoing renovation but they should start with cleaning it first.  Not off a Hyatt standard and wouldn't go back.  Lizard by the pool bar had gone to the toilet by one of the tables and was not cleaned for over two days.  Food is average, breakfast is nice. Beach is amazing. Wouldn't stay here again,  go to the bali collection over the road for cheaper food and drink.   Do not stay here if you are looking to get around Bali easily isolated."
5,"This is one of the best resorts we've stayed in. Everything, right from the first interaction with them to the last one, was perfect.  The rooms are well built and designed, though it takes about 10 minutes on an average to reach any room from the Lobby. The staff, just like the people of Bali in general, are always smiling and are very helpful and courteous. The private beach is very clean. They have multiple pools, including pool for kids. There is a supermarket, which also accommodates several restaurants, just across the road from the hotel.   Highly recommended if you're looking for a great accommodation in Nusa Dua. "
5,"The beautiful Grand Hyatt Bali has to be the best hotel/resort I have ever stayed at. The staff are all exceptional in friendliness, professionalism and service and we felt like VIPs from the moment we arrived to the (very sad) day we had to go home. We stayed 8 nights on a LuxuryEscapes voucher which included buffet breakfast, one lunch, afternoon tea and 3 dinners, as well as wonderful spa treatments.    The Kriya Spa is out of this world. We had a 60 min massage included in our package. At the spa we were taken to a private villa and after a blissful Balinese massage the staff kindly arranged a lift for my mother (who has a bad hip)  back to reception in one of the hotel golf buggies (depending on the location of your room it is quite a walk to the spa). Nothing is too much…"
5,"Me, my wife and two kids had a really good time in the hotel. The environment is very serene and relaxing, and the room was stunning. There are som many things in the hotel that one would not want to go out from hotel. Highly recommended for family vacation."
3,"Dear all, We had with my wife 4 great days in Grand Hyatt Bali, facilities, staff, services, were all great. Nevertheless We regret the quality of the food that was really not at the level, for breakfast or diner, my wife even got sick after seafood in their restaurant called Salsa Verde. We tried only one restaurant however maybe others were better. We decided to dine outside. And the water in the room had a super strong bad smell, showering yourself was challenging and we used mineral water to brush our teeth. Except food and water (important point however) the place is amazing, great design, people are very nice. Hope this helps. Best, Mikael."
3,"Hotel is currently undergoing renovation but they should start with cleaning it first.  Not off a Hyatt standard and wouldn't go back.

5,What a fantastic place great staff and lovely surrounds. Whether you are holidaying with your family or just as a couple the Grand Hyatt Bali caters for all.If safety and security are one of your concerns then have no worry  it you choose the Grand Hyatt
3,"It was my first bad experience ever in five star hotel. We lost brand new branded sunglasses around swimming pool. I contacted a manager on duty. His response was far below my expectation. I was deeply disappointed. Services in their restaurants could also be better. There was no review paper in my room. So, how could they take credits for comments from their customers? However, hotel is great with beautiful beach and well taken care garden. I hope they improve much in the future. What a pity..."
4,"This was a resort. Nothing else. Bunch of group of tourists from Chinese charter. Really nosy and a lot of old people.  For someone who research a resort with service beautiful beach and swimming pool it's ok. But not at all Bali, you feel somewhere else. "
3,Recently stayed here on a Luxury Escapes deal and it was fantastic - got all meals and massages as included! All meals included were delicious and worth the value! Kriya Spa is delightful and had a beautiful massage with tea afterwards. Just one tip - DONT GIVE THEM YOUR CREDIT CARD
4,"I really dont think there is a bad hotel in Nusa Dua.  Hyatt is a massive property. IF you have any big meetings or any sales incentive trips go here!  Good staff, good selection of western food.  Beaches are nice and clean. Plenty of beach chairs. Just beware of the sales people"

5,"The Grand Hyatt Bali is a wonderful resort destination. From our pick-up at the airport to checkout, we found staff to be friendly and helpful. The hotel setting is lush, tropical and quiet. While we had worried about being some distance from the city, we found that getting to Seminyak and other places of interest was easy enough, and we enjoyed the quiet isolation of the resort as well. This is one of the best Hyatt experiences we have had. We particularly appreciated the wifi access throughout the resort, although reception was a bit spotty on the beach."
5,"excellent and highly recommend. I am here in Bali as I type and it is so good I decided to put finger to keyboard and say thanks to all the staff. from the gardeners, cleaners, waitresses and waiters to guest relations and anybody I have missed you are all super friendly and nothing is too much trouble.  We are staying in Club Ocean view and it's worth the extra. Not sure why one review suggested breakfast is poor, it's not. Any type of egg you want, bacon, mushroom, grilled tomato all cooked to order as are the omelettes. Breads, jams, fruit, yoghurt cheese, hams etc...I think you get the message. The dinner from 5-7pm is not extensive but it certainly is good along with any cocktail required.  The grounds are spectacular and extremely well maintained.  If I was to be critical…"
5,We have stayed here twice and loved it both times.  This time we had a room right on the beach which was perfect. Great view and close to the pool.  The pool side bar is great for food and drinks. The chicken tacos are very yummy.
4,"Fabulous hotel and grounds, beautiful staff who are very well informed, super ""white' beach.  Breakfasts great, teppanyaki restaurant very good.  Facilities terrific.  Wine list could include more Aussie/NZ wines - that was our only disappointment!!"
5,"We booked a luxury escapes package and i have to say that this is the best holiday i have ever been on! The food was amazing, the people were just beautiful, the pools and water slide are awesome, the ponds and gardens were serene. The extra spa and food vouchers we got were absolute bliss! We came with 2 small children so did not high expectations of it been a relaxing holiday but i have to say that was the most relaxed i've been in the last 6 years! The only slight dissapointment was the rooms were a bit dated but we didnt spend much time in there anyway.  I cant rate this place high enough.. Would definately come back. Thank you"

4,"All very good but too many screaming children in pools and rooms - did not sleep well, gardens spectacular & give great Bali feel, staff warm & helpful -a true Bali experience done with Style and panach"
4,First time in Nusa dua Hyatt a comfortable more traditional complex the gardens are relaxing and well maintained pool area large enough that you can find a quite place to sit and read. Close to other resorts if you are looking to eat upmarket shopping centre handy just across the road plenty of places to eat
5,"5 adults and twin 2 year old grandchildren. We had a ball. The service was excellent. The beach was great. Pools and the variety worked well for our group. Staff very friendly. Fish feeding, water slides and toddler pool were all a great hit for the twins. Japanese restaurant was amazing. Budi one of the very experienced wait staff was incredible. We loved her."
5,"The Grand Hyatt was fantastic. Rooms were great and roomy. Staff excellent and very courteous. Kids had a ball. Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a resort style holiday which is quiet, accommodating with the benefits of shopping across the road. I would also add very disable friendly. Dad needed a wheel chair and we could get to all aspects of the resort and my son needed crutches. All provided by the hotel at no charge."

5,"I just returned home after a fabulous 10 day vacation at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. Everything about this hotel is perfect. The room was excellent and easily accommodated 2 adults and 2 children. The hotel grounds are absolutely stunning and very well kept. The Salsa Verde is where we had breakfast daily. The staff there were very welcoming no matter what time we arrived and our children loved the freshly made pancakes. Speaking of staff, I can not speak highly enough of them, so accommodating, cheerful and helpful. The pool is stunning, trying to get the children to do something else each day was a challenge, they loved the waterslide. This is the only hotel I have ever been to that looks better in real life not just great in photos. If you want to holiday in a hotel that is…"
3,"Nice hotel. The staff is friendly (always smiling) and the pools are wonderful.  By all means, if you have access to the Grand Club (I am a Hyatt Gold Passport diamond member) use the exclusive Grand pool. It's a dedicated pool for guests who are eligible to use the Grand Club. It's really nice and it's completely private.  The only flaw in the restaurant is the food.  The first night we ate at Pasar Senggol. In spite of the appearances, it seemed the food had been pre-cooked and merely wormed on the spot. I had a few prawns and they were cold. So I went back to the grill and asked them to grill some fresh for me. I watched the attendant pull some pre-grilled prawns from a storage area, toss them briefly on the grill, and then serve them to me. They were not great but at least…"
5,"From the time we stepped into the hotel we were transported to a world of serenity. This is the perfect place for a complete shut down and to recharge. Great spa, great beach front, great pool, great Balinese buffet restaurant which also shows cultural performances... My pick is the beach front....you can either walk along its pearly shores or take a dip...for me it was lazying on beach chairs and watching the world go by.... For the avid shopper, Bali collections is just next door..."
4,I was lucky enough to stay here on a business trip recently.  My room was in the South Village and it was a pleasant room with a view of one of the lakes and beach glimpses. As an attendee of a conference there the facilities were great and also the refreshments were always very good.  The staff are very friendly.  Didn't get a chance to enjoy the pool or beach on my visit so I will just have to come back again.
5,"Our family, 4 adults and 2children booked through Luxury Escapes to stay here.  It is a fantastic resort, the sprawling gardens are manicured perfection and amazing.  The facilities are well suited to couples and families as it is a HUGE site, immaculately clean.  The food at all the Restaurants onsite is delicious and of the best quality.  We did walk across the road to a shopping precinct called Bali Collection and there are many cheaper eateries and bars there with something to cater for everyone.  There is also a large supermarket, Sogo and many small shops with Bali clothes and memorabilia, priced very reasonably.  Last but certainly not least were the staff, and there were many, were smiling, friendly and obliging.  Nothing was too much trouble, it was these people who…"

3,"Currently staying here and can only say I am really disappointed. I come to Bali every year with my daughters and usually get a family room at the Westin. We were told the Hyatt was better and booked here and have been excited for months. Overall it is just not up to the mark and is far surpassed by the Westin.  Why? Our rooms are tired and dated, the patio furniture is bleached from the sun, there are coke and beer bottles in the lake we overlook, our mirrors are chipped, the beds feel damp.  Outside, the pools are nice but the furniture is dated and the cushions are all dirty and stained.  Overall would not recommend and if it was not costing $400 a night would book out and into the Westin. Such a shame. "
5,"I stayed for 3 nights at this hotel last week on a business trip.  The services were excellent.  My company booked me at the standard room and then the hotel upgraded my room to the beach view room, right in front of the beach on the south wing, beauty!  The wifi worked perfectly in all areas of the hotel incl beach, swimming pool and restos.  The room was big but kind of old fashion. The bathroom was also big as they have a separate shower and bath tub. The hotel have 4 swimming pools but I only swim in the main swimming pool once in front of the resto.   They have many restos and four of which serve breakfast. I recommend having breakfast at the Salsa Verde near the pool and the beach.  The lobby area is beautiful just like Balinese house, but may need some refreshment. Some…"
5,"We have just returned from our stay at Grand Hyatt Bali and thoroughly enjoyed it. The grounds are beautiful, every staff member we encountered was genuinely lovely and helpful and the food was really good too! Well suited to familes, the kids loved the pools and of course the slide. We will definitely be back."

4,"I stayed here April of 2012 and I was 5 months pregnant and  I had a great time with my boyfriend.  They took care of me.  I was picky on foods and I noticed the staff would give me foods I believe they observed that I always eat.  They provided all I requested - milk, tea and biscuits.  They prepare your room for the night and they always give me a glass of milk and cookies before I slip.  The pool slide is also great! Very safe for adventurous pregnant crazy woman like me.  "
5,"It's the little things that this resort provided that made it such a wonderful week for us!  We took our little 18 month old toddler along with us and found that the resort was every bit suited to us as a family with a small child.  Little things like the baby bath and Johnson & Johnson baby bath soap, powder, oil pack etc along with a rubber duck and baby hand flannel placed in our room on arrival and the cot all set up and ready to go.   The big beautiful surprise was not only the reasonably priced onsite doctors appointment we made for our toddler on the first day, due to contracting a cold prior to departing Australia, but after that appointment the lovely get well and well wishes card placed in our room along with a cute tshirt for our little one!!!!! Fantastic touch Grand…"
5,"We were on a Luxury Escapes Package and all went very smoothly. The Resort was very picturesque and wildlife everywhere. Ducks,Birds,Water dragons,Fish and Squirrels. Rooms are roomy, service excellent. T.V. reception on English channels not the best.  Showers great. Pools are lovely and close to beach. Lots of shade at pools and on the beach. Close to the Bali Collection Shopping Center where they have some nice places for eating. We would definatly go back to this resort. Was an $11 AUD. metered blue taxi fare to Kuta one way."
5,"I want for a conference which never gave me any time to enjoy the heaven on earth but the mere fact that I stayed in this hotel gave helped me taste the ambience of Bali. If you want a true Balinese getaway, stay in this hotel - Club Room with Grand Club access definitely recommended.  Next time, will stay here as a guest for vacation."

Management please keep this in mind and recognize her for a job well done"

5,"First time using Luxury Escape and i am very pleased with resort service I received. We went to all 3 restaurants - very good, spa service exellent, room huge, bed very comfortable, plenty of bottle water, plenty of space near the pool - lots of sun beds, happy hours in the bar, very close to Bali Collection if you want to have meal outside, free WiFi - (very bad reception near the pool - have to go to my room or close to the lobby - that the only small negatives - but we can leave with that). Overall - luxury escape..."
3,"I last stayed at this hotel in 1998.  Based on my experience in 1998, I wanted to revisit this hotel and relive the beauty of the place.  The hotel property and grounds are as beautiful and as well-maintained as I remembered   - it's a sprawling property with great beach frontage and lush and pristine gardens.  It's obvious that significant time and resources are dedicated to maintenance of the gardens and it's well and truly worth it.  The hotel staff are warm, welcoming and accommodating (despite the language barrier at times).  A welcome addition to the hotel is the luxurious day spa - the Krysia Day Spa.  We enjoyed a relaxing 1 hour massage.  Whilst the spa is well designed and aesthetically pleasing, our massages were $120 USD per person.  This price is significantly…"

It's obvious that significant time and resources are dedicated to maintenance of the gardens and it's well and truly worth it.  The hotel staff are warm, welcoming and accommodating (despite the language barrier at times).  A welcome addition to the hotel is the luxurious day spa - the Krysia Day Spa.  We enjoyed a relaxing 1 hour massage.  Whilst the spa is well designed and aesthetically pleasing, our massages were $120 USD per person.  This price is significantly…"
5,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in the first week of June. While it was LOW season, it was absolutely lovely there and even better as there was hardly anyone there We had the pool to ourselves most mornings ! The food is absolutely beautiful, the services luxurious and the staff were amazing Would go back for sure"
5,"Club Lounge service and amenities are fantastic the staff are excellent and show great enthusiasm in making your stay with them most comfortable. Club pool and again service very good and so close to the private beach. Club rooms well-appointed and very comfortable for long extended stays.  Cleaning of the room was excellent morning make up and evening turn down immaculate.  The garden landscaping and maintenance is to be congratulated and Restaurant staff and food of World standard.  Concierge, transport desk excellent and helpful.  The entire resort is well groomed and would stay gain and again. Distance from Airport with the new course way makes and airport journey no more than 20-25 min.  Over all or Bali experience was excellent but the Grand Hyatt made our trip. Would…"
4,"The hotel is huge in terms of land area and divided in different zones. The room is nicely decorated and good in size with one queen size and one double bed. The view from balcony is nice which is facing two fish ponds in the front. Service is fine but the breakfast area is a bit too small to accomodate hotel guests at Christmas time. The breakfast variety and quality are not as good as what a 5 star hotel supposed to be. Compared to Hyatt Recency at Hua Hin Thailand, the variety and quality are superior to this Grand Hyatt. In general, this hotel is fine."
5,"My wife and I spent 4 nights at the Grand Hyatt. It was a stay we really enjoyed, completely filled with relaxation. On entering the hotel for check in we were amazed by the extent, beauty and tranquillity of the lobby. This was quickly turned to annoyance when we found out our room wasn't ready (this was at 4:30pm, 2.5 hours after check-in time). We stayed in a Deluxe Ocean View room in Block 3. The room was great. It had a nice comfortable king size bed and a bathroom with separate shower and bath. In the corner of the room was a daybed with a lovely view of the ocean. On the balcony was a table and 2 chairs. The block in which the room was in was very quit, especially seeing that the adjacent block was under construction.      The service at the hotel was amazing, possibly…"
5,"This hotel is absolutely beautiful, the grounds are huge and the hotel is situated within a complex itself with shops etc inside the gated area. The beaches and pools are lovely and the staff are extremely helpful. We chose to eat outside the hotel in the restaurants which are located a few minutes away walking. The holiday was lovely and the hotel made! Very relaxing and gorgeous views and grounds."

5,"From the easy airport pick up ,seamless check in ,we found our room clean modern and easily accessed. .nusa dua is calm and no hassle security gates to the area and again to the resort keep the area quiet.this is NOT kuta.  Breakfast included was at 2 spots garden room was pleasant used by most. Salsa verdi was by the pool and was great setting . Both had great variety of western and Asian food . Cerial fruit ,omelets ,pancakes etc. Service was great surrounding superb by the pool under a frangipani tree and the surf as a background to the pool. Massage at the spar good we went for the traditional bali 1hr and worth it for ease of access and setting . Can find cheaper but not the quality.. Beach is clean and wide but surf choppy at high tide and none at low tide . In between…"
4,"Like most Hyatt resorts, the grounds and amenities are awesome. Unlike a lot of Hyatt's though, the service falls a little bit short. That said it was mostly a good stay, despite the few hiccups here and there (we had no water for the first few hours we were there!).   For me, what made this resort go fro Average to Very Good was the medical staff they had on hand. I had Bali Belly for two days while at tis property and the on-call docs they had were GREAT. It changed my vacation from a disaster to...passible (no pun intended).   This was my first visit to Bali and while the property was great, it could have been plopped down anywhere (Mexico, Hawaii, etc). I guess that's Hyatt by design, so I won't knock it, but next time I'd pick a resort that isn't as sterile (especially for…"
5,"Wonderful scenery, staff, food and location. Every day was relaxing and truly beautiful views to the eyes. The pools and grounds are amazing. Variety of foods all within the safe hotel. Bali Collection close by for shopping and hotel had shops and markets too."
5,"We stayed here for 5 nights with our 4 kids in April.  We stayed in the Club area and had beautiful accommodations.  The kids loved the pools, the water slide, playing water polo, and taking surfing lessons.  The food in the Club area was fantastic and the staff were so friendly and wonderful.  The location was great as we could walk across the street to the mall for massages, fish spa and food if we wanted to.  The food at the hotel was quite good and the kids meals were very affordable.  We can't wait to go back!"
5,"The kids club plus adults only pool and spa were a big plus for us, and when the whole family was together the water slide and pool bar were big draw cards. These facilities gave us a good balance on the trip. The food options were amazing and the night market was a great bonus."

5,Excellent stay for 8 days. Staff only too happy to help with any request. Room was large and very clean. Serviced daily. Grounds are perfect and swim pools beautifully maintained. Check-in fast and friendly
4,"Good location at Nusa Dua area, nearby nice beach  and facility for swimming. For those who have limited time for shopping, it has small shopping area who offer reasonable price, slitely high due to the exclusive location. Staff services was good, they are very helpful. Nice big room till you really imazed with the layout and nice bali style outdoor decoration."
5,"The hotel ground and beach are gorgeous and well maintained.  Our executive room was spacious, vey well appointed, and comfortable.  The service at the Club Lounge and everywhere in the hotel is second to none.  We were sorry we had to leave after 4 days..."
5,"We Stayed here on a Luxury escapes voucher and had an exceptional time. I was worried that being a discount voucher holder may cheapen the experience provided, this was not the case. The place was beautiful and so large that it never felt busy. We would recommend this place to both couples and families and will most likely return with our children."
5,If you want to stay a spectacular resort which overlooks the ocean this is the place to go. It is away from the hustle and bustle but if you want some of that it is easy to get a taxi. The staff are very friendly. I would recommend having a spa treatment as it is out of this world!!! Relaxing ++

5,"This is our second stay at the Grand Hyatt and our experience was the same - highly enjoyable with exceptional service. Great check-in process, even in the middle of the night. Both trips I requested a baby cot and a day bed to be made up in our room and both times the request was fulfilled prior to arrival. Breakfast selection is comprehensive and there are two restaurants to choose from. The pools are huge, great for kids and plenty of sun beds to choose. The service is exceptional - true 5 star. Never had a single problem. The hotel is older and very well maintained and in a great spot in Nusa if that's your thing. Outstanding gardens and overall hotel design. Highly recommended for couples or those with young families. Dinner can get expensive however there are better and…"
4,Rooms good.....pool and pool slides were good......food and restaurants are not up to the mark.....kids learnt surfing and activity centre is great....overall a good experience.....food could have been better.  Bali collections is a open mall next to the hotel which is a great option for food if one does not want to eat in the hotel.  Action area kuta and seminiyak are 45 mins drive from the hotel
5,"We recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt using the luxury escape package. It was our first visit to Bali so were nervous after reading some of the reviews. However we were extremely impressed with the hotel. The staff were all very friendly and service was prompt and professional.  The grounds and pools are beautiful and the beach is very clean. There are lots of sun loungers around and plenty of space to relax. Our kids loved the water slide and spent hours on it. Only criticism is the main pool temperature was really warm and needed to be cooler to make it more refreshing. However that didn't stop us spending most of our time there.  Would recommend finding the Balinese Pool as not many guests used it and the water was cooler.  The rooms had everything we needed, the air con…"
5,"We booked this resort  to have a family Vacation, we had a group of 14 incluging children ranging inage from 1 to 7, and all had a wonderful time,  the Staff could not be nicer , especialy in the Restaurants,   at reception the communication at the counter was at times a little difficult , but eventualy it was sorted out to our satisfaction.   I can highly recomende to stay there,"
5,We had a very nice time there. The weather was really good. The hotel was excellent. The staff was very polite and helpful. Short distance to shopping malls. Everything was just fine. We wish to go there again!!!!!

4,"We just spent about 5 days attending a conference at the Grand Hyatt Bali.  This is one of the better resorts on the island, and we understand that it's one of the older resorts (perhaps 20 years).  Overall, we'd rate this a ""pretty good"" experience, and would recommend it to friends, especially those with children.  The Good: I don't think we've ever had more friendly and accomodating service than at the Grand Hyatt - Bali.  Our room (a Club Executive Suite) was roomy and well-appointed - a wonderful Ily coffee-maker, a terrific bathroom with two sinks, and a separate tub and shower, a comfortable bed, a great balcony and much more (even a yoga mat hanging in the closet).  The grounds were beautiful and impeccably maintained.  This property has more beach access than most of…"
5,"The reason I think this hotel is great value is because not only is it set in the most  beutifull well managed grounds , you only have to look around at other hotels and after speaking to other couples from other 5 star hotels we soon came to thinking that we had a bargain. It has by far the best beach And because the public beach path runs through the hotel next to beach , we sometimes overheard people commenting on "" how beutifull this hotel is "" and "" byfar the best hotel they have seen "" . So loverly to hear . We will definitely be back same time next year  Well done Hyatt team and keep it up"
4,"Wide open spaces, very traditional balinese decor. Peaceful and close to the Beach, comfy rooms. Central location to everything. easy transport.Everything you ask for in a balinese resort for the family."
4,"We enjoyed 8 blissful nights at this gorgeous hotel.  The rooms are spacious (watch out for the slippery floors though if they are wet!), the gardens delightful and the array of pools such a treat!  Particularly enjoyed the large slide and hot and cold Jacuzzi pools.  The beach is lovely and not crowded.  The restaurants were all great.  The few things which prevent me from giving this property 5 stars: * The pancake machine at breakfast - I have a child who loves pancakes.  Sometimes we waited so long to get the attention of a staff member to cook the pancakes that I wanted to do it myself.  The main breakfast restaurant (the one where you feed the fish and squirrels at the front) seriously needs a person constantly stationed there cooking pancakes.  There's a person stationed…"
5,"When you are in Bali u think u are in heaven And If u stay in Grand Hyatt u would feel that u are living in the best neighborhood of heaven!  Pools, Lobby , Dinning room , spa , rooms everything are perfect in this hotel if u stay there u would enjoy as much as u want let alone staying for your Honeymoon "

4,"I felt Grand Hyatt Bali was a pleasant stay. Rustic feel, sprawling compound, lush greenery, wildlife, attentive and friendly staff.  I feel it could do with some refurbishment and fresh coat of paint, but retaining its character.  I still feel this hotel has a lot of potential to be a choice of stay among travelers."
4,"We booked a 10 day Luxury Escape Package with two other couples, ours was the VIP top package, but we did't have the room to match. All our rooms were tired & needed a complete makeover, On arrival, the floor of our room was very dirty, so I asked to have it cleaned. They are also working on the area, where our room is located, so an afternoon siesta was not possible, with the noise level. On a very positive note, the exterior & surrounds of this hotel are jaw dropping, magnificent, with an incredible River Pool, plus great restaurants, especially Salsa Verde. The service is mostly very good & I'm sure the upgraded rooms would help make it a fantastic & very relaxing holiday in Bali, however this was not our case, with our appointed room."
5,"We have just stayed for 8 days at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua and although expensive it was definately money well spent. This hotel is truly amazing in everyway starting with the buffet breakfast - choose the beach restuarant for amazing beach view or the cafe in the centre of the hotel with magnificant garden view... your cappuccino or in my case soy latte bought to you on arrival (staff are just brilliant and so friendly) or request a take away coffee as we did on a few occasions if we were going out on tours for the day... rooms are massive and great, we are a family of four and had no problems with all of us together, close to Bali collection which is massive bonus we  ate there often and the Kriya Day spa is out of this world. fully recommend this luxurious hotel"
5,We stayed here with the Luxury Escapes deal and this place is 5 star. The standard room is very large with a huge bed and daybed which comes out into a double bed if needed. They also provided a babycot and baby bath with Johnson's baby products which was a nice touch. The grounds are manicured to perfection and the huge lagoon style pool and water slide was great fun for our family.  All the meals we ate at the restaurants were superb.  The Kriya spa massages we had were so relaxing and I would recommended anyone to have one just once. From the moment we checked in I could not fault the service. Everyone is so friendly and happy to help. I would definitely stay at Grand Hyatt Bali again. 
5,"We have just returned from Bali after spending 8 nights at the Grand Hyatt. I can honestly say I could not find a fault with this resort.  The staff are friendly and go out of their way to make sure that you have a wonderful holiday. Nothing is too much trouble.  The rooms are spacious, modern and immaculate. The grounds are huge with sweeping lawns, gardens and ponds.  My granddaughter loved feeding the fish and the squirrels. The pools are lovely and their is a waterslide that makes for great fun. Food at the restaurants on site is absolutely delicious. There is also numerous restaurants and shops at Bali Collection shopping Centre which is a short 5 minute stroll away. If you are looking for a place to unwind and relax then this is the place!"

5,"As a Hyatt Diamond member, I’ve stayed at many Hyatt’s all over the world. Grand Hyatt’s, Park Hyatt’s, Hyatt Regency’s, Andaz, etc. The Grand Hyatt Bali certainly met and in many cases exceeded my expectations when staying at a Grand Hyatt property.  If there’s one thing that just about every review on Tripadvisor agrees on is that the grounds of the Grand Hyatt Bali are beautiful. Pathways lead you around the property past koi ponds, lush, beautifully maintained grounds, numerous swimming pools, and down to the beach, several restaurants and to your room.  We were upgraded to a King suite on the second floor directly across from the Grand Club. If you don’t have Diamond status with Hyatt you can still access the Club by booking a room with club privileges. In some cases the…"
5,"Stayed in Late April/early May 2015 with our 2 childern aged 7 and 9. Loved the hotel, fantastic location, lovely grounds and facilities, good food and super friendly staff at all times. Room was ample space for whole family and very nice. Would love to come back soon"
4,"Our first time to the well acclaimed part of Bali, Nusa Dua. Having to past through security gates to enter Nusa Dua and also the Grand Hyatt settled the nerves of my wife as it made us feel very safe and secure. A grand entrance and huge hotel. So many paths and bridges it's a bit confusing the first day but you soon get use to it.  The pool is fantastic and the large water slide is great fun for the kids and adults. There is plenty of seating and shady areas around the whole pool so no need to rush and grab a seat each morning. Want a quite seclude pool, they have a couple of those as well. A couple things to note, there is no lifeguards on duty and if you sit at the water slide end it is a long way to the nearest toilet.  The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. We had a…"
5,"Purchased a Luxury Escapes voucher and overall had a wonderful experience. Had to wait for our room, which was a bit annoying as we arrived after 3pm. However, the free meals, great service and beautiful grounds made up for it. Would go again if another special offer comes up. "
3,"stayed 4nights in the suite. room is big and clean with seaview. hotel is just next to the beach. it has large swimming pool, with 2 slides, 1 at the adult pool and 1 at the kids pool. Kids pool slide is longer and even the adults love it.  5-10mins walk is the shopping place with lotsa shops and restaurant. Other than that, it is not so convenient, will have to take a car to get out.  As per my header, this is a big property, from lobby to the room might be a distance walk, depends on the block.  Within the hotel, there are few shops, a convenient store, money changer."

Pathways lead you around the property past koi ponds, lush, beautifully maintained grounds, numerous swimming pools, and down to the beach, several restaurants and to your room.  We were upgraded to a King suite on the second floor directly across from the Grand Club. If you don’t have Diamond status with Hyatt you can still access the Club by booking a room with club privileges. In some cases the…"
5,"Stayed in Late April/early May 2015 with our 2 childern aged 7 and 9. Loved the hotel, fantastic location, lovely grounds and facilities, good food and super friendly staff at all times. Room was ample space for whole family and very nice. Would love to come back soon"
4,"Our first time to the well acclaimed part of Bali, Nusa Dua. Having to past through security gates to enter Nusa Dua and also the Grand Hyatt settled the nerves of my wife as it made us feel very safe and secure. A grand entrance and huge hotel. So many paths and bridges it's a bit confusing the first day but you soon get use to it.  The pool is fantastic and the large water slide is great fun for the kids and adults. There is plenty of seating and shady areas around the whole pool so no need to rush and grab a seat each morning. Want a quite seclude pool, they have a couple of those as well. A couple things to note, there is no lifeguards on duty and if you sit at the water slide end it is a long way to the nearest toilet.  The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. We had a…"
5,"Purchased a Luxury Escapes voucher and overall had a wonderful experience. Had to wait for our room, which was a bit annoying as we arrived after 3pm. However, the free meals, great service and beautiful grounds made up for it. Would go again if another special offer comes up. "
3,"stayed 4nights in the suite. room is big and clean with seaview. hotel is just next to the beach. it has large swimming pool, with 2 slides, 1 at the adult pool and 1 at the kids pool. Kids pool slide is longer and even the adults love it.  5-10mins walk is the shopping place with lotsa shops and restaurant. Other than that, it is not so convenient, will have to take a car to get out.  As per my header, this is a big property, from lobby to the room might be a distance walk, depends on the block.  Within the hotel, there are few shops, a convenient store, money changer."
4,"We really enjoyed our time at the Grand Hyatt, facilities are amazing although not much to do around Nusa Dua. A perfect hotel for honeymooners. Quite expensive inside the resort. Very quiet when we visited in March. Literally walk out from the resort onto the beach... Although nothing special. Spent most our time at the resort pools."
5,"The beach is one of the best in Nusa Dua area, clean and exclusive, low trees serve as natural umbrellas over the sunbed chairs and squirrels stare at you from above, fantastic beach for family. The connected pools are quite big, an expedition trip with the kids adds fun, and the tasty Italian restaurant perfects the day. The rooms are large and well maintained, and daybed is very practical for families with children. Bali Collection, an arcade with many restaurants and shops, is a 5 minute walk, just across the street from hotel gate. Definitely recommended for a family holiday, especially with young children."
4,"Large resort situated on beach. great location although can get a little windy in September. Many pools, lots of outdoor activities and many restaurant choices. The Japanese tepinyaki is excellent for dinner. Our breakfast was included so we had a choice of restaurants to eat at. I would recommend the club rooms as the pool is quiet and seating area at restaurant is situated around the ponds with large koi to feed. Evening drinks and canapes excellent."
4,"Located amongst multiple 5 star hotels in the nusa dua region, Grand Hyatt Bali can simply be described as luxury at its simplest best. I went there with a friend almost 6 years ago and i still remember the serene lobby overlooking the ocean on one side and a pool of water with beautiful candles floating in it. We stayed at the club level rooms and i have to admit for someone who loves fruits and everything fresh, you are in heaven. Through the day access to the club lounge lets you soak in to an unlimited supply of fresh juices and fruits with basic savory snacks.   The rooms are clean and recommend to choose the side that overlooks the Balinese pool. Its much quieter since not too many guests come on this side and you can have a relaxing stay experience if you plan to do…"
5,A piece of paradise in Bali. Beautiful landscaped gardens and pools to lose yourself in with plenty of activities for the children. Staff were genuinely friendly and helpful when needed. Food and service of the highest standard. Will return.

4,This hotel is specially great for kids.  Though I have been here with and without children. The water slide is a highlight for the kids while the spa was the highlight for the adults.  Lots of restaurants to choose from and right across from the Bali Collection where there are more restaurants at lower cost.
5,"We had a super time at the Grand Hyatt Bali . You can literally spend your entire time at this resort without wanting to step out. We began each morning with squash at the Bay Club following by days at the pool, with the excellent service of the Pool Bar (Pari's our guy!). The staff is extremely friendly. You also have the option of the walking/running track around the Tip of the island outside of the property. The beach is right next door and on high tide, the water is clean enough for a swim. We were booked into the Club room with a sea view. The room was extremely spacious and looked better than in the pictures.  In case you are keen to step out , there is a strip of shops and restaurants right outside the property worth exploring."
4,Had 10 days here.  Beach is very good - clean and wide.  Long morning walks.  Hotel is large and takes a bit of getting used to.  Rooms are all really comfortable and of good size.  There are quite a number of restaurants to choose from but I have to say the food is not all that impressive.  The Italian restaurant should be given a very wide birth.  By far the best restaurant is the Japanese. For the second half of my stay with my 12 year old daughter we had a Club room.  The benefits of being able to use the Club facilities were really worth while.  I think that we probably saved money as a result.
5,We have stayed at the Hyatt three times now. We always stay as Club Guests and the staff always welcome us back and remember us. The staff in the Club area are so friendly and helpful and very sweet to our little girl. The chef who cooks the beautiful food for happy hour is very talented and also very friendly. The grounds are always clean and the pools are lovely. Bar and restaurant food is expensive for Bali so we generally eat at Bali Connection. Only fault we have is my husband's mobile phone was stolen from his bag in the lobby after check out. We have emailed and phoned the hotel manager but they have not bothered to respond. 
5,"Stayed at this amazing resort in October 2014 for 10 days. The hotel is like an island, it's huge. Hosts a variety of shops.  They have their own Ralph Lauren on site! Never got bored.  They have 3 different shares in their grounds for breakfast and over 5 different restaurants with different cuisines. The hotel staff are very helpful and welcoming. They come round twice a day to change towels and offer free bottled water.  Swimming pool and pool side bar is beautiful all staff were great  Would definitely go again."

5,"This resort is absolutely gorgeous.  We were upgraded to a suite that is larger than our apartment... Do not know for sure but I think this thing has got to be 1,000 sq feet.  And it is not just the room that is impressive, the grounds a beautiful and quite large.  I did get lost a couple times. Even with it being so large, and we heard that were almost at capacity, I feel like we are the only ones here.    Tip - get a Club Room.  Complimentary snacks a drinks at night and access to the Club Pool.   I spent two days at the pool and could not have run in to more than 10 people.  Just amazing.  Nusa Dua def lives up to the hype and I cannot wait to return.  Oh yes, I almost forgot.  We told them we were celebrating our 5 year wedding anniversary and they brought the most beautiful…"
5,"Hyatt is a true 5 star hotel with immaculate grounds, decadent pools and facilities cannot fault the service and staff. Some notes though pool bar is not a swim up bar (our mistake) is a very relaxed feel no party atmosphere and high prices (none of this makes me lower their rating as they do not pretend to be cheap and the quality is there all the way) do yourself a favour and walk along the beach paths out of the resort there are many treasures such as the bay Bali with beautiful beach, restaurants and bars even a centre with big water slides it is lined with lanterns and has a few market stalls. Bali collection shopping centre is across the road shopping is not 'cheap' but meals are more reasonable as are drinks. Don't forget all prices in the resort do not include the 20%…"
5,"A great Spacious hotel with its own beach. Excellent Hospitality , All staff members are spontaneous in their friendly behaviour. Food is excellent. Lush Garden with small pools around with ducks and fishes.The service is outstanding. The room, pools and beaches are kept immaculately clean and are truly spectacular, The Nasigoreng served in Green Café are great for your taste buds. This place is preferred for families, though a few honeymooners were also there. There is so much to see around!!. We thank the Management and Staff for making our holiday, such a memorable one."
5,"What a place. What a resort! My husband and I are staying 8 nights in paradise. The staff are genuinely caring and considerate. The service is outstanding. The room, pools and beaches are kept immaculately clean and are truly spectacular, the food in the resort itself is very nice. In particular the Nasi goreng and the southern fried chicken (YUM!). The place is perfect for families or honeymooners - there is so much to see and do. The Balinese are such a beautiful people and we were truly impressed with their hospitality. Thank you to the staff and the management for such a memorable holiday! We will be back!!"
5,"I bought 2 Luxury escapes packages for my wife and I, and our Son and his girlfriend...we visited in April/May. The whole experience was above our expectations,..the resort is huge with some of the best kept gardens I have ever seen.  The pride taken by all the staff in this place has to be seen to be believed, they were all so welcoming and nothing was too much trouble.The resort food was very good, we had no complaints whatsoever.   The rooms were large, very clean and well appointed. The whole place has a really calm restful aura about it,...it suited our needs for this trip perfectly."

5,"Huge hotel with beautiful beach, lush garden and different kind of cute animals. You might see some ducks and fish on the pond, squirrels on the tree, lizards, birds while you were having breakfast. We were upgraded to Club Room where we could enjoy privacy, wonderful service and nearer to the beach. We were there for site inspection for incoming Freight Forwarder conference. Hana Mawarti showed us around and introduced every details of the hotel. We were quite impressed by her excellent attitude and professionalism. Overall, Grand Hyatt Bali is a great 5 stars hotel with amazing facilities and wonderful service. One thing that might cut down the stars is room amenities, like shampoo, shower gel, shaving kit, etc, it should belong to 3 stars hotel."
4,"The hotel has beautiful landscaping.  Lots of gardens, koi ponds, many beautiful plants and flowers everywhere you walk on the property.  This is hotel is big, no really big.  If you stay at one of the further ends of the hotel, it can be a long walk to the restaurants, pool and lobby area.  The pool and beach area was incredible.  My kids(5, 7) loved it and didn't want to leave.  They have 2 water slides on the property, small one is about 5 feet long and the big one is over 30 feet if I have to guess.  The long one has couple of turns and it's fun for adults and kids.  The beach is clean compared to other beaches in Bali.  The waves are minimal so it's safe for kids to play in with some supervision of course.  I ate most of my meals at the Garden Cafe.  Their kids menu has…"
4,"The Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua is a very beautiful resort, it is extremely clean and has wonderfully kept gardens.  We had booked a garden Grand club room but got upgraded to a Grand Club sea view room which was a nice surprise. The room was very clean and beautifully kept. I think the extra you pay for the Grand club is very good value for money, We initially thought the breakfast could be improved but then realised you can actually order pretty much anything you like to be freshly cooked for you. The evening drinks and canapés is fantastic, it is pretty much unlimited and the food served is delicious. We stayed here end April which is a quieter time so resort was not too busy which as a couple suited us perfectly. Overall we had a really lovely time here, the only negative is we…"
3,"I wish there was a 3.5 rating but there isn't so I'm giving it a 3 because I can't bring myself to give it a 4.  Good points... the resort is beautiful and the gardens are spectacular, especially considering the extremely reasonable room rates.  The beach is incredible and great for kids, since they can go out so far in shallow water.  The kids also really enjoyed the slides at the resort.  The staff was very sweet and always smiling.  Things to improve... I'm not sure what happened but we woke up one day and the beach was completely covered in trash.  I'm talking about old Vaseline jars, used toothbrushes, old shoes...you literally couldn't walk on the beach without stepping on someone's old trash. It was really disgusting.  While I realize the resort probably had nothing to do…"
5,This resort offers so much. The feeling of water being everywhere was very relaxing as soon as you entered the property. Beautful waterlilies and the typical Balinese pavillions add to the calm and luxurious feel. All the restaurants were off the best quality and there is a great choice of food types. The spa was magical. The staff  were all helpful and friendly and spoke English very well. maybe the drinks prices were a little high but there were many happy hours at different bars.

The best thing was the staff at the Grand Club - particularly Mr. Urip, Miss Justine, Mr Adi and all the wonderful ladies that took such good care of us.  Thanks to all of you.  The next best thing was the grounds and natural surroundings - they are stunning, immense and very relaxing (which is what we needed).  It has a good beach and the swimming pools are quite artistic.

3,"Nice beach side property with low standard staff service. Not at all up to the standard of Hyatt. You will fell like lost after check in and will have to manage everything by your own. Their reception or operator number is mostly busy.. so u need to wait for almost every room service. Room with mosquito and moth.   We stayed here for 4 nights with family and found only one reason to be here i.e. beach and pool, which you can find in any other decent resort in bali."
4,"We spent two weeks at the Grand Hyatt and had a superb time. The staff is very welcoming and helpful, especially women. Traveling with three kids, you come to appreciate the immediate help getting in and out of the taxi, carrying bags, assisting at the breakfast, pool etc. The room service is quick, the room cleanness is perfect. The rooms themselves are spacious and comfortable, we always had a nice view on the pool or a pond. The buffet breakfast is very good, the variety of dishes is large, everything is very fresh. The restaurants are not worth eating at though. The prices are high and you can get better prepared dishes elsewhere. The Italian restaurant is ridiculous, the menu is written with many mistakes in it. The chef is not Italian and this explains the low quality and…"

5,"Great experience of so much landscaped greenery beside a beach. Great comfortable rooms with wooden deocor. Helpful and reasonable travel desk to book vehicles to Mt Batur Volcano and other parts of Bali like Uluwatu and Tanhalot. If you want to stay in a 5 star property in Bali, this is a great option for serenity and peace. But please keep a map of the property as there are different wings of this huge sprawling property and you tend to loose way within the campus to reach reception area"
5,"It may not be the cheapest accommodation in Bali but it is worth every penny. We have great facilities with great staff looking after us 24/7. The beach out the front of the resort is excellent and well shaded with lush trees for those that wish to read or sleep under them. Resort staff wander around here and the 4 pools to ensure you are well watered and fed. The restaurants are all excellent, our pick would be the Balinese buffet they serve outdoors every night that includes a show. This place if family friendly as well as secluded enough for couples. We have really relaxed and enjoyed our stay, disappointed to be traveling home tonight."
4,"We stayed here for a weeks stay, the gardens and pool areas are beautiful and well cared for?  The beach is clean and the sea can be choppy! The hotel is on a large scale and our room was a good distance from the entrance so this could be difficult if walking is an issue for you! Nusa Dusa is a tourist district and you have to get a taxi if you want to visit the local towns!  The hotel food and drinks are expensive and I would recommend eating in the restaurants just outside in the shopping mail called the Bali collection! We had a lovely stay here but experienced an issue with a missing item from our room which the management replaced! Breakfast was nice and the staff pleasant. Whilst staying here they did hold an event near our room which was noisy but the hotel did leave us a…"
3,"Great facility, which current management has trouble running successfully. Hyatt benefits from fantastic location and convenience, as well as the grand tradition of Asian luxury. However, those in charge are not sufficiently meticulous and the resulting lapses make it hard for customers to justify the price premium they charge. One of many examples: the Japanese restaurant used to offer amazing meals when I stayed there two years ago. This time the food was mediocre. Perhaps the Russians that used to frequent the place couldn't tell the difference, but management should not presume all their customers are as thick."
4,"For a week in March we were relaxing at the Grand Hyatt. An older hotel, still lovely, well appointed and the location in Nusa Dua is good. Very close to the Bali Collection Shopping Centre so you can easily replenish the T for your duty free G. The beach is clean and safe for swimming. The gardens are expansive and beautiful, you can always find a quiet spot to relax. Five or so bars and restaurants in the resort means that it is not necessary to venture too far outside for food if you don't want to. But, as is the case in a lot of the resorts in Bali, it's the staff that really impress. Helpful, polite, friendly and professional meant that our room was always immaculate, the service in the restaurants was superb and the pools are kept clean. The club lounge is peaceful and…"
5,"Great experience of so much landscaped greenery beside a beach. Great comfortable rooms with wooden deocor. Helpful and reasonable travel desk to book vehicles to Mt Batur Volcano and other parts of Bali like Uluwatu and Tanhalot. If you want to stay in a 5 star property in Bali, this is a great option for serenity and peace. But please keep a map of the property as there are different wings of this huge sprawling property and you tend to loose way within the campus to reach reception area"
5,"It may not be the cheapest accommodation in Bali but it is worth every penny. We have great facilities with great staff looking after us 24/7. The beach out the front of the resort is excellent and well shaded with lush trees for those that wish to read or sleep under them. Resort staff wander around here and the 4 pools to ensure you are well watered and fed. The restaurants are all excellent, our pick would be the Balinese buffet they serve outdoors every night that includes a show. This place if family friendly as well as secluded enough for couples. We have really relaxed and enjoyed our stay, disappointed to be traveling home tonight."
4,"We stayed here for a weeks stay, the gardens and pool areas are beautiful and well cared for?  The beach is clean and the sea can be choppy! The hotel is on a large scale and our room was a good distance from the entrance so this could be difficult if walking is an issue for you! Nusa Dusa is a tourist district and you have to get a taxi if you want to visit the local towns!  The hotel food and drinks are expensive and I would recommend eating in the restaurants just outside in the shopping mail called the Bali collection! We had a lovely stay here but experienced an issue with a missing item from our room which the management replaced! Breakfast was nice and the staff pleasant. Whilst staying here they did hold an event near our room which was noisy but the hotel did leave us a…"

5,"I appreciate the management of Grand HYATT Bali Hotel for professionally understanding the expectations of the tourists and visitors of this lovely city and to provide the exceptional atmosphere and environment for their guests to feel better the Bali, as a nice and not forgotten place."
3,Beautiful hotel with excellent service staff.  Some issues with being family friendly.  Room allocation an issue and noise from neighbouring rooms could be rectified with better room allocation and placement of families.  getting older and noise issues a definite problem.  Beach - magnificent.  a Hotel with lots of opportunity but losing sight of current travellers expectations.
2,Spent 4nights in suite room with 2 kids and wife. Found a lot of ants in the sofa bed where our kids were supposed to sleep but couldn't. Asked for disinfection and a guy came and did it but didn't work well. Found some miscommunication between staff so understood once but happened again so I had to waste my morning time dealing with it. Front desk manager apologized and tried very hard to solve the problem but it was too late. Bali is a perfect place for holiday but I don't think I would stay again at Hyatt Bali
5,"This is my second visit to the Grand Hyatt Bali (my first was way back in 2009) and the grounds look as beautiful and well-kept as ever! Although the hotel is quite full, you don't really see crowds anywhere except for during the breakfast buffet. The room is perfect and is really very reasonably priced for the quality. The hotel is conveniently located just across the road from Bali Collection, where you can go for shopping for food.  I must mention the sales executive, Hana Mawarti, who really made us feel welcome. She tried to accede to our requests and is always professional, yet sincere. Thanks, Hana, for the hospitality you have shown us."
5,"Stayed 4 nights at the Grand Hyatt Bali. The resort is very large, with direct access to the beach. The beach is very clean, and at low tide, the water is crystal clear and you can see right to the bottom. Definitely much, much nicer than the beaches at Kuta and Seminyak. Lots of beach activities offered, including snorkelling and surfing lessons. The surfing instructor gave me a 1.5h lesson (even though I only paid for 1h) as the waves were a lot better towards the end of my lesson.  The rooms are very spacious and very clean. Many good dining options within the resort. Very kid friendly. Would stay again."

5,"The entrance with the Ganesha idol, the walkway to the lobby which opens up to the sea, the bougainvilleas and the trees.......this resort makes you fall in love with it. The most beautiful property I have ever stayed at till date. This property need a book and not a page to describe it, the veg-club sandwich (with the pickle and sauces) cannot escape our memory. Excellent service and staff."
5,i can't speak highly enough about this hotel.  The staff were fabulous and very helpful.  The room in the north wing near the Balinese Emerald pool was wonderful.  Initially it seems a bit of a walk to reception but after a day it seems like nothing!  Pools were spotlessly clean and breakfasts just incredible.  Had a Luxury Escapes package which was excellent - will definitely visit other Grand Hyatts if we can.  Good old fashioned service and quality in all aspects.  The Luxury Escapes package was organised extremely well.
4,We stayed here for 10 days and it is such a beautiful location. The staff were friendly and the room were spacious. This grounds are very spacious so it doesn't feel like you are staying in a hotel. Lots of different food to choose from for breakfast. Kids love the pool and the beach. Would definitely come back again.
4,"In comparison with other Hotels/Resorts, adding the competitive pricing, it can recommed 100% the Grand Hyatt.  Don't have any expectations about the breakfast, but neverthelessa great location & high standard service"
2,Please review rooms and stay before staying here as they are very outdated and not always clean. Eating in the resort is very expensive for Bali and also double check your bill when you checkout as we found overcharges. Kids club we felt was not safe due to not gate on the front and kids and other guests can walk in and out at any time and this is located near a common path and also the beach and pool. Staff are friendly but hotel is well overdue for a renovation.

5,"We travelled to the grand Hyatt in early April. Excellent facilities, staff, meals, location. We booked a luxury escape package and the additional coupons were such good value. It was a great experience. The staff couldn't do enough for you (contrast with the Mulia resorted we visited to scope out maybe staying there the next time we go to Nusa Dua -- that place was like waling through a high security prison; we got tailed by multiple security guards with walkie talkies who were trying to ensure that ""riff raff"" like us did not invade the exclusive villa part of the resort; very different from the vibe we had at the Hyatt). Anyway, beach was good, Gym, sauna, not and cold spas area was great. Probably the best experience we've had at a resort/hotel in over a dozen holidays we've…"
5,"First off all I would like to a special thanks to the front staff up on our arrival  we stayed at resort for one night as we where waiting for our flight the next day. this  nice resort is located right next door to Bali shopping full of bargains night life and cheap  massage  and restaurants  this hotel has something to do  for  everyone very nice night market inside the resort  very friendly staff and good size rooms , will defiantly return return again   thank you to all the staff"
4,"Me and wife stayed at Grand Hyatt  for 3 Nights during last week of March 2015 on occasion of my 50th Birthday The resort itself is huge, very beautiful and the  beach is right next to the pools. The pools are very good and the beach is very clear and pristine We had booked the ocean facing room and the ocean views are spectacular but please note that for having the same you have to take rooms on the 4th or 5th Floors and insist on full ocean facing rooms. Their  2nd floor is lobby level and 1st floor is pool level from where the views are not good, so if you are paying extra for the ocean facing room you should ensure room on 4th or 5th floor only They have 3 restaurants where buffet breakfast is served ( the menu is same for all 3) only the location of restaurants is…"
3,We did not get any welcoming gesture for our special stay at the hotel. Room was stale and smelled. The smell was discomforting which lead to us being unable to stay in our room. The pool facilities were nice but the water temperature was too hot. The pricing of menus was expensive for what we received. The staff were pleasant and friendly and did their best. The poolside bar was a nice place to have a drink and relax.
5,"Not usually a resort person, but as our children are getting older now (5 + 7) we needed more facilities and space.  The resort over delivered in all aspects, facilities were fantastic, Pool, Beach, Restaurants, Gym, Spa and overall location far exceeded our expectations.  Children were happy with the club and the main pool(with slide) but there were lots of Adult only spaces for quiet time - the fitness center area especially had a wonderful peaceful ambiance with private pool surrounded by day bed pavilions - great place to relax after a work out"

It is convenient that shopping mall is walking distance if you want to go out with families.  For familiy, it is nice place and doing nothing and relax."
4,"Beautiful landscape and area, excellent service, great value package deal. Needs to improve luxury quality items. Caters mostly to Asian not westerners . Beach is clean and well maintained, great walking distance to other nusa dua resorts and restaurants"
4,"Myself and partner stayed here on a Luxury Escapes package for 8 nights over Easter, We were pleasantly surprised and completely satisfied. Our ground floor room was spacious with everything you need. Great quiet aircon, very comfortable bed, and large bathroom with walk in robe and sep toilet. Sit out area with a view to the beach.   And what a beach. Private, with white sand, clean water, must stretch for 1 kilometre all for Hyatt guests only. Shade provided but numerous lovely trees growing in the sand. The sand is raked and vacuumed daily. Water very clear. Plenty of sun beds and spots to get away from others if you want to. There are a few approved beach vendors who are not bothersome at all. If you prefer to swim in a pool, then there are endless choices, which are all…"
4,"We went away for the weekend, great location, older hotel showing its age.  If you can pay a little extra for club lounge it makes the stay so much more enjoyable- great staff, thank you.  Unfortunately our room was in the middle of a tour group which work us up late at night and early in the morning - a little more thought with the placement of our room should have occurred.  I would change the in room coffee and the pillows - thank you"
3,"Rooms are still the same as they were back in 2003 when we first stayed there, need a bit of modernisation, staff are what makes this place they simply can't do enough to to help. Location is great,  close to Bali collection only a 5 minute walk. Beach is pristine and very clean, a lot for the kids to do during the day and if they get board then ther e is camp nusa great prices and very friendly staff with a beat daily programme."

5,Overall the hotel was excellent my only complaint is the 6 hour delay in obtaining our room even though we booked it 6 months ahead apart from that annoyance the resort was faultless. Would recommend it to any one.
4,"We had a family reunion here last year. This place has a huge territory, big bool and several places to eat. Close to Bali collection, short walking distance to the village. Nothing extraordinary, but quite good. Would recommend for families with elderly people, but not for couples."
5,We spent a wonderful week at the Grand Hyatt Bali. The highlight was definitely our 10th anniversary of our marriage and the romantic dinner at the beach ( moon shine included!) . Everything was very well organised by the staff of the hotel. The white sand beach and the garden landscaping at the Grand Hyatt Bali are outstanding. However the rooms need a renovation soon. We enjoyed our time at the Grand Hyatt Bali mainly because of the very friendly and dedicated staff . We definitely will come back!
5,"We had some reservations about this hotel due to some negative reviews. It is a large property with more than 600 rooms divided into 4 blocks. IIt was a distance from the room to the beach but hey, who cares. It's good exceeding and the gardens are amazing so who cares. We stayed ther 6 nights. Initially we stayed in a room that had an interconnection and it was a bit loud. We could here our neighbours on the phone etc. you could see that the room is old and there were a few things that were not working. We asked for a different room. It was in a different block and close to the Balinese pool and it looked as if it was renovated. Bed was very comfortable. Bath tub and rain shower in room.  Typical Hyatt room.  The kids loved the pool and the slide. Amazing beach. I would say…"
5,"A friend saw this great deal through luxury escapes so we booked at the end of last year. WOW what a holiday !!! We had meals included at Nampu Japanese restaurant👍, a buffet meal and a Balinese Cultural Show a meal at the Italian Salsa Verde 😋. Breakfast every morning at The Garden Cafe massages, spa treatments, brunches & the list goes on. Even did Yoga, bike riding, stand up paddle boarding and relaxed by the pool.  Staff are very accommodating, rooms very spacious, our location was perfect. Will definitely come back here. "

4,"We just got back from an 8 night stay at the hotel and overall our feelings were mixed. We have stayed at much less expensive and smaller hotels in Nusa Dua and in many ways received a better experience. The good parts: Great variety of restaurants, great choice of swimming pools and huge space so never need reserve a lounger, great location on the beach, beautiful spa and spa treatments, comfy bed. The bad parts: drinks are SO expensive ($7 for a small beer, $5 for a coke, $5 for a water) and happy hour only includes 4 cocktails. i have never experienced this before - usually beer and wine is included (a hotel 5 mins away offered 50% off all drinks between 3-7pm so we would often go there for an afternoon beer). . the meals at the pool bar also very expensive. the service was…"
4,i have been at the hotel for a 3 days break with my wife.  The location is great as it is in Nusa Dua which is a very well manicured part of Bali.  Great beaches and a nice paved path by the beach going through all the resorts. It is ideal for a morning jog or an evening walk. The resort is very big and well maintained with great facilities. We had a lovely suite unfortunately with no view. We went for the club and it is very convenient as you have a very nice happy hour from 5 to 7 pm where they serve food. After that you do not really need dinner.  The SPA is very big even if I found it a little too expensive.  As a couple we would have preferred a little more privacy. I feel the resort is excellent for families with kids and big groups. For a romantic escapade I would choose…
5,Stayed here from March 25th to April 1st ...the hotel grew on us as we stayed and it was a fantastic experience all in all...The rooms were clean and very quiet ...the breakfast at Salsa Verde was excellent ..the swimming pool had clear blue welcoming waters and its a treat to spend time there specially as the summers were setting in....The beach is attached to the Hotel property and is a very wide clean beach not crowded ideal for families ...The hotel has some very good restaurants and would recommend trying out all before stepping outside for a meal...this is definitely the hotel I'm going to stay when I'm in Bali next.
5,"We just stayed at the Grand Hyatt and had an amazing experience. I am on a restricted diet and contacted the hotel in advance to see if they could accommodate my needs. The staff bent over backwards to accommodate me. I met personally with two of the chefs, had staff checking in on me constantly with a huge smile calling me by name and they delivered exactly what I could eat. I can't tell you how happy I was about this. My husband also had a video conference call one evening and the hotel management graciously offered to use an unoccupied room for a few hours which was again, an example of great customer service.      We have two boys, 8 and 4 who enjoyed the kids club most days. We felt very comfortable leaving them there and they had the time of their lives meeting new…"
3,"Was at the hotel for a conference. Spent most of my time shuttling between my room in east village and the hotel ballroom. The room was large and spacious but had a bit musty smell. Breakfast was challenging as there are limited seats at the breakfast area in east village. I was left with the option to sit in the sun. I had the unfortunate experience of my room key being de-activated as I asked for a later check out time to enable me to attend the last session at the conference. After the long walk to my room, found the key not working. There was no option to call front desk to send a new key as I could not enter my room. The hotel management needs to solve this issue as it's a 10 min walk to get to the main lobby reception to get a new key. This is fine if you're not in a hurry…"

3,"Was at the hotel for a conference. Spent most of my time shuttling between my room in east village and the hotel ballroom. The room was large and spacious but had a bit musty smell. Breakfast was challenging as there are limited seats at the breakfast area in east village. I was left with the option to sit in the sun. I had the unfortunate experience of my room key being de-activated as I asked for a later check out time to enable me to attend the last session at the conference. After the long walk to my room, found the key not working. There was no option to call front desk to send a new key as I could not enter my room. The hotel management needs to solve this issue as it's a 10 min walk to get to the main lobby reception to get a new key. This is fine if you're not in a hurry…"
5,This is one of the extra ordinary and beautiful hotels i have ever seen in my life. Unbelievable design of hotel makes you feel a real boss. Servants treat you best way which never find in Europe or US. Very clean beach with full welfare facilities right in back yard. Swimming pool is so clean.
3,"Visiting as a family of four. The room is a little dated but still acceptable. However it was not cleaned properly. Layers of dust and cobwebs in many areas. But the biggest issue is water quality. On running a bath the water is filthy brown. Also from the tap in the basin. Have spoken to the manager, let's hope they can resolve the situation and save our holiday.  The pools are lovely and the beach very nice. Not quite Maldives but still good.  I think as a large slightly older property they will need to be careful to not let standards slip."
5,The hotel provided me with a spacious room with sea view. The room very was very clean and had a balcony with two chairs. The hotel has many options for dining including a bar close to the swimming pool.
3,"The Grand Hyatt at Nusa Dua Bali is reminiscent of Old Asia. The lush tropical gardens ,stretch of magnificent beach front and the low rise Balinese buildings and the use of Authentic Balinese arts and furnitures effect the Bali Hai of ""The South Pacific""... the exotic paradise. The dining places are all spectacular both ambiance and food.  It is the room that disappoints. The Ocean View King room where we stayed is not so clean and bathroom needed serious scrubbing,something you do not expect from  5 star hotel. Other than that it is"" Bali Hai....The exotic paradise."
4,"Stayed here 3 nights at beginning of March.  Pluses:  - Upgraded to ocean view room - Service was efficient and friendly all around  - Room was large, clean and comfortable and close to beach, breakfast and reception - comfortable surroundings and not many people - the restaurant near reception (to the right was very good and cost reasonable. - breakfast quality and selection was ok. Not great but not bad either  Cons: - tried the Balinese buffet. Selection was good but most of the food was stone cold and it was about 8-900 HKD for 2 people. Avoid! - for some reason the toiletries weren't refreshed and had to call and ask them to deliver.  Tips: - get a local number for your mobile and get the blue bird taxis or a local driver to pick you up to and from the airport. It's much…"

3,"This is my very late review, but I wanted to share anyway. I first stayed at Grand Hyatt in Bali in 2004 for few days, rooms and services were great. Then I came back in 2014 and stayed there for business trip about a week. To my surprise, the room that I stayed did not change much from my stay 10 years ago!! Wi-fi connection, extremely poor. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. When I called the hotel to complain, they gave me their internet provider number and asked me  to call them instead having them call and fix it for me. Talking about hospitality service!! Also, it took forever to have someone answer your call whenever you call housekeeping or receptions. It's just annoying. As for food, there are three restaurant for breakfast, the variety of the menu was standard…"
4,"We recently stayed here for 3N 4D , being a first time visitors to this ""island of gods"" must say it was delightful!  The room was superb with a garden view in the west village with the typical Hyatt bathtub and a rainfall shower combo. Nicely manicured landscaped gardens with the vernacular Balinese architecture and lovely decors.This particular room was a tad bit away from the beach, but we didn't mind the walk."
4,"Apart from the endless private beach where we could fly a kite and even cycle, the entire property had many gardens, bridges and ponds!  Our rooms had a balcony facing a pond and we could feed the fishes and monitor lizards, it was like Nat Geo set before us....  Breakfast was great with three restaurants to select - each has a different setting and ambience, the spread was generous and quality of food exceptional and a good balance between continental and local goodies!   BALI Collection is just next door but with Hyatt, there are shops, night markets with local vendors selling handicraft at a reasonable price."
5,"Purchchaed this package through Cudo and was delighted to find the hotel was exceptionally luxurious with many generous inclusions. Our room was spacious set amidst lush gardens and well appointed. Breakfast was served in pleasant surroundings overlooking pool and beach, other restaurants good, gym and massages great, the service excellent.  The Bali Colletion complex across the road from the resort had many shops, supermarkets, restaurants and  was very handy and used extensively by  hotel patrons as meals were cheaper especially for families.  The hotel has its own beach which is very clean and well maintained like the rest of the resort. Staff are  very professional and extremely friendly. Great resort."
3,"We stayed at the hotel with our 7 month old baby for 5 days in Nusa Dua. Below are the cons and pros of the hotel:  Pros. 1.Baby Amenity. They had a big baby crib (much bigger than Graco pack n play)which our baby could play and sleep, (and they even had a little pillow and blanket for the crib). Also, they provided a plastic baby tub and a rubber duck, and some Johnson and Johnson lotion/baby oil which we thought were a nice touch. 2. Amazing landscape. We originally got a room on the second floor on the corner, but the AC didn't work so we ended up switching to another room on the ground floor next by the famous fish pond. We could feed the fish every day and watch birds/Huge lizard come by. It was so much fun. Also, it's only a short walk to the beach (though the walk to…"

3,"So I went to stay here for 2 nights near the beach after staying in Kupu Kupu in Ubud with my wife. We loved Kupu Kupu but then we came here. The hotel, grounds and the location were faultless. Everything looked very clean and nice with excellent views of the area and beach. The beach side watersports centre was quite expensive so I would recommend going to another company to do watersports. The room itself was very nice and clean. The restaurant food for breakfast was great. We did not eat there for dinner as there were loads of alternatives just outside the hotel in the local shopping complex called Bali collection which work out to be cheaper. Me and my wife were disappointed by the service we got from the hotel staff. They did not clean our room fully when we asked them too…"

The staff were nice, however, they were not came fast enough when we ask for help wifi in the room and dvd player, we thought it must be because of the room distance (we were in the furthermost of  west village)  every time we spend weekend in a hotel, my children always want to try their kids club, so that they tried the one in Grand Hyatt Bali as well. there was only 1 staff and we came quite late afternoon on the 2nd day as it was raining most of the time.…"
4,"my family went there for 2 nights stay and the hotel was so close to the Bali collection! This area was fantastic, I mean the nusa dua area.  we got our welcome drinks & cool face towels on arrival. the hotel was so big!!! got more than 600 rooms. there were just 2 restautants for breakfast opened nowadays. they offered the same breakfast. Hyatt owns the biggest beach on this side. all the hotels share the nusa dua beach.  the room has a big lounge inside, it is as big as a mini bed.  they got so many squirrels & birds in the garden. but most people should have been lost in this hotel since the layout of the hotel is a little bit complicated.  you just pick up umbrella in the corridor once it starts raining.  but the television lost connection one night suddenly, the whole…"
2,"By moving from a villa in Nusa dusa and continue our vacation in Bali, I had great expectation for Grand hyatt Bali based on others' good review. But despite its beauty, I had some unpleasant experience and some of their staffs are the bummer of my joyful vacation.   We were visiting Bali during end of Feb in quite a big group of family and we were paying for 3 rooms for 2 nights in grand hyatt. But it happened one day that my family members including 3 little kids were left starving in the hotel when I was out to hospital seeking for some medical assistance due to the injury of one of my elderly family. They were not allowed to have lunch in the restaurant by signing the bills while they have no cash and credit card with them. The hotel staff even misled them by saying that we…"
3,Stayed here with my wife and two toddlers at end Feb/March 2015 through a Luxury Escape package. The room we stayed in was one of the newly renovated rooms close to the reception area in North Village. The room easily catered for the four of us and was spotlessly cleaned everyday. The room had a great day bed that was the size of a double bed used by the kids and shortly after been shown to the room after check in we had two house staff sweep through efficiently with toddler wash amenities and putting linens on the day bed. Great housekeeping staff! They even did that before the bell staff could bring the bags to the room! If you can make sure you ask for a higher level room in a newly renovated wing. Level 3 is reception level and is convenient for those with a pram. The rooms…

5,"An exceptional grand hotel resort surrounded by lush grounds and ponds filled with beautiful Koi carps and water lilies. This is the place to stay if you want to be away from the touristy parts of Bali. The hotel is beach fronted and is one of very few with white sands. We had a room on the 4th floor facing the Club pool lined with canopies of Frangipani trees and lush vegetation. We had a lovely driver that picked us up from the airport to the hotel and we continued to use him over for day tours to Seminyak and Ubud which i highly recommend as the only reliable taxi here is Blue Bird Group. The tricky part about this is every other taxi companies are trying to imitate the Blue Bird logo so the only way to differentiate them apart is to look for ""Blue Bird Group"" written along…"
5,"I first visited the Grand Hyatt over 20 years ago, and reading some of the reviews I was a little worried it was not going to live up to my expectations. However I needn't have worried - phew!  We stayed in a club room which meant our 12 year old had a proper almost double sized bed in a nook in our room. We had access to the Grand Club which serves free breakfast (not just croissants) every day. They also serve free tea, coffee and soft drinks all day. Happy hour with nice food from 5-7 every evening too.  The club lounge is beautiful surrounded by a lagoon and the staff are fabulous. A HUGE thank you to Urip who is the manager, always very helpful and cheerful, a big asset to the hotel. I highly recommend booking a club room.  The beach is AMAZING. We hired bikes and cycled…"
3,"I recently visited the Grand Hyatt Bali. The resort is very nice with a beautiful beach. Being a Diamond member has clear advantages with free breakfast and a really nice happy hour.  However, it is suppose to be 5 star resort, but it needs a few improvements. We made dinner reservations and was given the wrong name of the restaurant by the conciege.  When we were leaving the car service was 10 mins late. As a matter of fact another person walked up to get a taxi after we were waiting for our preordered car and their taxi arrived ahead of our car. Also the cost of getting a driver for a day is over 2x from the hotel then having an outside firm handle for you.  I had a driver for 13 hours and it saved me $230 versus having the hotel arrange. Lastly (I know this is minor) the room…"
5,"We just spent a week in this wonderful hotel with our 6 years old daughter.  Room:  spacious, practical, except for missing hooks to hang wet clothes. There were not enough place to put all our clothes, even though there is a wardrobe in the toilet, so we had the three luggages around, but it was ok. The small soap bottles are not practical. Two big ones on the wall would do better. The girls got beaten by mosquitos, but that's a common problem.  Gym: nice, modern. There were not enough interest from customer side to have aerobics. The pool in the gym part is beautiful (no children allowed).  Children: Our daughter usually likes mini-clubs. In this case she had enough after half a day, even though they have a small play ground and activities. But she definitely enjoyed the pool…"

Check-in with a welcome drink & cold hand towel was very nice.  Most every employee was friendly and always smiling.  However, service was very disappointing. It started with the ice machine near our room.  It was not operating for our 3-day stay at the hotel despite reporting it the day we checked-in.  The concierge didn't have any brochures for things to do and see in Bali, in the area or day trips - nothing.  It seemed the reception staff catered to Japanese and Russian guests. The food was mediocure at best.  Very disappointing since its a Grand Hyatt. Food and beverages are expensive.  For example: it cost…"
5,"Wonderful hotel situated on a peninsula our room had an oceanview.  We watched the sunrise in the morning with coffee brought to our room.  There is no coffee maker in the room but there is a kettle and you could have instant coffee.  The coffee that was delivered to our room was incredible! The staff are very gentle, gracious, and most accomodating.  We actually have never met finer people than the Balinese.  We were always greeted with a gentle bow and hands together in a prayer like pose.   Breakfast was included and we could eat in two restaurants offering it.  The Salsa Verde is an open air restaurant right at the beach (not airconditioned) the other was by the lobby if we wanted to have breakfast indoors with air conditioning.  Both restaurants serve breakfast buffet.  …"
5,The Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua is about 20 minutes car ride from airport.  Huge property with 600 plus rooms and suits in 4 villages.  With eight dinning outlets that will satisfy everyone's palate from local Balinese to Japanese cuisines.  Great spa and gym within the compound and 3 swimming pools and 3 tennis courts for the actives one.   Staff are very friendly and helpful but do repeat your request to ensure they understand. Very good and very relaxing stay with Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua
5,"Grand Hyatt is really Grand in all aspects. The premises is huge with north, south, eat and west village. There are three breakfast places: the Salsa Verde (pool/beach side), the Garden Cafe & The WaterCourt; each beautiful and well maintained. The staffs were warm and welcoming and every time we passed someone a smile was ready. We stayed at the ocean front room: 3118. The balcony gives a clear view of the ocean and a clear pond.  The hotel is clean, nice, huge and beautiful with traditional Balinese statues every where.  We were welcomed by refreshing drinks and a cold towel, but what i missed was a welcome with floral lei, which i got in 2011 in Hyatt Bali (Sanur).   The pools are clean. The beach is very close.

3,"The location directly on the beach is fantastic. Great beach with lounges, no umbrellas but there are a lot of trees providing shade. The landscaping is beautiful.  Check-in with a welcome drink & cold hand towel was very nice.  Most every employee was friendly and always smiling.  However, service was very disappointing. It started with the ice machine near our room.  It was not operating for our 3-day stay at the hotel despite reporting it the day we checked-in.  The concierge didn't have any brochures for things to do and see in Bali, in the area or day trips - nothing.  It seemed the reception staff catered to Japanese and Russian guests. The food was mediocure at best.  Very disappointing since its a Grand Hyatt. Food and beverages are expensive.  For example: it cost…"
5,"Wonderful hotel situated on a peninsula our room had an oceanview.  We watched the sunrise in the morning with coffee brought to our room.  There is no coffee maker in the room but there is a kettle and you could have instant coffee.  The coffee that was delivered to our room was incredible! The staff are very gentle, gracious, and most accomodating.  We actually have never met finer people than the Balinese.  We were always greeted with a gentle bow and hands together in a prayer like pose.   Breakfast was included and we could eat in two restaurants offering it.  The Salsa Verde is an open air restaurant right at the beach (not airconditioned) the other was by the lobby if we wanted to have breakfast indoors with air conditioning.  Both restaurants serve breakfast buffet.  …"
5,The Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua is about 20 minutes car ride from airport.  Huge property with 600 plus rooms and suits in 4 villages.  With eight dinning outlets that will satisfy everyone's palate from local Balinese to Japanese cuisines.  Great spa and gym within the compound and 3 swimming pools and 3 tennis courts for the actives one.   Staff are very friendly and helpful but do repeat your request to ensure they understand. Very good and very relaxing stay with Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua
5,"Grand Hyatt is really Grand in all aspects. The premises is huge with north, south, eat and west village. There are three breakfast places: the Salsa Verde (pool/beach side), the Garden Cafe & The WaterCourt; each beautiful and well maintained. The staffs were warm and welcoming and every time we passed someone a smile was ready. We stayed at the ocean front room: 3118. The balcony gives a clear view of the ocean and a clear pond.  The hotel is clean, nice, huge and beautiful with traditional Balinese statues every where.  We were welcomed by refreshing drinks and a cold towel, but what i missed was a welcome with floral lei, which i got in 2011 in Hyatt Bali (Sanur).   The pools are clean. The beach is very close. The lobby is enormous. Wi-fi was free and strong network.  Since…"
5,"Grand Hyatt Bali is undoubtedly one of our family's favourite hotel situated in the luxurious Nusa Dua Resort. The 5-star hotel comes with their own beachfront and the hot and cold plunge is definitely a 'refreshing' experience for both kids and adults!   We were there again in early Jan 2015 and due to the peak holiday season, we did encounter a couple of issues, but were impressed with how they were promptly resolved by one their senior management, Mr. Sudiman. Mr. (Pak) Sudiman was very professional and proactive in handling our issues, definitely above and beyond the standards that we normally get from a 5-star hotel. I have no hesitation in coming back to the resort for many more great family holidays in the future!"
5,"My family and extended family just came back home from a ten night stay, booked through Luxury Escapes in Australia. We have been to Bali MANY times, and stayed in many different resorts, including some of the most exclusive ones. Grand Hyatt should not be compared with the ultra modern or ultra luxury resorts. But for a genuine Bali experience with great value, it is one of the best!  We found the service amazing. We were treated so nicely by everyone. And any little glitch were solved in a heartbeat.  The grounds are huge, but so beautiful. There are many different areas to please everyone. The beach is great too, which is not always the case in Bali. Nice with many different animals around.  We picked to stay in the North Village with direct access to the Balinese Feature…"
5,"This hotel and all of its grounds are awesome!  The rooms are beautifully decorated and spacious.  We were welcomed by very happy, friendly staff with a drink and cooling face towels. We enjoyed all the koi ponds and all the beautiful pools which are plentiful and extremely inviting.   Having the beach so close was also a real plus!  I would wholeheartedly recommend this delightful hotel."
5,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel we received a warm welcome, the staff were so happy and friendly. We were greeted with a welcome drink and cold face towel in the main lobby while waiting for the manager to take us to check in at the club lounge.   As we made our way to the lounge we were informed of different restaurants and activities we could take part in, once we arrived at the club lounge we were greeted with another drink and cold face towel, this was over and above the service we had expected but we appreciated it.  The staff were so helpful and showed us how everything worked in the room.  We had a great lunch at Salsa Verde the staff were helpful and friendly and even gave us a small salad complimentary as there was a small delay in our food as a huge room…"
5,"Because I've read quite a few negative reviews on here about the Grand Hyatt, I thought I'd chip in with some encouragement for this beautiful Hotel.  This review is straight from my heart. As any oldest sibling in the family knows, once ""the baby"" arrives, you're not the star of the family anymore. I've spent 32 years of my life sharing my beloved Mom and Dad with my pretty awesome little brother (don't tell him I said that) so this trip was a once in a lifetime opportunity to have my parents all to myself in a beautiful Hotel and I loved it.  My parents invited me were going to Bali for 4 weeks but invited me to fly out and stay with them on their last week - at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua.  It was - hands down - the BEST holiday I've EVER been on.  From the second the taxi…"

3,"I was quite disappointed and my short stay was much below my expectations.I was asked to pay an additional amount for a sea facing / sea view room but there was hardly any view of the sea from the room allotted.The property is too huge to be managed efficiently.  The room was big no doubt but looked very unimpressive. Bathroom fittings were old and there was a problem with the toilet flush system which created a problem in the late night and could not be rectified properly till I left.Muddy water in the wash basin, shower and the toilet pot!!! . Toiletries were all not up to the standard and looked cheap ones.Toothbrush is really cheap , cheap and cheap.The shampoo also was bad and smelled horrible to say the least.The TV was a tiny one not seen in other hotels these days , not…"
5,"From the moment we woke up on our first morning and looked out across the lily pond and manicured gardens to the ocean vista we knew we'd made a great choice and everything after that only reinforced this opinion.  Perhaps the room decor could use a little updating but it was large and cleaned spotlessly by the staff. The king bed was very comfortable, the air con consistently pleasantly cool ensuring a great night's sleep, large (ground floor) balcony overlooking lily pond, large bathroom with separate small dressing room with shelf space for 2 large suitcases.  Yes the resort is large and its a bit of a stroll to some of the amenities but we had a map, never had a problem finding anything, and it was lovely strolling through the grounds to get where were going. Best of all the…"
5,"Have stayed at Grand Hyatt Bali a couple of times previously but the resort keeps getting better and better. From the luxurious lobby with ocean views to the pristine grounds and gardens, the resort looks better than ever. The thing that most impresses however is the wonderful staff. Nothing is too much trouble for them and they are always smiling and greeting you warmly whenever you pass by. I would recommend spending a few extra dollars for the club facilities. As not only is the room fantastic but it is great to have all the benefits of the club, such as the cocktails and snacks from 5-7pm. Highly recommended for your next Bali holiday."
5,"Stayed for a week in Grand Club. The warm, gracious staff was just terrific and attentive, grounds were lovely & well tended, and the rooms were very clean.  Lovely serene beach, too, though somewhat loud at sunset when groups of Chinese tourists invaded and shouted to each other, unaware of how quiet the rest of the guests were -- this was not the fault of the hotel in any way, but did detract from some peacefulness. The Kriya Spa was beautiful and worth it!  Would love to stay again."
4,"Had to stay here for a conference. A quick 25 min from the airport, this is 1 of the hotels in the Nusa Dua area - Westin, lauguna, st Regis etc. I've stayed in the Laguna, and it's slightly better than this Hyatt  Arrived at the lobby and it's the typical grand Bali look - semi outdoors, koi ponds, gardens etc. Was brought to my room and along the way, I noticed how large the property is. I was thinking there was no easy way to find my way back to the lobby later. More on that later  The room is large, but tired looking. There is a small balcony overlooking the beach. There is the shower which I prefer , but it smells probably due to age and mould. Toiletries are the cheap in-house ones. The shampoo says rosemary and mint, but it smells like industrial goo. The tv is tiny  1…"

3,"Stayed here February 2015 for a business conference.  As other say ... grounds are spacious, rooms are spacious and staff are friendly.  But this is Bali -- you'd be hard pressed to find a property in the 5 star class that didn't fit that description.  Room was large but a little tired.  had a nice nook/daybed area from which to observe the pond, but the mattress looked quite old.  Soaps, toothbrush, and shaving kit present .... but not much to brag about -- about on par with a 3 star hotel.  Breakfast -- standard fare.  for a name brand like Hyatt,there wasn't too much offered that would wow the audience.  had breakfast at the Water Court and while there was some choice, not something I'd come to associate with Hyatt quality.  INternet -- wifi only.  Even though they had a LAN…"
5,"The hotel is very pleased me and my family, good service, nice room, modern balinese hotel, highly recommended to those who prefer tranquil stay. Not so many entertainment around. But still it's easy to find restaurants by shuttle around BTDC area."
5,"There's a sense of grandeur that few of the other hotels in Bali can match -- the grounds, its stretch of beach, the size of the rooms. Day bed was a nice extra. Bathroom still impressive. Service, of course quite good, although it took a long wait to checkin in and to receive welcome drink. You enter the security gate of the Nusa Dua area and then the security gate of the property itself. OK food at the Bali collection just outside the gate."

5,We just returned from 9 nights staying at this hotel and it was perfect. The hotel grounds are beautifully landscaped with lagoons and pools spread around the property that gives it a beautiful tranquil feeling.  The beach is beautiful and clean and a major part of the resort. The food was excellent as was the staff at all of the restaurants. The rooms were large and clean and the Day Spa was amazing. There is even an adult pool for those travelling without children. I would thoroughly recommend this resort to anyone thinking of going to Bali.

2,"Finally i stayed in Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua Bali, after several time i visited Grand Hyatt Bali for congress, dinner, or meeting.  Pre-stayed It's disturbing for waiting someone to pick up the phone. It looks nobody in the reception or reservation. I called the hotel for booking, make comfirmation and request the room. It need useless time for waiting.  Stayed. I arrived in the hotel and got early check-in. It's good.  The important you need to know: 1. I always love the lobby. There's a lot sofa, nice view to the ocean& garden and Fish pool. We can hear the tradisional music from Bali. 2. I chose the room with ocean view in 3405. I think this room have a great view to the ocean.

4,"Grand Hyatt is absolutely stunning, with understated, high-quality styling, a calming clean beachfront, and generous rooms.   Have stayed in Bali a number of times, and I found the location within Nusa Dua to be excellent because it's across the road from Bali Collection shopping centre (reasonable restaurants and shopping - our fave was Aroma's Restaurant).   The beach is gorgeous and it was great to enjoy the sand and ocean with our toddler and then jump in the lagoon pools/waterslides, without any hassle or any hawkers trying to sell things.   I must say the quality of food and drink is excellent - it was just ridiculously expensive for us! A freshly squeezed orange juice by the pool was about $7AUD not to mention the cocktails nudging $20AUD (2-for-1 cocktails during happy…"
4,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay 4.5 stars! The pool area is huge and there are plenty of beds. Pool games and table tennis to keep the kids and teens happy, a lovely CLEAN beach footsteps away. The room was well appointed and large. A big plus was the large daybed that could be converted to an extra bed for a child. The rooms can accommodate a family of 4 allowing traveling families on a budget to stay in this class of hotel. Given we only slept and showered in the room it was a perfect solution. Nusa Dua may not be our favorite area in Bali - it's fairly generic hotel land down there - but given the destruction and pollution on so many of the once beautiful beaches as well as the access issues even reaching them due to thoughtless overdevelopment, it was really great to stay in…"
5,My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in January. The hotel itself is very large with beautiful gardens and pools. The beach is clean with plenty of chairs and shade. We stayed in the ocean view room which was spacious with a lovely bathroom. The only down side is drinks and food are quite expensive for Bali.

Do not eat at Pasang Sengol unless you live spicy food and too pricey. Buffet breakfast was good but also pricey. Cross the street and eat at the Bali Collection. Beach is clean, water clean and warm. Our room was very spacious and we appreciated the bowl of fruit and the free bottled water. Service was great. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely go back. Hyatt Hotels for me always delivers. "
3,"My family stayed here for 4 nights just before Christmas, the hotel has its positives and negatives, and really for a 5 star, expensive resort there shouldn't be any negatives. The staff are super friendly and very helpful and the grounds are beautifully maintained. The pools are nice and expansive, however, they were so warm we didn't want to get in. The private beach is super clean with a nice surf break but the hotel was charging ridiculous hire fees for any surf equipment. The fitness centre was great, but to have to pay hire fees for table tennis, squash and for a push bike, seriously, why not provide these activities free of charge for the guests who pay top dollar to stay. Many of the other nearby five star hotels, have many of these activities and more free of charge. …"
1,"My family (husband and baby) spent 8 nights at the Grand Hyatt at the beginning of January.   On initial impressions the grounds are nice and lovely to walk around. The pools are good and not to crowded and on a whole, the staff were friendly. The Spa is also great.w  They also kindly supplied our baby with a cot, baby bath and baby products. That was where the positives ended!  On our first night I awoke the next morning with my arm covered in small red bites. They were not mosquito bites (I already had a few of them on me). I thought they may have been sandfly bites. The second night before I went to bed I covered myself in insect repellant.

5,"My husband and 2 young children (4 and 2), spent 8 nights at the Grand Hyatt Bali in January. This was one of our most successful family holidays yet. There is so much to love about the Grand Hyatt. As many reviewers have commented, the grounds are beautiful and lush, and the wildlife abundant. There are ponds and streams everywhere, and yet miraculously no mosquitoes. This I'm sure has to do with the thousands of fish which our children delighted in feeding. The sight of herron's then catching and eating fish every morning and evening was wonderful.  We were fortunate to stay in a club suite. Lots of space, traditional balinese style but beautifully appointed and incredibly comfortable beds. We also appreciated the perfect air-conditioning - not noisy, not too blowy, easily…"
2,"We stayed at the Hotel 6 nights in one of their Suites. The suite we got was spacious and we were excited to start our short vacations. The same night some bad smells (drainage) appeared after having showered. We complaint at once, yet nothing really was done. The smell stayed, even after having complained couple of days in a row. After 3 nights we got offered to be moved one floor up yet they could not guarantee that the same problem will not appear there…. We declined.  Other issues:  -	During the first day we thought to use the minibar… completely empty. It was refilled after 2 days only, yet during checkout they claimed we consumed several items which we did not. If you stay there make sure you control the Minibar. After questioning it, the amounts were credited to our…"

2,"We stayed at the Hotel 6 nights in one of their Suites. The suite we got was spacious and we were excited to start our short vacations. The same night some bad smells (drainage) appeared after having showered. We complaint at once, yet nothing really was done. The smell stayed, even after having complained couple of days in a row. After 3 nights we got offered to be moved one floor up yet they could not guarantee that the same problem will not appear there…. We declined.  Other issues:  -	During the first day we thought to use the minibar… completely empty. It was refilled after 2 days only, yet during checkout they claimed we consumed several items which we did not. If you stay there make sure you control the Minibar. After questioning it, the amounts were credited to our…"
5,"We recently stayed at the Hyatt and it was lovely after the hustle and bustle of Seminyak.  The beaches are quite nice and the Hyatt was really relaxing. The only thing we had trouble with was check in.  We had interconnecting rooms and we had to wait a long time for the second one to be ready. The rooms are average size, separate robe area and separate toilet with a bath.  We had a king size bed and there was also a day bed.  Balconies are quite tiny but ample.   Pool is really good and with a waterslide the kids were kept amused for ages. The downside is it is quite expensive to eat.  Probaly double the price from Seminyak.  But for a splurge it is not too bad. I would like to send a special thank you to housekeeping on Thursday night.  Daughter was sick twice at 3 and 4 am…"
5,"We (family 2 adults and 11&8yo) are currently still at the Grant Hyatt Bali and are very impressed. Positives: we felt like we were a royal family living in a palace. Service was very good and it enabled us to have a very needed relaxing break. Our intentions were to stay in a resort only without tours or venturing out. This review is based on ours experience of facilities, restaurants, service and activities within the resort.   Firstly we are well travelled and have stayed at some top notch places around the world. This place ranks highly in our opinion. The communication prior to our travels were great. We were welcomed in the beautiful lobby, with its beautiful water lily filled water garden which gives an instant idea about the resort. The room was good. Comfortable and…"
2,"Rooms are showing signs of aging. Sprawling complex that's catered more for business than leisure travelers. Confusing instructions on breakfast venue for Diamond members leading to a long check-out process due to the need for approval to remove the charges. Mosquitoes prevalent in the club lounge. Lighting from the gates to the lobby was not functional during both times we passed by.  However, the proximity to the clean beach is a plus. and the Japanese restaurant is of decent quality albeit pricey compared to the competition in other similarly ranked hotel."
2,"Grand Hyatt usually has hotels all across the globe, so we assumed, this one would be great too. Sadly, it wasn't. The hotel was really old, and the staff wasn't that great. When we checked in at 3am in the morning, the guy at the desk said he didnt have any key left! That was just weird and random, because how can a hotel be out of keys. We got our keys in the afternoon. It was just a hassle to enter and exit our room constantly. The property is HUGE! So walking from one place to other takes long, and you may even get lost! The food by the poolside, was horrible! They served us hot coconut water, and pasta that literally had no taste. They say Wifi is free, but honestly, it doesn't work everywhere. Our wifi sometimes worked, and sometimes didnt. Also, our AC wasn't working, so…"
5,"Great location, friendly staff, clean beach and rooms couldn't ask for anymore!  Many restaurants, day spa and activities for children.  Shops near by   Your paying 5 star prices cheaper out of the resort but would definitely come back as a great family location "

2,"This was our first visit to this resort, staying for 3 nights in a King Club room last week. For twenty years we have been regular vacation visitors to Bali, staying at Pita Maha in Ubud for culture, the Pan Pacific Nirwana for golf and always at the Bali Hyatt in Sanur, now closed for 2 years for refurbishment, for the superb gardens and the superb Regency Club. However our experience of the Grand Hyatt was very disappointing compared to the Bali Hyatt– the only Grand thing we experienced in the resort was the vast lobby. 	 Our Club room looked tired with dated and scratched furniture, a dirty balcony table, a door to the toilet cubicle which failed to close due to getting stuck on the bathroom floor and a broken shower head which shot off the end of the hose on turning on the…"
5,This property is by far the grandest and does go by its name. Exceptional upkeep of the surroundings and the flora and fauna is must watch.  The hotel offers multi-cuisine restaurants and the breakfast spread was mouth watering. The property is right on the beach and you can also enjoy sun-bathing experience privately.  All in all amazing place and experience to stay.
2,"This is our 7th trip to Bali and we have always stayed at Four Seasons Jimbaran and Sayan. Loved it, but decided to switch to a bigger resort, Grand Hyatt Bali since we are bringing 5 kids, 2 elderly parents and 2 helpers - 11 pax total, during the 2nd week in Dec 2014.  We have stayed at numerous Park Hyatt and Grand Hyatt resorts/ hotels but this one clearly does not live up to the Grand Hyatt standard. While having lunch at Salsa Verde on the second day, we were fighting with the flies for our food constantly. The waiters served the food without any utensils, and we had to ask them 3 times for it. By then, it was at least 10 minutes before the cutlery were delivered and the flies had already feasted on our lunch. There were no napkins for us to cover the food. Worse still, my…"
5,"It was my first visit to Bali and I stayed there for 5 days and i must say everything  was grand at Grand Hyatt.  Huge compound , big swimming pools ,private beach and caring staff !!  it was really an amazing place to stay !!"
4,Spent two nights at this resort. The resort is with beautiful landscape surrounded by ponds filled with lotus flowers. Cozy and large rooms attached with clean bathroom with all the amenities. Free wifi. Pity that I couldn’t spend more time in the resort to use its spa and other facilities as we as a group were travelling out on sightseeing trips most of the time. Highly recommended for holiday makers.

1,"Worse Hyatt ever. Been to 5 in Asia and this one is really putting their reputation to shame. Considering that the resort is 25 years old it was in a good shape. But what I normally like most about the Hyatt is their service & staff. The staff clearly is also working there for 25 years as we felt like a number from their factory. At the checking the lady asked us what were doing before. My husband started talking about the marine safari park, she said ""I just went there with my son"" then she cut my husband off and said ""yes I remember"". Why ask if your not interested? Then the lady twice said ""just one night?""  As if it wasn't good enough. A bad English speaking guy brought us to our rooms (while we were carrying our own baggs). He didn't say much about the park and its…"
5,"My wife and I stayed here for own honeymoon. It was paradise and we could not have stayed at a nicer place. The staff was great! We wanted to go jet skiing and they accommodated us 100% (twice) The best part was the pools. There were so many nice pools, a total of seven that I counted to choose from and very far from a normal pool The coolest thing was after spending a four  days there and an hour before checking out we walked around and found yet another pool! One that we never saw before that  was a traditional Balinese type pool and very spectacular. #best honeymoon ever!!!"
4,"Stayed at Grand Hyatt Bali over Xmas, it was a great stay with our two kids. The resort is huge with very well kept gardens and ponds. Rooms are well equipped with all the amenities one can expect from a 5 star family resort.  The location of the resort is far from almost every attraction. The Bali Collection mall is a five minute walk from the lobby which makes it convenient to go and eat, visit the pharmacy or the supermarket.  The restaurants and in room dining both are effective however lack taste and wow factor in food and is not worth the money.  The Swimming pool layout is very grand, however had some issue with the temperature.  Excellent spa with very well trained and professional staff. All staff are very polite and helpful, they go out of the way to satisfy guests…"
5,"Having seen a couple of reviews about this property not upto the hyatt standards, we were a little skeptical when we arrived BUT from the moment we entered our concerns were gone.At no point did we find a lapse in service or had a feeling that we were not getting our money's worth. Maybe having a sea facing room on the top floor helped as some of the blocks are really  far away from the main building with  not much of a view of anything.  Positives: 1. there is so much to do on the property that you can easily not go out and spend the whole day there. 2. Best views of the sea and excellent beach 3. stellar staff and warm hospitality 4. OUT OF THE WORLD spa-YOU HAVE TO experience their spa which is made on the design of an indonesian water palace. 5. if you are traveling without…"
4,"As a frequent client of Hyatt, have to say that this resort does not get to the standards of the hotel chain while it carries the name and the pricing. If I stop nagging about the label, I may say that the resort itself has - for me - the best location in Nusa Dua and it is also one of the largest in the area. The staff is also very friendly, as all the Balinese in general. Unfortunately I cannot stop nagging about the pricing, that is clearly above all the service-matching competition's prices. I have been many times in this resort, and I would happily return to it this year providing that the value-for-service ratio is reviewed accordingly."

5,"The highlight is the gardens - 40 acres of beautifully designed and immaculately maintained tropical gardens. Apparently planted in 1973, and claimed 50 garden staff. It shows.   The rooms are very good, the staff very good, the pools very good, the many restaurants very good, and the whole experience hard to fault. Although there are apparently 636 rooms, you almost feel that you have the place to yourself. Unless you go to breakfast around 9.00, when you might have to wait for a table. Earlier or later is fine.  A couple of points worth noting. On arrival at the airport you have to pay a US$35 per person visa application fee, and on departures a 200,000 rupiah (about $20 Australian) departure tax. They don't take credit cards, but the visa fee can be accepted in any currency.…"
3,"GH Bali is a resort, huge both in number of guests and its physical size. We had a suite reserved, and check in was done in a suite, that was ready at 1.30pm, when we arrived. As GP Diamond all our breakfasts and evening receptions were done in Club Lounge, which was dissapointing, as it is open space and food choices are limited, with food quality is questionable, as humidity and hot air is surely not the best environment for storing food. Also, service levels in a lounge not up to Hyatt standards; i.e. at one instance we could not get butter for breakfast, as you have to ask for it and it was even then not delivered. Also, Club can get very crowded; as this happens often, staff loses focus and chaos begins. As Club is an open space, it also is unbearably hot and humid place to…"
4,"What a beautifully landscaped & lavish property is this. We were there as a family group (grandkids to grandparents) & there was no limit to the activities we could all enjoy - the lovely beach, great gym, bike riding, swimming pools galore, squash etc. We had interconnecting rooms with free wifi & the staff were most accommodating. The only downside was that prices at the hotel for the restaurants, massages etc were quite steep but this was not a problem as across the street from the hotel is the Bali Collection shopping centre with a huge variety of affordable eating places, manicure/pedicure/massage parlours, shops etc. Of course staying in a large resort hotel like this can isolate you from the Balinese community but it's no trouble to hop in a taxi (metered & cheap) & head…"
5,"this place is wonderful, i got room just beside the tennis court, there also a basketball ring, the pool is awesome and i love the jacuz, the variety of breakfast and the staff is very friendly, the strong wifi, for me the only con is it is a bit difficult to find food that have a reasonable price"
2,"Unfortunately this was the worse Bali experience we ever had. For the past 5 years we are meeting the rest of family members in Bali every Christmas and this year we have decided to stay in grand Hyatt nusa dua. Our 2 1/2 years old toddler was sleeping on my wife's arm when we arrived and no one was greeting us. 2 checkin desks were empty, 1 said they cannot help us since we are not a Hyatt gold member while the 2nd desk said he wasn't ready. We sat for 10 minutes until I complained and a lady came and gave us drinks and asked us to wait again. At the end it took us a good 25 minutes to checked in with a grumpy toddler woken up by the noises. Our room was right at the end (west wing) and the room itself is very old. The amenities is very standard unlike Hyatt and we don't feel…"

5,"I went there with my husband, 2 kids and 1 baby in July 2014 and had such a great stay! The hotel was huge, had 5 different swimming pools to choose from, with a big slide that even adults love to go into, and a private beach. The room was spacious. They have a sofabed that can be converted into a bed for the kids, a separate ""walk in closet"" to stow away my luggages and stroller, and a balcony to dry those wet swimming suits. The service was great, the food was good, overall we had a marvellous time and definitely recommend this hotel to any family with young children!  Plenty of outdoor space to burn those never-ending kids energy! "
5,We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali in early December booking an Oceanview Club room for a week. It was spectacular.  The resort itself is beautiful with lush gardens and waterfalls everywhere. The pools are landscaped into the gardens so they blend in. The rooms also have great views of the ocean. This is something I researched quite a bit and noticed that most resorts are quite far back from the beach with limited ocean views.  Our room was quite large with nice balcony and chairs. There was a larger bathroom area with ample closet space. The shower and bath was on the balcony with large windows and doorway. All in all this gave the room a very tropical feeling. Linens and toiletries were first class. Towels changed twice a day was a nice touch.  As I mentioned we stayed in the…

The garden was also beautifully landscaped."

I really enjoyed lazing on the sun deck, which was appropriately placed around the pool and the beach area.  We will definitely return here for our next Bali trip."
5,"We have been staying at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua every year since 2011. Hyatt maintains its Balinese characters in its architecture, landscape and staff. They provide a daybed, instead of normal couch in their standard room - which for us comes in very handy, as you could ask them to set it as a bed.  When I say all in the package, it really does.  - Beach front - Fantastic customer service  - Beautiful Landscape which becomes a natural habitat for so many gorgeous animals (birds, squirrels, ducks, etc).  - 5 swimming pools. The kids favourite is the River pool where they have 50m waterslide. - Good range of breakfast food - Dont miss the Dinner at Pasar Senggol. The food was Amazing, from seafood to Balinese famous roast pork. Very authentic! *bring mosquito repellent*  The…"
4,"We had our conference there.   But to say this is a business hotel would be injustice to the page.   Wonderful ambience at entrance, amazing rooms and a wonderful beach makes it an ideal retreat.   A must stay with family - and do take ground floor room with balcony facing the water body - worth the stay.   4/5 would be my rating here. "
5,"This hotel went well above the call of duty. We left behind our baby blanket - a Chicago Bears blanket that my parents gave to my baby when he was born. Although it didn't carry a great deal of value, it contained a great deal of sentimental value to my wife. Upon returning home to Florida, my wife realized we left it behind in Bali. I told her it's gone, but she said she'll call the hotel and see if they found it. I told her it was a lost cause. In any event, she emailed the hotel, who put in her contact with the lost and found manager, who corresponded back and forth with my wife and send her a picture of the blanket which they found. The manager arranged to determine the cost to ship it back to us by DSL, had her fill out some forms via email, and within a few days, we got…"
4,"Throughly enjoyed our stay, even though it was the rainy season!  Rooms were clean and very comfortable.  We found the staff; bellmen, concierges, maids, waitstaff, club staff, all amazingly accommodating and friendly.  There are a number of restaurants on the property that were all first class including, the Japanese, Italian and the Cafe.  It is a large resort, so if anyone has mobility challenges, be sure and clarify your room location in advance.  We found the grounds and ocean beach to be quiet beautiful offering enjoyable walks."
5,"Stayed here for 3 nights with friends.  The area is huge (we got lost a few times getting back to our room), with a few pools and easy access to the beach.  The room was pleasant and comfortable.  I really enjoyed lazing on the sun deck, which was appropriately placed around the pool and the beach area.  We will definitely return here for our next Bali trip."
5,"We have been staying at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua every year since 2011. Hyatt maintains its Balinese characters in its architecture, landscape and staff. They provide a daybed, instead of normal couch in their standard room - which for us comes in very handy, as you could ask them to set it as a bed.  When I say all in the package, it really does.  - Beach front - Fantastic customer service  - Beautiful Landscape which becomes a natural habitat for so many gorgeous animals (birds, squirrels, ducks, etc).  - 5 swimming pools. The kids favourite is the River pool where they have 50m waterslide. - Good range of breakfast food - Dont miss the Dinner at Pasar Senggol. The food was Amazing, from seafood to Balinese famous roast pork. Very authentic! *bring mosquito repellent*  The…"
4,"We had our conference there.   But to say this is a business hotel would be injustice to the page.   Wonderful ambience at entrance, amazing rooms and a wonderful beach makes it an ideal retreat.   A must stay with family - and do take ground floor room with balcony facing the water body - worth the stay.   4/5 would be my rating here. "

5,Only spent one day there as we were on a  world cruise but it was one of the best single day experiences we have had and we certainly intend to return for a longer holiday.The staff could not have been more helpful and the quality of food was excellent.lovely designed swimming facilities.
5,"We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights along with our 5 year old son. We took a sea view room which offerred us a fantastic view. The beach was only 5 mins walk from our room.  Pros: - Beautiful resort, large area, you can spend couple of days in the resort without going out - Has a private beach which is wonderful. - Many activities including Childrens were inside the resort - Multiple lake-like swimming pools - Bali collection (a shopping centre) is 5-min walk - Large room with a side bed which was fun - Wonderful staff  Cons: - Housekeeping takes enormous time to respond - There should have been fly-catcher machine in verandah  Finally, while leaving the country, please keep IDR200,000 per person with you as departure tax (IDR40,000nfor domestic) and they don't take credit card."
5,Stayed in grand hyatt bali for 3 nights. ..One of the best thing about this is the location... its right bang in front of bali collection shopping arcade. ... Therefore is so easy just to step out for grabbing  a quick bite or for shopping. .The resort itself is huge.... It would take one day for u just to explore the resort.... The only downside is that the breakfast buffet is a little repetitive..... The pool area is awesome. .And the beach is spectacular. ...quite serene..... Although there is a issue of sea weeds on it. But the hotel staff constantly cleans it. . it is something which is not in the hands of the hotel. ... The hotel has a taxi stand from where u can take the blue metered cab to kuta and other places. .. as we had a flight out of bali late night.. even after…
4,"I think this is an old hotel. But still clean and well maintained. This hotel is huge. You can get lost here :) What impress me most is the gardens and ponds. Beautiful views. This hotel has a private beach also. If you are a ponds and gardens lover, you have to come to this hotel"
5,Excellent facilities and outstanding staff.  A lot of extras such as Massage and free meals.  A lot to do and some interesting places nearby.  Very good value for money and specials available. Need to pick a time that is not too hot.

5,"I stayed here with my husband for 2 nights in October. The resort itself is simply stunning, beautifully kept grounds with plenty of little areas to relax and feel a million miles away. Whilst it is a large resort (and they were at 80% capacity when I stayed) it really doesn't feel crowded at all. The pool areas feel spacious and the beach is lovely.   We stayed in a Grand King Room. The room was very spacious, very clean and had a private balcony. The bed was very comfortable and the aircon cool. The breakfast was AMAZING!   The property is located directly opposite the main shopping and dining area of Nusa Dua, location is perfect. The staff at the hotel are all about service and are so friendly and accommodating   I would definitely recommend this hotel and cannot wait to go…"
3,"Few times we have been stay in this Hotel, and here are our personal opinion to encourage them.   Positive :  1. Nice interior renovation room 2. Great environment hotel and they still keep good maintenance  3. Hotel Staff are nice, helpful and good attitude 4. Good for family hotel with kids playground  Improvement Needed  1. On Breakfast we ask for egg benedict but came with done boiled egg on the top of it. We asked two times and still remain the same. They need to learn how to put some standard of International Food especially Five Star Hotel standard.  2. Their food taste and standard for lunch and dinner are way from Grand Hyatt standard now.  3. We came for event, and funny part is one of the couch leg for our VIP guest is broken on stage.   I hope they can keep good job…"
3,"My wife and I honeymooned in Bali and stayed the last two nights at the Grand Hyatt because it is on the beach.  The beach was beautiful, by the way!  The staff were always very pleasant, from the concierge to the check-in and check-out, to the wait staff to those around the pool areas.    Our room looked great.  Very spacious, with a huge bed, and a fantastic bathroom, including a shower with very hot water, surrounded in glass that prevented the rest of the bathroom from fogging.  Free bottles of water were included, free fresh fruit, a refrigerator, coffee and tea, and as we were coming from another country, they provided us with a complimentary International electricity adapter to use during our stay.  We also took in the Kyria Spa, which was very nice.  We opted for just a…"
3,"I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in November for a company meeting. I was less than impressed with this establishment. When I went into the hotel, the toilet bowl had icky black stuff at the base of the toilet. Something you'd expect to see in an apartment lived in by 3 male students, and certainly not at the Grand Hyatt. If it was stained and hard to remove, it surely was time to have the whole toilet bowl changed.  In the shower, the shampoo and body soap shampoo bottles looked very cheap and the printed texts on the bottles fell off as I handled the bottles, making me worry about the quality of the soap / shampoo being used, if the quality of the bottle itself was anything to go by.    There was such a good cable tv menu and I was just looking forward to relax and watch…"
5,"I spent three nights at the Grand Hyatt after landing in Bali, using my Gold Passport points. I had a very easy and welcoming checkin, the glass of chilled juice and cold towel were quick welcome upon my arrival after a seriously long journey. The hotel is teeming with staff and all were pleasant and graceful. In fact I had more interactions and pleasantries with the staff than with the other guests. As I wanted to ease into my journey I did the Grand Club experience which did not disappoint. Lovely breakfast every morning and a special call out to Eka, who was so kind to me during my stay. She was a gem to speak with and offered many insights on Bali culture and also took an extra effort to call my next accommodation to seek transport. I honestly felt so welcome and really felt…"

3,"Just returned from our holiday. I first stayed at the Grand Hyatt  when it first opened and decided to pay a visit to see the changes . Well , let's just say it need to be spruced up. The rooms are nice and clean , the staff are very good and the gardens are awesome.Our room had a koi pond in front and was delightful. However, it needs quite a it of TLC to bring it back to Hyatt standard. I noticed that the gym was very good ,but please get new bicycles that are not rusty and have brakes that work😱😱 The breakfast was really not up to standard ,we tried at Salsa Verde once ,but it's like fly central and no one seemed to try to cover anything up either. I would like to make a special comment about Sherin, the pancake lady,as we called her,what a gem ,I wish she has a great…"

Price: start from US$ 190 per night."
4,"Love the scene, love the room, love the breakfast menu :)  Love the ambiance around the hotel and especially the swimming pools.  The gym place was also a highlight especially for my husband. It's clean, neat and tidy. "
5,"My Husband and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary here . From the moment we arrived we were made very welcome! Everyone is friendly . We were upgraded to an ocean view room in the south wing it was fantastic . On the day of anniversary we relieved a beautiful bouquet of flowers from the management .The gardens are immaculate , the breakfast great . The only downfall was the weather ( out of the hotels control )!!  We still managed to enjoy ourselves.  Thankyou to all the staff ."
3,"We have just got back from Grand Hyatt which we had bought a package from Luxury Escapes. The package included meals, massages, airport pick up and drop offs manicures and pedicures. As far as the package goes - we couldn't fault it. The Champagne breakfast was an absolutely surprise and just scrumptious. All meals we had were nice including breakfast which mostly had at Salsa Verde and as we used the vouchers around the resort they were all taken with a smile and had good service.  Now, the Grand Hyatt. We found the resort nice. The gardens were lovely and the staff were also friendly. Our room was also nice and clean with a lovely view of the lagoon and beach.  Our biggest gripe was the size of this resort. It was huge and to get to our room from anywhere it took forever to…"

5,The placement of the hotel near the beach and its lush greenery was  a treat for our eyes.  The entire pool and beach side was cool. Very good food and friendly service. The staff were extremely courteous and warm.
2,"I usually tell my business associates to stay at Grand Hyatt Jakarta, since they have such a good place and services.  So I would expect at least the same service level and property quality.    The thing I would have the most say is the room.   It's quite old, but still acceptable.  But the humid and stale smells lingering during our stay.   And the room air conditioner, no matter how low we set the temperature, it would stay on 28-29 centigrade.   This is imagine sleeping in that kind of temperature.   Definitely not gonna be our next place to stay. "

But if you want to enjoying wi beaches...nightlife, crowed, and full masti.. its hindi word (masti) then please I recommend the place"
5,"From the moment I stepped through the main entrance, I was greeted with friendliness and warmth.  Complimentary juice and a refreshing towel were provided during check-in, and the manager even stopped by to welcome us.  We were escorted to our room which had been upgraded to a true ocean-view room, all while the staff member was explaining the hotel layout to us and the different dining options.  The room itself was wonderful and very spacious, particularly the bathroom, and we were pleasantly surprised to see a plate of fresh fruit and several jars of snacks presented on a table, all complimentary (presumably because of my Gold Passport Platinum status).  The hotel grounds is lush with vegetation as well as numerous pools, creating a very calm and peaceful atmosphere.  We…"

The staff are so delightful they are very courteous and helpful and always smiling.  Our holiday was sad this time, as my husband passed away in September.  I went with my two sons and girlfriend, and although I missed my husband very much, it was a good place to recover from the bad time we had been through.  The hotel is spotlessly clean, as are the rooms.

We were very pleased. The rooms are…"

It is however spread out over a fair area and the main Restaurant was closed this past week or so therefore had to hunt around the other restaurants on site.. and there were good options but you had to walk a while to find them"

The staff English ability is quite poor so getting your message accross can be hard at time.   Also, the staff's handling of food is not up to global standards.   As an example, they will handle bread and things with their bare hands.  No one knows where those hands have been but I have seen them put bread out with their barehands and also touch many food items.   This makes me uncomfortable in a place where you constantly have to worry about water and getting sick.      Also, a bad experience when checking in when I asked for an upgrade.

4,"Upon arriving at the Hyatt for a 2 night stay, first impressions were good. The grounds are very nice and well manicured and landscaped with beautiful facilities. The check-in however was horrible, even as a Hyatt Gold Passport member. They made a mistake with our booking, I had my receipt and itinerary with 2 nights however they only organised one night. They then made us wait for 30 minutes in their outdoor area with all our carry bags. After some time I grew impatient and went to follow up and they told us they were having trouble getting a room with one bed instead of two so needed to organise someone to go and convert the room and it would take another 30 minutes. We ended up telling them to just let us in the room and they can do it while we were in there.  The room was…"
4,"Good points:  Spacious rooms, great views, beautiful lush gardens and pools.   One of the staff, Armik, at Garden Cafe, was friendly and helpful. She returned a wallet left in the cafe, with everything untouched. Thank you for your warmth and honesty. The food at Garden cafe was good, too, but pricey.  Not-so-good points:  Food hygiene at Watercourt must be improved. There are flies perpetually clinging to the ham, cold cuts and smoked fish. I ate only covered, hot food, but I was terrified. There are candles beside the open serving dishes, and this suggests that the management knows there's a problem.

Big rooms with great hospitality. You feel like a king and queen, we want to go back sometime! Terimah Kasih Bali!"
5,"We stayed at Grand Hyatt Bali for 7 days for our honeymoon and couldn't have asked for a resort as great as this, the facilities were amazing, the breakfast (which was included for us) was great, not the same stuff everyday but a lot of choice. really sad part of Bali, we were worried about what we had heard about certain parts of Bali but we felt very safe here :-)  I would recommend this to Familes and couples alike as they have a great pool area.  it was also in close proximity to Bali Collection which was an area with loads of different restaurants if you wanted a change."
5,"I was here for a business conference.  I was offered an upgraded room on a top (4th) floor (2428) with a beautiful view of a separate garden pool and ocean.  Check in was great, but it is very hot and there is no AC in the lobby, so if you arrive in business attire, it can be traumatic.  The rooms are great.  Super clean, modern with fridge, great AC, bathrooms with lots of room and walk-in shower (rain type) and huge tub with a door to balcony.  Lot of light and views.  Ice delivered quickly upon request (I did get really sick, not sure from what, but ice is a suspect).  Lots of outlets and very business friendly.  The pools are super hot in temperature (other pools I used in Bali were cool), so I am not sure why they are like ""hot tub"" hot.  My garden area was never busy and…"
4,"Upon arriving at the Hyatt for a 2 night stay, first impressions were good. The grounds are very nice and well manicured and landscaped with beautiful facilities. The check-in however was horrible, even as a Hyatt Gold Passport member. They made a mistake with our booking, I had my receipt and itinerary with 2 nights however they only organised one night. They then made us wait for 30 minutes in their outdoor area with all our carry bags. After some time I grew impatient and went to follow up and they told us they were having trouble getting a room with one bed instead of two so needed to organise someone to go and convert the room and it would take another 30 minutes. We ended up telling them to just let us in the room and they can do it while we were in there.  The room was…"
4,"Good points:  Spacious rooms, great views, beautiful lush gardens and pools.   One of the staff, Armik, at Garden Cafe, was friendly and helpful. She returned a wallet left in the cafe, with everything untouched. Thank you for your warmth and honesty. The food at Garden cafe was good, too, but pricey.  Not-so-good points:  Food hygiene at Watercourt must be improved. There are flies perpetually clinging to the ham, cold cuts and smoked fish. I ate only covered, hot food, but I was terrified. There are candles beside the open serving dishes, and this suggests that the management knows there's a problem. There must be a better solution - perhaps installing UV fly zappers on the walls, or keeping the food in an enclosed air-conditioned section (the entire Watercourt cafe is open,…"

4,This is a very nice hotel.  The room I had in the 3207 was sort of facing the ocean over a pond and a lawn really about the farthest you can be from the ocean and call it an ocean view.  Would probably not pay the upcharge for this room.  The rooms have comfortable beds big showers and tubs good room service and water updated daily.  My King bed was in good shape and the room had a mix of modern and Bali in the same scheme quite pleasant.  Given that about 60% of the people that come here are convention people surprised not working area for a computer.  There is a traditional Bali sleeping platform bu I also felt the idea of what had happened on it without a cover was not worth getting into it.  There are multiple pools but this is a big place I mean a big resort 650 rooms so…
5,"Besides being a fabulous resort with great rooms and beautiful surroundings right on the beach, i experienced a high level of service after leaving. i forgot my toiletry bag, and poor Ardalita Sovyan at the front desk had to struggle with international couriers making mistakes , wrapping content in bags , tracking the bag for me, etc. She did great and i remain grateful for her persistence. Thank you, Lita!!"
5,"We've just spent 8 nights at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua, (wife and 2 kids) and have to say it's one of the best hotels we ever stayed at..First class facilities,great pools and restaurants.Service was spot on! ..Highly recommended!. My only gripe...Happy Hour should have a choice of all cocktails not a limited list with mainly vodka offered!. "
4,"We only stay at the resort two days and one night. We booked a standard room, but I would not do that again, I would recommend booking a room with Grand Club privileges.  This resort is big and the gardens are beautiful. The beach front is nicely laid out, but the beaches are not as good as Thailand and Philippines.  The swimming pools are great and big.  Great for families and they have a nice area for adults.  The Balinese village is nice to walk around at night.  We had the buffet (Pasar Senggo)and there was a cultural show.  The good was fantastic with all types of Balinese food. I would rate this resort as a 4 star.  I would come back to this hotel, but as I mentioned we like Thailand and the Philippines much more."
4,"Stayed 2 nights at the Grand Hyatt Bali in November 2014 with the family and loved it.   Pros 1. Lovely hotel in a huge compound and lots of space. We were told it has 750 rooms and is the largest resort hotel  in Nusa Dua. For a hotel of this size and it was 90% occupancy when we were there, we never once felt that the place was over crowded. That's due to the resort being well spread out with plenty of activities to cater to everyone. The pool was amazing for us and we spent so much time at the pool. The water slide is simply awesome. The kids had so much fund feeding the fishes and with the added adventure of three komodo dragons lurking nearby.  2. Service at check in and at the Grand Cafe was top notch. As we booked the Grand Club room and was upgraded to a suite, the Duty…"

4,"Pro's- amazing pool Great restaurants. Best part of hotel is staff, it's like your in a 7 star hotel, everyone knows your name, and so wanting to help with anything. Special shout out to lucas, he is incredible. Spa is one of the best in the world (and I've been to many)  Con's Place is way to large. You can get lost just going back to your room.  Rooms are a bit dated.  Oh did I mention how big the place is.   Overall  nice, but I prefer smaller and more intimate.  "
5,i hve never seen a more beautiful property than this ...makes you feel on top of the world... the spread is large and the beach is white and blue . the rooms are a little small though but on the whole the place is very beautiful....
4,This is my 3rd visit to the Grand Hyatt Bali. I've always stayed at the Grand Hyatt Club Access which I highly recommend. Unfortunately this time the nice club area is closed for construction. They do use the lobby area for the temporary club. I assume it will be even better once the remodel finishes. They serve great breakfast and happy hour with good customer service.  I had one of their new rooms which is smaller but the design is much more modern. They now have a Japanese type couch area where you can relax on a bed like surface. The bathroom is nicely designed with a rain shower. Housekeepers were great. Very efficient and always kept the rooms cleaned. Only issue I had was with the adjoining door to another room. Had a loud guest one night (luckily not on other nights).…
5,"My husband and I enjoyed our stays at grand Hyatt. The food was fantastic. I loved the free latte and cocktails at the club lounge. If you're staying here, stay in club lounge. Happy hour had appetizers good enough for a light meal! I really loved the pond with alligators and ducks swimming in it- only in club lounge users."
5,"I stayed in this hotel in early Nov. This period is low season and so not very crowdy in Nusa Dua. This hotel is really big as a resort hotel. Also, getting close to Bali collection point also good to access to other restaurant too. Overall speaking, a very relax and clean hotel to stay at. Hotel view at reception is beautiful. I would consider to stay here again in next Bali visit!"

5,"We've been going back to bali every year since the 2000s and stayed at countless hotels. Ever since we've discovered The Grand Hyatt Bali, we have not stayed at any other resorts. We had our wedding ceremony there in mid august and it was nothing less than amazing!  The staff attended to our every need (as always) and we're definitely going again very soon! A little pricey but this is Nusa Dua, and it is well worth the money for a 5 star hotel!"
4,"Location a bit far from the party places like Kuta, Legian or Seminyak. However, the hotel itself provides nice quiet environment from the buzz, a very nice change. Beach front view is superb! Breakfast provided is decent. There are some nice eateries near the hotel within walking distance. "
5,"Very subtle, classic, gorgeous hotel with excellent service. Grand Hyatt is its own town with small boutique stops and very nice restaurants (we went to both the Garden Cafe and the Italian restaurant - excellent!). I love the walk in the garden - great way to ""get lost"". Compared to other new hotel with modern / concrete design, Hyatt is a garden that happens to have hotel rooms hide around. "
5,"One of the best hotels Iv stayed at, rooms and so modern and good floor pan. Everything is 5 star from the gym to the resturants, not one negative comment around this hotel I will miss those breakfast buffets everyday!"
4,"Grand Hyatt Bali is a 5star recommended hotel. The hotel with the gardens are very big and very good. The service is very friendly and the shopping places and restaurants are very near and good. Guests can go every where and enjoy very wel. Nice surrounding and next to the beach. Stay at Grand Hyatt Bali is next to everything you need and enjoy your stay,because everything are nearby."

4,Have just returned from a 9 day stay at the Grand Hyatt. We have been staying at Nusa Dua hotels for over 20 years but this was our first time at the Grand Hyatt and  we will definitely be back.  The Hotel was nearly full but because of the hotels design you would never know as it was very quiet. it is close to the Bali Collection shopping complex which is also a bonus.   Although the pool was very warm at this time of the year the ocean was great.  Much better beach than in front of the hotels around the corner.  The only complete we have were the beds. We requested a double bed and was given 2 single beds and we found the mattress's were like boards.  We asked for a foam cover or mattress change but only given a blanket under the sheet. Next time we definitely want a double…
5,"We arrived at the hotel on a Thursday afternoon, 30 minutes away from Ngurah Rai Denpasar Airport. As we were a group of 30 or so, our check-in was done separately, rather than at the main lobby. This is to avoid confusion and crowding the check-in area, which is a great thought. There was a cold tower and a welcome drink. After checking in, we were guided to our rooms, which we thought was necessary since the place is huge (thus the title 'get lost')!  There were 4 blocks, and I believe we stayed at the South Block (our room started with 32XX, one floor above the ground). It was easy to get lost since there was not much signage around. The hotel does provide a simple map when you check in but it does not do much if you don't know where you are at in the first place.  Rooms had…"
5,"Excellent summarises this facility. The place was close to capacity whilst we were there for 10 days.....not that you could tell. It appeared really quiet....but such is the set-up and clever design. The staff are incredibibly friendly and helpful (though not all speak good English), and if unable to assist promptly find someone who is able. The facilities and grounds are spectacular and immaculate. The bed and pillows were the most comfortable that I have experienced (other than my own), this is coming from someone who has a very bad back. The spa onsite is also an amazing experience. We had x2 30min massages included in our package, and was up there with the best experiences. We had a level 4 room which provided a little more breeze then would have been experienced on the…"
5,"Please read other reviews about Nusa Dua. I did and found them very useful. It happened that we wanted to use our package almost straight away. So, I’m writing this as I sit at Denpasar Airport waiting for the flight home. I believe that more than 500 “escapes” were sold, so there will be a lot of happy visitors over the next 12 months.  We bought the VIP upgrade version of the package, for (I think) about $AUD200 extra. Glad we did, but whatever the package, this is a fantastic deal.  So here goes.  The Grand Hyatt Bali. A great resort hotel, as most other reviewers have said. The point I would make is that the hotel made it very easy for us to use our various vouchers. As a general principle, I advise making use of the vouchers as soon as possible. We left a couple until late,…"
5,"Living in Australia, Bali is one of the closest tropical escapes off shore. Until now it's allure had eluded us. We were offered a deal we couldn't refuse, and I'm so glad we did. The Hyatt is truly grand with fabulously kind and generous people everywhere. The grounds are picturesque with swimming pools for every need and fish pond filled with giant Koi. Our package provided us with the chance to experience every restaurant, which was a bonus. As lovers of all things Nippon, we declared Lampu the absolute stand out. We went three times and felt we could have been in Tokyo....yes that good. The Sriya spa is fabulous for a little personal treat, and our very own pool was beautiful. I would like to offer a criticism, but I cant. The service culture is warm, without being cloying ,…"

5,"Stayed here for 4 nights. The staff were friendly and service oriented - most of them have a smile on their faces when they saw you, makes you feel welcome. The room was huge and well equipped with the amenities you need such as in room safe, heater, hair dryer etc. You probably will get either a ""pond / lake"" view or the sea view from your room. I've got a pond view which is nice too. However the sound proofing is not that great, you can hear noises easily from other rooms at night (which might be quite a pain if you are trying to sleep). Food is good. Pool is good. Private beach is awesome. And it is 5 minutes walk away from Bali Shopping Collection where you can shop for souvenirs, clothes etc. The spa is a MUST TRY! Excellent massage in a villa by yourself. Overall it has…"
4,"If you are looking for a cosy boutique hotel, this is clearly not the right choice. However, if you are looking for a great standard accommodation, good food and facilities and beautiful scenery, look no further.  An easy 20 minute drive from the airport, the HUGE resort is one of the most stunningly beautiful hotels I have stayed in Asia or elsewhere. Everywhere is covered with stunning flowers, statues and decorative pools. The Watergarden restaurant for breakfast is lovely. My U9 kids loved the pool, especially the long waterside and it was easy to keep an eye on them from the sun loungers.  The pool side service for food and drinks was very good, and the room service was fast and easily accommodated my kids' pizza and sandwich gravings even though they weren't on the menu.…"
4,"This is my 3rd visit to Bali and my 2nd to the Hyatt (the other visit was to the Westin).  As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a large sprawling luxury hotel in Nusa Dua. The hotel has several nice pools, a choice of restaurants and plenty to do in the vicinity. However, also as other reviewers have mentioned, it is not quite perfect.  But first to the rooms. They are large, comfortable, have free wifi (albeit limited to normal surfing and emails, not for video conferencing and heavy streaming loads) - very adequate for most people's use. But, they are not quite up to present day 5 star standards. In particular, as we were a family of four, we needed storage space, especially with 4 suitcases and a set of golf clubs ini tow. The small 3-drawer cupboard located under the…"
4,"We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel. It's a family reunion, so we book multiple rooms. Hyatt accommodated us very well. We have a lot of memories in here. All staffs are polite and courteous. The hotel is a little bit older but it's well maintained. The buffet breakfast is great - hot and cold breakfast, fruit and cakes but it lacks variety, especially if you stay 6 nights or longer like us. We can also order omelettes, if we don't like the watery scrambled eggs. The hotel also has a few restaurants on-site. So, if you get bored eating the provided buffet, there is always option to choose. The hotel also provides us with a free wifi for the first two devices.   We have a little incident, one of the room has a lizard inside. We reported this to the hotel receptionist and they…"
5,"The place is simply amazing. The view from any room is wonderful. The food from the restaurants is delicious and the staff is always at your disposal. We had a complaint about some noisy room neighbours, and the day after they either moved them to other rooms or they asked them to keep the noise down because we didn't hear them any more. The ocean beach is the best :) so are all the swimming pools. Once you step out of the complex, you step into the local mall, the Bali Collection. The downside of this region is that the prices are pretty high. Everything is almost double the price compared to the Ubud area. Even in supermarkets. There is a huge difference between 5* and 4* hotels, and i strongly recommend that you pick a hotel that has beach access."

So, if you get bored eating the provided buffet, there is always option to choose. The hotel also provides us with a free wifi for the first two devices.   We have a little incident, one of the room has a lizard inside. We reported this to the hotel receptionist and they…"
5,"The place is simply amazing. The view from any room is wonderful. The food from the restaurants is delicious and the staff is always at your disposal. We had a complaint about some noisy room neighbours, and the day after they either moved them to other rooms or they asked them to keep the noise down because we didn't hear them any more. The ocean beach is the best :) so are all the swimming pools. Once you step out of the complex, you step into the local mall, the Bali Collection. The downside of this region is that the prices are pretty high. Everything is almost double the price compared to the Ubud area. Even in supermarkets. There is a huge difference between 5* and 4* hotels, and i strongly recommend that you pick a hotel that has beach access."
2,"Having recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt Taipei, the Grand Hyatt Bali leaves a lot to be desired. Run down facilities, broken furniture, poor food and pathetic policies (like not allowing guests to access the bar area near reception... or not serving light snacks there). May be a Hyatt but it's not a ""Grand"". Huge resort-style hotel. Not my cup of tea."
5,"Set in a wonderfully landscaped environment teeming with wildlife and the wonders of nature this hotel resort is to be highly recommended.  The rooms and suites are spacious, clean and well presented and the ocean views spectacular.  The pools jacuzzis and relaxation areas are plentiful, for those looking to get in a bit of sun bathing I'd especially recommend the cold water pool which is set at 12 degrees and perfect for cooling down between lounger sessions."
4,"The hotel occupies a large plot of land and as such, one would never feel claustrophobic but at the same time the walk to the rooms can be a little long. Having said that, rooms are well appointed and whilst it shows its age, its still maintained well. Breakfast service was rather chaotic - the few days we were there, the restaurants staff at all the three places were clearly struggling to cater to the capacity and we feel this merits a serious and rather urgent attention from the mgt. Service was professional but not overly warm. We feel that this deserves more of a 3.5* rating but being in Bali, we perhaps can afford to be a little generous with our review. Gd hotel but there're issues to be resolved (clearly)"
5,"We had never flown to an island before, but this was worth the trip. Lush gardens weave through this property and make any walk so serene. The beach was just breath-taking, and the spa was the best kept secret! Our room had ocean view, so nice to wake up and see the waves coming in!"
5,"I have stayed at Grand Hyatt Bali many times over the past 20 years... many things have changed (for the good) but one this has remained constant, the warm, gracious and exceptional service from all of the staff.  This is one of the best resort hotels in the world.  Whilst rooms are very comfortable and well appointed (not the most luxurious but then rates are only US$200 ish) it is the resort as a whole that is so impressive.  Amazing pools (5 or 6!) all with different themes/styles, great restaurants, lovely beach, dinner theatre shows nightly, exceptional world class Spa, one of the most impressive landscaping and gardens you will ever see, the list goes on and on.  Combine this with incredible service it simply is a special place. We have stayed in deluxe villa hotels on…"

5,"I visited bali around 3 years ago, but its worth it to write a review for this hotel! The private beach at the hotel was amazing to just relax as other commercial beaches in bali are crowded and dirty. Its located in Nusa Dua which is the most beautiful region in bali!  The swimming pool has a very fun design and a restaurant is located beside it which usually serves breakfast there. The hotel was overall a great stay, Id say the best hotel in bali! "
5,The hotel is very nice - loved the gardens and flowers plus the ocean view.  The pool was large and fun to take a quick dip after a long day of sightseeing.  Our room was a ocean front grand king suite on the top floor with a balcony.  The room was very nice and clean.  Hotel staff that we encountered were all friendly and helpful.
5,"I stayed here at Grand King room for 2 nights on October 2014. Got a pond view room. Tried to ask the reception to move our room to beach view room. However, they said there is additional charges on that, so we decided not to move.   Staying there for 2 nights was so amazing. Love the hotel so much. The whole area is very huge. It has 5 swimming pool inside. The pool and private beach are awesome. The entire view of the hotel is just perfect.   All staff were very friendly. They always greet us when passing us by.   The room was very comfortable. Two things I was disappointed about: the room floor was very dusty and the upper stand shower was broken.   The rest experience in this hotel was so amazing. Love this hotel so much. Very recommended!"
5,"Stayed here for a weekend with the family and had an amazing time. The rooms are comfortable but you will want to spend your time outside at the beach, pool and restaurants! The food is quite expensive for what it is. Otherwise highly recommended! "
5,"Ah, paradise is not lost when you are at the Grand Hyatt Bali. Every amenity you can think of is available. People are friendly, nurturing and very flexible. We loved the spa, the morning buffet breakfast and the three dining venues we sampled, Japanese, Italian and Balinese. Truly a place to forget the outside world and appreciate the finer things of life."

5,"In a market crowded with good choices, the Grand Hyatt Bali is a winner.  My room was very comfortable.  The bathroom was impeccably clean and everything worked.  I liked the unexpected touches, like the day bed in its own nook by the window.  And little extras they provided like the fruit tray and jars of goodies: cashew nuts, cookies, etc.  Wifi was complimentary (but I don't know if that's for everyone or just for Hyatt Gold Passport members).  The grounds were beautifully landscaped.  The resort in kind of an isolated location.  There is a mall right beside it with shopping and restaurants.  But the neighborhood is too ""sanitized"".  If I could have one quibble, that would be it.  You do not get a sense of the local culture.  That neighborhood could fit right in Orlando,…"
5,"This time travelled to Bali with a group of colleagues from my company. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt it certainly had the ""Grand"" friendly, lovely grounds, good facilities. Excellent pools and the beach was great and kept clean."
5,"The hotel at it's grandeur concept. The service is impeccable but a little too much.  Haha why? Just after my breakfast meal i came back to my room and to find the service staff cleaning the room unlimited times. I'm impress.  Yet again i love the scenery,  the silent peace around.   Also not so peaceful with the location of my room. My room was location far West and i have to walk all the way and seriously walking at night is no joke cz there was once i couldn't find my way room.  More visible signage to be suggested.   Overall i really spent my holidays here. Will come again when i have the chance.  "
5,"I wanted to thank the Grand Hyatt staff for a brilliant holiday. We recently visited with my family including (4 and 5 year old).  We shared the standard room and the day bed for the kids and king bed for us suited our needs perfectly. We stayed at this hotel about 10 years ago and loved it then for the exceptional service and amazing gardens, it didn't disappoint and I am sorry we haven't been back sooner.   During our stay, my husband required medical help and the staff made what would have been so stressful an easy experience.  He had been attended to by the hotel doctor, a car arranged and taken to the local medical centre and was then back poolside in a couple of hours.  I am really thankful that they were able to help him out.  In talking to a staff member, they said the…"
3,"I must admit that I found the Nusa Dua area of Bali, rather like the Truman Show, a complete alternate reality which I didn't enjoy. The grounds of the Grand Hyatt are lovely, very beautiful however as I was there for work it did make traversing the grounds rather complicated.   My room was old, dark and very dated. It looked over a swamp, well it felt as though it was a swamp. There were other rooms that were lovely, huge with nice views, however I felt as though I paid significant amount of money for a poor room.   Food in the hotel was ok, the Japanese was good, I found the other options less than inspiring.   In terms of work this hotel is terrible, there is no business centre, so to get a document printed, signed and scanned. I needed to email to the staff, then have them…"

5,Great holiday for couples or family's. The water slides provide hours of energetic fun for kids.  While the acres of gardens and pools provide areas for couples to seek more serene areas.  Endless food choices and clean and spacious rooms. This was our third visit and hopefully won't be our last.
3,"A big brand, nice landscaping.   Regret the entire building including the hotel room and furniture are old and run down. When walking on the walkway from my room to the lift lobby make me feel like I'm staying in a hostel. This hotel needs serious renovation.   We left this hotel after 3 nights stay to check in to another hotel nearby."
4,"Was there for a big company gathering. When I said big, it really was. 600 people of us were stayed there.  The hotel located in Nusa Dua, one of Bali's exclusive area. In this area, there are also some famous top hotel, such as Mulia.  This hotel ground area is sooooo wide. Almost tire us when we walked to reached our room. But... The back scenery of my room was fascinating.  The hotel is quite old, so the style is a bit old, also. I mean, it is not that one minimalist hype style hotel.   As a top class hotel, I could easily said that the services are awesome. The foods are delicious also. A good example of their good service happened to me when I need to check out at night. The staffs helped me through all the craziness due to a lot of things I have to carry. ( i was on…"
3,"I was here a couple of years and I was blown away by the property, our room, the grand lounge facilities and the overall service.  This time around looks like everything has dropped down several notches since we were here last.   Time to find new resorts for next time in Bali.   "
5,"We stayed only a couple of days at the Grand Hyatt Bali to finish off our holiday in Bali. It was a perfect way to round off our holiday. The grounds are beautiful, the pools couldn't be better and the staff were amazingly friendly and helpful without exception. We have now returned to Australia only to discover that there is an amazing deal available to stay for 8 nights at the Grand Hyatt on Luxury Escapes. This makes it very tempting for us to go back next year but my wife and I have agreed that we need to wait a couple of years before our next holiday. However, we will definitely mention this deal to our friends. Thank you Grand Hyatt for a lovely couple of days."

4,"Ready to waste money and enjoy luxuriness if you choose this hotel already.  The best is the beach. Long golden sand beach and crystal clear sea water. You can enjoy swim and waves during high tides. Also you can find big starfishes and crabs when low tides.  Sun tan chairs are comfortable and enough under trees which have rich branches and leaves. Squirrels are running on the trees and coming down to get nuts or cookies from peoples hands.  Inside gardens are tremendously beautiful with full bloomed flowers everywhere.  Buffet breakfast in main and italian restaurants are rich and delicious. Lunch and supper meals are in excellent quality and clean. Just in front of the hotel for 5 minutes walk from the beach, there is Bali collection - very dirty, waiting for an hour, rip off,…"
5,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 months from December 2013 to March 2014,  The location is stunning, The hotel is set in beautifully kept gardens with magnificent water lily ponds and mini lakes throughout. The beach is sublime!  Swimming pools throughout the hotels grounds are fabulous & well maintained. Food is excellent throughout the hotels many restaurants, from breakfast in the Italian restaurant where there is a huge selection of both Asian and European dishes. Staff are extremely friendly helpful & gracious, & very attentive, especially with young children..  Rooms are very comfortable and well serviced by very courteous. There is also a very good selection of shops within the hotel which are reasonably priced and are all of good quality. My overall experience was one of…"
4,"The Hyatt hotel displays beautiful local architecture and all the elements for an Indonesian adventure feeling, the ocean, the multiple ponds throughout the property and great attention to detail will make you feel like at home. I wish I could have stayed longer. Nice mall across the street with many souvenir stores and great prices to choose from."
5,"I actually hated going here last August, because I had to go here on business, and couldnt enjoy the resort as much as I wanted to. But, this hotel is one of the most beautiful and well-executed resorts I have ever seen. It is huge, beautifully laid out, and it is a pleasure to get lost in the hotel grounds while looking for your way - just like what a vacation should be like where no one is in a rush and once can get pleasantly lost in the scenery. I had a room with a terrace facing a lagoon, with what lloked like a hundred year old tree, and all kinds of birds flitting around. I even saw a huge monitor lizard on the grounds just walking past some oblivious Korean guests.   The rooms are wonderful, expansive, and quite cozy - with the best part being the day bed in the corner -…"

5,"What a beautiful resort! Organized a last minute girly week end with a friend and we were both happy with our stay. From the airport pick up, to the food, to the beauty of the resort, to the choice of pools, or to the amazing beach...  Away from Seminyak (but the hotel is happy to arrange transport), we were happy to enjoy the calm during the day and still be able to enjoy the restaurants and bars of Seminyak in the evenings. Great location.   One minor issue on the Sunday morning: we were woken up at 6:30 by some kind of sports event happening next door. Can't really blame the Hyatt, but 6:30am on a Sunday is just cruel..."
5,First thing that captivated me was the lotus pond in the middle of a serene and artistic garden. We had a great view of it surrounded by lots of greens.   Spacious rooms even comes with a day bed the size of a queen bed on top of the original oversized twin beds. Needless to mention the walk-in closet and separate shower and bath tub. Wholesome pampering experience.   Downside though the floor was a little dusty and small hiccup during check-in though I really didn't mind because we came in such a huge group. The breakfast has done little to impress as there was limited selection as menu is the same for several days.    Beautiful beach. Would certainly come back again.
2,Many years ago I stayed in the same hotel and was really pleased but this time i cannot say the same. The hotel has become too big and it has become a tourist processing machine..all the charm of Bali has been wiped away and you could be anywhere else in the world and would not notice the difference.  My kids loved the pool though and i have to say that the buffet was quite good.  The beach in front to the hotel is huge..but the sand is fairly rough. My room was a good 15 min walk from the reception.. so make sure you do not forget anything when you leave..
5,"Fantastic!! A very beautiful resort and friendly staff. We stayed there for 3 days wish we can stay a bit longer. I will definitely come back again next time. keep it up for all staff, You guys did a good job. From concierge to reception and housekeeping."
5,"Lets start by saying that i am Hyatt gold member and i use hyatt hotels a lot, i used points earned to pay for this stay, i was going to stop using hyatt hotels, as normally dont included breakfast or internet with the price of their rooms, so use my points and walk out, this hotel has changed my mind and i will continue using the group hotels.  Is a really spectacular resort beautiful gardens and pools, the check in took a bit longer than i will like, due to another guest say goodbye to the receptionist about 30 times in typically Japanese style, at check in i was given free breakfast and a ocean view room without me asking for it.  The room was everything we could ask, impresive, modern, clean and with a huge bed, great views of the ocean and panoramic window from the bath. …"

4,"Second visit. First time in 2006. Seemed a lot more peaceful this time. Still a beautiful resort.  Had a executive suite in the south wing. Fast check-in and excellent service.  However since the resort is so big, it takes a long walk to everywhere & anywhere. From our room to the elevator takes about 3 minutes! to the main pool alone takes good 7~8 minutes which makes it hard to go get something in our room.  Ask for a room near elevator or at least the lobby."
4,"One of the well established hotels, the Grand Hyatt is our first choice for family holidays in Bali. Offering the best of Nusa Dua with beach location, large lush gardens, pools and clean comfortable rooms. Delivering all you expect from a Grand Hyatt, it is well maintained with some wings newly renovated.  The spacious Grand Executive Suite with twin connecting room is an excellent choice for families. Breakfast is served in three locations with a decent buffet selection. Beachfront locations provides direct access to the path along the whole nusa dua and benoa coastline, good for running or evening walks. Several dining options are available within the hotel and a shopping complex with restaurants and shops is located just across. This Grand Hyatt is an old favourite, Nusa Dua…"
5,"We were in bali for a conference and had the opportunity to stay 2 nights in this property.   The hotel ground is big, the rooms are very well appointed, very generous in size. I especially like the spaciousness of the bathroom, but I wished there were 2 wash basins instead of one.  We didn't have much interactions with the staff but whatever little interactions we had, it was very pleasant and they were very eager to help.  This is a very nice property for those who like to relax and basically do nothing. Bali Collection (collection of retail outlets) is practically at the door step. Other than the beach, there isn't much to do here. So if u like clubbing and more happenings, this isn't a place for u."
5,"Fantastic resort... Very beautiful with a wonderfully landscaped garden. The lotus and koi ponds make the trip worthwhile.   The staff were very helpful and attentive, though due to the size of the resort, their response time was a little slow.   I will have to say that their rooms are gorgeous and very big. We stayed in the east village (there are 5 villages here I think) and the rooms were very spacious and comfortable.   Food is good with excellent choice of restaurants. However, given that there is a shopping complex just opposite the resort with ample choice of bars and food I would say feeding your hungry palates would not be an issue."
5,"came for a short visit with parents and my younger brother. excellent service. the crew goes to all extent in making sure we receive the best we can. great area for couples on honeymoon etc. the resort is super hugeeee and has really nice scenery. the room n the bed were big. 4 of us managed to fit into 1 bed, and we prolly can take another person. beautiful private beach too. if i have the chance, i would love to come back again. thank you for the awesome stay and making our trip memorable. :)"
4,"Second visit. First time in 2006. Seemed a lot more peaceful this time. Still a beautiful resort.  Had a executive suite in the south wing. Fast check-in and excellent service.  However since the resort is so big, it takes a long walk to everywhere & anywhere. From our room to the elevator takes about 3 minutes! to the main pool alone takes good 7~8 minutes which makes it hard to go get something in our room.  Ask for a room near elevator or at least the lobby."
4,"One of the well established hotels, the Grand Hyatt is our first choice for family holidays in Bali. Offering the best of Nusa Dua with beach location, large lush gardens, pools and clean comfortable rooms. Delivering all you expect from a Grand Hyatt, it is well maintained with some wings newly renovated.  The spacious Grand Executive Suite with twin connecting room is an excellent choice for families. Breakfast is served in three locations with a decent buffet selection.

4,"We went to Bali for about a week in early July to enjoy the sun and the sea, staying three nights at the Grand Hyatt followed by three more nights at the InterContinental. The Grand Hyatt was quite good and on the whole lived up to expectations, though there were a few problems.   The Grand Hyatt consists of four sprawling structures on a huge site filled with Indonesian-style landscaped gardens. Although it was built quite a few years ago it is still quite well maintained. While we were there parts of the east section (including the Grand Club pool) was closed for renovation.   Our room was quite spacious and nicely decorated, though nothing really luxurious. There was a daybed tugged at a corner next to the balcony. It was perfect for our teenage son and there was no need to…"
5,"Sprawling yet cozy beach resort. I love my ground floor room which is huge with a walk-in wardrobe. On the resort ground, there are a couple of option for where to eat, more than one swimming pool to dip into and a lot to explore. The white sandy beach is just nice to while away your time. Perfect place for that much needed break."
4,Great hotel and excellent staff. Very nice bedrooms. Excellent location on a long beach and beautiful hotel grounds. As with all 5* hotels the restaurants charge extortionate prices for food and drink but there were plenty of other restaurants to visit. Club lounge was relaxed.
4,"I stayed 4 nights in Bali with my family, 2 nights at the Grand Hyatt and 2 nights at the Mulia (see my other review of the Mulia).  Without a doubt, in terms of value as well as experience (from a family perspective), the Grand Hyatt was a much better resort.  The service was very warm and friendly, although not always the speediest - I believe the pace in Bali is much slower, so as a tourist we just need to take things easy.  When lounging by their amazing landscaped pool, there was always someone nearby waiting to take any drink orders, despite the hot sun!  We also arranged a baby cot, and the hotel also provided a baby bath tub, accessories and even a bath toy without us asking for it.  Absolutely amazed.  I have to mention the swimming pool(s) again, as well as the water…"
4,"I recently took a group to the Grand Hyatt Bali and can honestly say that they are definitely geared to cater for both group and individual travellers.  The hotel is large, and initially can be quite disorientating trying to find room numbers, however, as soon as you get your bearings ... it becomes really easy to navigate.  The staff are incredibly friendly and very attentive.  The setting is quite magical, and such a bonus to be so close to the Bali Collection shopping centre which is fabulous for off site meals and a little bit of retail therapy!   The spa at the Grand Hyatt Bali is incredible.  There is no doubt that you pay hotel spa rates and that you can get more reasonable treatments elsewhere - HOWEVER - the sheer indulgence and experience of this beautifully appointed…"

5,"Grand Hyatt Bali is just 20 mins away from the newly opened Ngurah Rai International Airport if you take the new toll way. It is situated in Nusa Dua which have really some of the nicest beaches! Grand Hyatt Bali was one of my first resort styled getaways! When I arrived at the hotel, I quickly fell in love with it! It was one of the most beautiful places that I seen. From the hotel lobby, you can see the sea and feel the cool sea breeze on your face.   The resort is huge! We had to walk quite a distance to our room but it was all worth it! We stayed in the Standard Grand King room. The room was big and spacious, it was furnished with one king bed, daybed and private balcony overlooking a serene lagoon. It has a bath with separate shower, and deluxe amenities which includes…"
5,"My second stay in this hotel after closed to 10 years, and to me surprise, it's still very well maintained. Large area with lotsa nice gardening and water features. Staffs are friendly (even the squirrels on the trees) and helpful. Nice and long stretch of beach. It's stone throw away from the water-blow cliff which we went twice in 3 days."
5,"Loved our stay here. We took the all-inclusive option, so was so relaxing and enjoyable. All food, drinks, kids' club and watersports were included. Fantastic lunches by the pool, the milkshakes were loved by the kids. Good sandy beach directly connected to the resort, so could take long easy walks any time of the day. No hawkers allowed near resort. Can sit on the lounges on the sand and witness gorgeous sunrises. Great experience for us."
5,Stayed for two nights at this beautiful hotel. Instantly transported to a tranquil and restful resort. Easy access to the beach. Particularly recommend breakfast at Salsa Verde for the wonderful view of the beach.

5,We visited this hotel for a conference. But i do recommend this hotel for future stay. The scenery seen very beutiful. The garden and the pool are nice to see many times. The atmosphere makrs you feel relax.
5,"Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua was probably one of the most beautiful hotels i have stayed at! We had a room overlooking the ""balinese feature pool"" this pool is amazing!! I went there twice and both times i went there i was the only one!! It was always warm too, as its in the sun! If you are staying here, you must check it out! the hotel lawns, gardens and surroundings were perfectly manicured and picture perfect. The place was massive and you can get lost pretty easily. Things in the hotel are pretty expensive, as you would expect. Staff were everywhere you went which was a bit much for me, but overall, i wish we stayed longer!!! "
4,"Good place to be with family looking for escape. The breakfast is limited choices. Great garden, beautiful fish ponds. The food provided for conference refreshment were great. The pool is crowded, so should book a club room with private club pool. There was a children club. The beach was not good for swimming.  Bathroom is dated. Staff were very friendly. Shopping is at Bali Collection but expensive. Only cost less than 10 dollars taxi fare to Kuta for better shopping."
5,"We have just spent one week in the hotel and found everything to be very good. The grounds are beautiful and a real feature, all 14 ha perfectly manicured. This is large hotel but you wouldn't realize this as you can feel quite secluded in certain areas. We had a club room of very substantial size, and the pool there was very quiet with few guests using it. The temporary club lounge in the lobby had stunning ocean views and sea breezes. The staff were all very accommodating. The new club lounge should be open in October with an open kitchen which will be excellent, following what many Hyatts are doing now. We ate in all the restaurants and found the food tasty and service good. All round we have had a relaxing stay, loving the beach location."
4,"Just completed a conference for over 90 doctors and it went really well once the hotel fully understood my requirements. It took some work but we got there in the end. Conference rooms are OK with high ceilings and authentic local feel.   Accommodation Rooms are looking a bit tired and the furniture needs to be replaced or up dated but overall we loved the peaceful atmosphere. Great not to have to fight for pool loungers, there were always plenty. Club was terrific, staff fantastic and very attentive. Good value for money, best location near Bali Collection. We will be back."

5,"It's our third visit and does not stop us from admiring this hotel, the view and its facilities. Kids and adults both have their own fun activities here, such as riding a bike, jogging, toddler pool and many other facilities. Recommended for family holiday."
5,"I normally stay at the Bali Hyatt in Sanur when I go to Bali, but it is now sadly closed for renovation, so I stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua instead.  The Grand Hyatt is beautiful and is true to the Balinese style of architecture and relaxation.  Even though it is a very large hotel each area of the hotel feels unique and intimate and you can find so many places to quietly reflect, read or relax alone.  The staff is always there when you need them and unseen when you don't, they are brilliant at Service!!  Although I prefer being in Sanur where I can walk out the hotel and be in a lovely beachside village, Nusa Dua is also a wonderful place to be, as is Any place in Bali!! The rooms are beautiful with the classic amazing Hyatt bed and fantastic bathrooms with lounging…"
4,"Having stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali in 1999 we were really looking forward to our holiday in Bali. However, our check in experience was terrible. We arrived at 1500 hours to be told our three rooms weren't ready (should have been available at 1400 hours)....and that we should find somewhere to sit (but there wasn't anywhere as all the seats were taken) This wasn't great as we were tired and also we had a two year and a five year old in our group! The attitude of the staff was just shrugging of their shoulders and motioning us away. We finally got one room at 1630 hours. As we got in there, the door opened behind us and it was someone to change the phone. Ten minutes later he went, and then another person arrived to fix the shower. And then finally our luggage arrived at the…"
5,The service is great. I had a bad experience with pest but that was swiftly dealt with and we then quickly moved on with the vacation Used the kids club several times and it was great and dependable service which the kids loved The beach is one of the best fronts in Nusa Dua. No complaints there. The pool is just fantastic and the kids loved the slides. The only thing that could be improved was the room view our first was too low and thus humid. But we got another which was fantastic of the lagoon. Loved the hotel since we were here 10 years ago. They have maintained it well with the night market very good and food services impeccable.  For me one of the best in Nusa Dua
4,"Family stayed here in late January 2014. Mainly stayed here as we are loyal to Hyatt (and were using a suite upgrade), price was right, and we hadn't tried this hotel yet.  Check-in: Airport on arrival has been updated since our last trip here in 2012. Wow what a difference. Feels like a world airport compared to what it once was. Inquired at booking to getting someone to help us through immigration as we had 2 small children this time. This obviously cost extra but given the chaos of the previous 2 times we did this - was certainly well worth it. Highly recommend this if traveling with little ones or traveling long distances (from the US). Nothing more frustrating than traveling 30 hours to stand in line for 90 minutes in a crowded hot room with small children to start off a…"

5,Have recently spent 4 nights at this lovely resort. The moment we arrived I felt relaxed. Check in was quick and simple. We had an amazing view of the sea from our room in the East Village. The evening Happy Hour at the Grand Club Lounge was a fantastic way to end the day before beginning your evening! The Balinese dance and food at Pasar Senggol was great.  Only thing I think could do with improving is the hot food selection in the buffet breakfast at The Grand Club. Not much choice and several times when we went to get something there was nothing left.
5,"Just returned from an incredibly relaxing week in this beautiful and friendly resort; as a family with 2 teenage boys we had 2 interconnecting rooms with beautiful views in the south wing, which was a short but lovely walk through the beautifully maintained walkways. Special thanks goes to Himawan Wasito,  Assistant Director of Food and Beverages. I contacted him in advance of our visit due to my son's severe dairy and shellfish allergies, and Himawan and all of the Food and Beverage staff recognised Daniel went out of their way to provide him with suitable, delicious food in the most friendly and caring manner possible - even when ordering room service. He will always remember the Ciabatta bread! I have never encountered such professionalism when trying to cater for my son's…"
5,"Overall comment:   The hotel gives you a feeling of pure relaxation and serenity from the moment you step in to the lobby. You can expect great smiles and warm welcomes from bellboy up till the check out day. Grand Hyatt has yet to disappoint my husband and I and we've been here 6 times before. Each trip promises total relaxation, pampering and sweet memories. We liked the place so much, we decided to throw our wedding there last week.   Here's a short feedback on my wedding experience:  The good stuff:  Hello Grand Hyatt. I owe it to you to say that I had an amazing beach wedding at your resort. Everything was lovely like a dream, my guests enjoyed the resort and the wedding, I loved the food and the decor was great - exactly as I expected and paid for. Also, a heartfelt thanks…"
4,"This is a beautifull hotel but the service does not match the facilities. The rooms are luxurious, spacious with all the necessary modcons. The lack of service spoils this experience. Breakfast is very poorly managed. If you order an egg such as poached or boiled, be prepared to wait 30 minutes, get it cold or not get it at all. If you happen to sleep in and go for breakfast in the last 30 minutes you will find a lot of empty serving plates which are not replenished. We had a function on the beach and it was a mission to get a glass of wine. The waiters did not seem to understand English and it took very long for them to clear the plates. Another big negative is that all bar areas close at 23h00 and we wanted to sit and social but could not get a glass of wine to drink. This…"
3,"If you don't like a big hotel, move on as this hotel is not for you. It is also quite far from any cultural activities or any tourist trap. Nusa Dua area is a collection of resorts for people who are happily stay in it. Of course you can get out, but it'd take you some time.  Set in at least 17 hectares of land, this is the second largest hotel in Bali. So you may have to walk quite a distance if you get the east or west wing. We happen to stay at the north wing, ocean facing room, so it's not too far of a track to the lobby area. The room is generously sized, the bed was firm, the large daybed was a treat, the bathroom was a nice size too. But that's it. As this is an older property, the age shows and I think it's time for a serious upgrade soon. The restaurant serves nice…"

5,"We have just arrived home from a beautiful stay at the Grand Hyatt we were blown away with the attention lavished on us during our stay by all the club lounge staff especially Urip . The rooms were a lovely size and clean. We were lucky enough to have one of their pools outside our room. Would recommend the resort to all couples, family and conferences . Will be back there with our adult family and their children."
2,"The hotel lobby is inviting and pretty enough, and the rooms a good size and comfortable. Other than that, there is nothing that makes this hotel special. Upon entering the Nusa Dua area which is stuffed with resorts, there was no sign of anything indigenous. Just pristine roadways, perfectly manicured lawns and networks of drives leading to various resorts, much like the Disney World collection. For all I knew, we were in Orlando all week! They offer a breakfast buffet at three different restaurants on the property, but we found out after 3 days of dining that all the buffet's were identical and lacking in flavor, freshness, and variety. The worst part was that the staff told us that all 3 breakfasts were different, so we felt mislead. The thing about staying here is that you…"

5,"This is my third stay here and I would not have returned if I didn't like it. The grounds are beautiful, well kept and full of amazing colours. The rooms are spacious and clean, though perhaps starting to feel their age ( they haven't changed much since my first visit 16 years ago). The restaurant prices seem more competitive than previous years, though drinks remain pricey compared to nearby local bars. There is free wifi, though it doesnt always reach all the rooms and you can only connect two devices free (why???). The children enjoyed the pool, there were always sunbeds available ( despite efforts of our Teutonic friends to reserve them with 7am towels!) and the beach is just ... right there.

5,I went to Bali on a business trip and stayed at the Grand Hyatt. The hotel is an imposing structure on the beachfront and has a dedicated access ot the sea for its guests. The hotel structure is well laid out and beutifully landscaped to create a tropical Bali experience right inside the hotel compound. Most of the rooms are at ground level and are surrounded by local flora and fauna with live fish swimming in counteless ponds full of lotus and water plants.  The rooms are tastefully decorated and designed with a dedicated seating and kids area with a small bay window bedside dedicated to it apart from the main kingsize bed.The bath has all the amenities one would expect in a world class hotel and is spacious even by 5 star standards.  There is plenty to do within the hotel…

5,"Hyatt was a good surprise for our 5 nights at nusa dua. When we arrived we got a room upgrade, the room as so spacious and with see view. We had always water and fruit at the room. The facilities are also very well maintained. The garden is well taken care, very relaxing and never very crowded. The only downside is the prices of food and services. Quite expensive for Balinese standards. "
4,"Grand bali is really huge, They have plenty of restaurants , 3-4 Pools , a temple and a dedicated shopping area. I loved the food and the place to the core. The place is really huge you'll have to walk a looot. Also checkout the Great Bali collection stores outside the campus. Overall a relaxing experience.."
5,"We have just returned from a fortnight at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua, and having racked our brains can't find anything to fault!  My husband, our two children aged 10 and 11 and I shared a standard room which had plenty of space for all of us, was serviced perfectly and had a lovely view of the coconut garden and the sea.  We loved watching the ducks, birds, squirrels and fish from our balcony, and it was a particular highlight if we saw the lizard swimming in the pond! We also had the bonus of watching a lovely wedding take place on the lawn.  The beds were comfortable, the air con was fine and there plenty of channels on the TV for the children to watch (generally very  briefly before they were fast asleep).  The vast army of staff were unfailingly helpful, charming and…"
5,"Me and my whole family stay at grand room at south Wings near The Balinese Pool, what a Great experience to stay here.  The room was spacious with King size bed Also huge sofa bed who acomodate for our kids, No need to Extra bed. Just ask for sheet and Extra pillow. Everything is clean and completed   My parent loves to Swimming at Balinese Pool In The morning, located outside our terrace. So lovely and quite. But kiddos more fun at main Pool with many play ground there. For Myself, I like doing workout at Bay Club gym just for cardio or just relaxing at hot tub. The Pool at Bay Club Also incredible.  Breakfast was awesone, I loves homemade pork ham. And couple glass of Yogurt. But The poor thing is they serve The same menu when we stay for 4 days, nothing change everydays.  …"
4,We had a memorable week there in 2010 with our friends we had a sea view room that was not really sea view because rooms all are ground floor and distance between rooms and sea is somehow 100 meter. Across the hotel was a shopping mall with so many different style restaurant which was very good it was a brazilian with live music it was very very good. It was a andonasian restaurant with most lovely manager i have ever seen.  There are so many small lagoon with water lily on and ducks and fish that create a lovely  area Breakfast was really good  Rooms were clean and staffs do anything to help you. The shopping mall that i have told you had so many hand made suvenier that worth visiting!!!

4,"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for the first 2 nights of my honeymoon.  Here are my pros and cons:  Pros: -The room was fantastic.  We had a Garden View King room (even though we paid our travel agent for an ocean view room...that's a different review though).  There was a really cool day bed and the room was huge!!  I was disappointed at first because we had paid for an ocean view room, but received a garden view.  It was difficult to stay disappointed because the garden view was gorgeous.    -Our reservation included breakfast.  The buffet was great.  There were so many different types of food and plenty of tables to accommodate the large breakfast crowd.  -The hotel grounds are stunning and it is so large that the pools were NEVER crowded.  I sent a few pictures back home and…"
3,"Right lets begin with the good aspects. Service at point of contact is generally superb. Almost everyone is friendly and happy to bend over backwards to help. The food quality is excellent although fairly limited. The grounds are immaculate and beautiful and the rooms fairly well equipped with UK style sockets for all your electrical goodies. Plenty of places to eat within the grounds with the best probably being the Balinese night market. Why they thought it a good idea to devote the seafront restaurant to Italian food is somewhat beyond me though! However, going on what else is available probably not worthy of its 5 star rating.  Now the bad points. Apart from the tourist trap 'Bali Collection' just outside Fortress Hyatt there isnt a lot to do. If travelling with youngsters…"
2,"Very disappointed with this hotel.  I choose this hotel base on review at tripadvisor. I stayed 4 nights with 4 rooms from 29 July until 2 August 2014. But what I've got ?     First check in at 1 pm they gave us only one room, the other 3 rooms still being prepare. I was waiting until 4 pm but still nothing, so I’m asking the recepsionist how were another 3 rooms? why there is no news ?!!   If the guest rooms not yet ready, why they not call and inform us, why have to wait the guest angry ?  Check-in time should be at 2 pm, but we have wait until 4 pm, and they even didn’t said sorry about it.  Shame on you…       The second day we stayed, got another suprise. While sitting on the terrace in the afternoon (room lagoon view) suddenly come out lizard from fish pond. I called the…"
1,"The Hyatt complex has a very nice facade but falls seriously short on delivering the quality and hotel safety that the looks and the price suggest.  Although rooms are very nice, the distances you have to cover are considerable and the walking path system is so winding and confusion and the signing so incomplete that you will get lost for the first two days unless you get a  room close to the center of the complex.  The food in the hotel is of very disappointing quality. The pasta they serve is precooked and then re-heated. When we pointed it out the waiter replied that they could of course make it fresh, if we wanted to wait. Interesting remark because we had to wait 20 mins for the pre-cooked pasta anyway. How long does it take to boil pasta?  The ""Parmesan"" they served also…"
5,"Stayed there for 5 days and first impression was that the welcoming reception was great, did not expect that after staying in similar starred hotels of Europe and America. Beach is so beautiful and the choice of pools is excellent for family having 2 young boys like me.  There is always a place to sit somewhere around the beach or pools for everyone (mind it that we came during holiday season).    Staff is excellent: all are VERY polite, friendly and ready to help.   Food are nice, even though pool side service can be slow during peak times. So if you have young kids, bringing your own snacks would be helpful while waiting for the food to come.    Totally adore dinner at Pasar Senggol.  Mosquitos are a bit of issue, but local mosquito repellents will help.  I dressed my youngest…"

The TV reception was very poor, we had dirty cups in the  room after house keeping had cleaned the room. I tried to ring room service for some fresh milk but no answer after 6 attempts, so I walked down to reception and asked for the milk which was sent to our room, the milk was the dried dairy milk in the sachets, I told the staff I wanted fresh milk and they said I had to ring room service, what was the point!  room a little dated but ok. great location and beach was the highlight."

But, if you decide you need something from your room, plan on a bit of a walk.  Also, the resort was extremely clean...but the beach is not always clean.

Rooms were super comfortable and spacious with full balconies.  The pools were beautifully landscaped and maintained and there were plenty of beach chairs on the adjacent beach!   The Club Longe is a beautiful outdoor pagoda surrounded by a pond with wild birds wandering around.  The reaort is a bit far from everything but there is an outdoor shopping mall across the street with several other restaurant choices.

We had a club room, mind you not sure it was a club room bc that wing was actually under construction, but room was generally fine. We were travelling with our 3 small children and all managed to fit into the one room, we had a patio that led out tot eh Balinese pool and that was just lovely, the pool was rarely used so it was almost like having our own private pool. The main pool was huge, kids slide was a major hit with our kids and the beach was nice, great walking out at low tide and checking out all the sea life.

The entrance is grand and gives a very picturesque impression and the welcome service was good. The rooms are housed in large 3 - 5 story buildings, giving the feeling that one is in more of an apartment block. That said, the room was fine, if a little dark.  There are plenty of restaurants, the best of which was the Italian, Salsa Verde. The food and service were both above average and it is located near the pool area. We also went to the Balinese restaurant for the evening 'dinner and a show'. The food…"

3,"We were staying at an ocean view room. When we checked in the room was very moist, including bed and floor. We considered it due to the tropical climate, but when we asked other guests they confirmed they didn't have moist beds. When asking guest service we were told that we must have left the balcony doors open. We were not in the room all day, however, the doors were closed, and the fact that we found the room like that upon arrival were not taken into consideration. "
5,"Great Hotel ,Beautiful gardens ,Lovely staff ,Top restaurants and Great location and now only 15 mins from the Airport .  Only small fault is we had a room for 3 Adults and one child and it really wasn’t quite big enough. Will be going back"
5,"Just returned from a 16 night holiday at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua Bali . It was absolutely amazing. The Hotel is huge, and spreads very nicely along a wonderful white sandy beach. The Hotel creates a beautiful ambiance with it's open air reception and lily pools everywhere you look. It boasts five swimming pools, but the way the Hotel has been built , these are not visible from the reception area. This Hotel is really worth a visit, the Staff are exceptional, and nothing is too much trouble , no matter what time of day. We booked an Ocean view room and was not disappointed, the view was magical , and the weather just wonderful for the whole time of our stay, around 30 / 32 everyday. Very close by to the Hotel is a complex called The Bali Collection, this is full of shops and all…"
4,"We stayed for four nights and really had a great time, kids were loving the pool. The beach isn't so great when we arrived (low tide) but still adding a value to your stay. Had a lovely dinner in Pasar Senggol complete with their Balinese dance performance. Staff were great and very helpful, some of them have been working since it was newly opened. Highly recommended for couples and families."
4,"The ambiance of the hotel landscaping and lagoons create a beautiful environment.  Lagoons, bridges, gorgeous landscaping & pools everywhere.  The grounds were so expansive that we never felt crowded. Surprisingly the open air restaurants were very comfortable late in June due to the constant ocean breeze.  We mainly ate breakfast in the open air restaurant surrounded by a peaceful lagoon filled with koi fish and dotted cranes.  It was gorgeous. We decided to have a couples massage...wonderful! It was a first class experience all the way.  Our suite was on a secluded lagoon and perfect zen experience & décor.  We really LOVED our experience & great value at Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua.  The only reason the rating is 4 out of 5 is the food, which was average,"
3,"We were staying at an ocean view room. When we checked in the room was very moist, including bed and floor. We considered it due to the tropical climate, but when we asked other guests they confirmed they didn't have moist beds. When asking guest service we were told that we must have left the balcony doors open. We were not in the room all day, however, the doors were closed, and the fact that we found the room like that upon arrival were not taken into consideration. "
5,"Great Hotel ,Beautiful gardens ,Lovely staff ,Top restaurants and Great location and now only 15 mins from the Airport .  Only small fault is we had a room for 3 Adults and one child and it really wasn’t quite big enough. Will be going back"
5,"Just returned from a 16 night holiday at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua Bali . It was absolutely amazing. The Hotel is huge, and spreads very nicely along a wonderful white sandy beach. The Hotel creates a beautiful ambiance with it's open air reception and lily pools everywhere you look. It boasts five swimming pools, but the way the Hotel has been built , these are not visible from the reception area. This Hotel is really worth a visit, the Staff are exceptional, and nothing is too much trouble , no matter what time of day. We booked an Ocean view room and was not disappointed, the view was magical , and the weather just wonderful for the whole time of our stay, around 30 / 32 everyday. Very close by to the Hotel is a complex called The Bali Collection, this is full of shops and all…"
4,"We stayed for four nights and really had a great time, kids were loving the pool. The beach isn't so great when we arrived (low tide) but still adding a value to your stay. Had a lovely dinner in Pasar Senggol complete with their Balinese dance performance. Staff were great and very helpful, some of them have been working since it was newly opened. Highly recommended for couples and families."
4,"The ambiance of the hotel landscaping and lagoons create a beautiful environment.  Lagoons, bridges, gorgeous landscaping & pools everywhere.  The grounds were so expansive that we never felt crowded. Surprisingly the open air restaurants were very comfortable late in June due to the constant ocean breeze.

5,"Stayed at the Grand Hyatt with family for 5 nights in mid June and our experience was fantastic. The hotel has probably one of the best locations as it is right opposite the Bali Collection ......a place for ample options for food , drinks and shopping. The resort is a bit old (as read in diff. reviews ) ...though we did not feel so at all except for one or two things in the room ( needs an air conditioning overhaul ) .The superb service makes up for all the minor glitches  and kudos to the service staff for taking care of their guest over such a vast property. The beach front is very nice and is like a mile of a private stretch with hotel guest as the only visitors. The pool area is great sweeps around giving ample space to everyone . The food at the poolside is super yummy and…"
5,"I wasn't ready to be enjoying luxury and my company was closing off its Asia-Pacific operation and we all got invited for a 3-day stay at Grand Hyatt, each to his own room!! Well, we all know the reputation of Grand Hyatt, and it's the best stay of my life :P. If money is not an issue, pamper yourself!"
2,"This hotel is too run down & needs an overhaul in their maintainence & decor. The ocean facing rooms are good but the air conditioning system is soooooo old that it hardly works & be ready to sweat on a summer night in your room, Food is just about average, the local desserts are pathetic. Try it out at your own risk !"
5,"I was at this hotel with my wife as our honeymoon from 3th to 8th of jul. 2014. It has a very fascinating and cozy lobby. The lobby is so simple in comparison with nearby resorts like westin or laguna but it was so relaxing. every time we entered the hotel at the end of the day we sat in the lobby and had a smoke with beautiful ocean view and relaxing bamboo music. We just loved the environment, beautiful garden, lagoons, sea side with adorable squirrels. The room was big and cozy too. All the restaurants were great with good view and excellent food. One of the big advantages in this hotel is that breakfast is served at three different places that prevents the place being crowded with long queues like in other hotels. The staff were very kind and polite. We asked for several…"
5,"Can't say that I loved Bali after spending January there, dirty, overdeveloped, etc., but I found the Grand Hyatt Bali an oasis of calm and relaxation. A Generously set out resort with great rooms and a fantastic Club lounge with its own wildlife show. Swimming pools and kids club were great and a walk around the area can be had with a minimum of hassles (unlike other parts of the island."

4,"We just came back from a very relaxing 5day stay at this hotel.  Grand Hyatt Bali Nusa Dua holds a lot of beautiful memories for my family.  First time I came here was in 1989 - the hotel was still brand-new, with my then-fiancee.  From then on, we would come here regularly with our baby son, and then another baby... This was our young family's favorite hotel for the most part of the '90's.  We liked their sprawling gardens (designed no less by the famous Made Wijaya), the many swimming pools, the lovely beach and the huge room perfect for a family of four.  Through the years, we have stayed in diff hotels in Bali, in diff areas, as our children were growing up.  Now that our children have grown up and are taller than both my hubby and I, and we are 2 years away from being…"
4,"All in all a good hotel for a conference, but I think if anyone was to pay the rack rate here they would be thinking that it wasn't the best value. Great rooms, with nice day beds etc but the wifi in the rooms and throughout the resort was patchy at best. Breakfast for us was in the Water cafe which was good enough, and the food throughout the conference was pretty good.   Like with most resorts in Nusa Dua, not much to do just outside of the resorts, but that's why people stay at resorts isn't it?"
4,"it's a great place if you would only to stay at hotel, play at beach, etc.  There's a shopping arcade in front.  This hotel is child friendly.  The room is large but some rooms very far from lobby.  For granny you can borrow wheelchair during stay."
5,"My wife and I just finished a 7-day stay. We utilized nearly every service the hotel had to offer. The grounds are immaculate. The staff is very friendly and incredibly professional (a special recognition to Urip and Sri at the Grand Hyatt Club Lounge...their service was top notch). The beach is beautiful. The room had a great view of the ocean. The service at the Kriya Spa was outstanding. I know this review seems a bit hyperbolic, but we were simply blown away by this Hyatt property. "
4,"Stayed in a Grand Club Room for 3 nights after not having been at this property for more than 15 years and the senior staff at the Grand Club said ""Welcome Back"", having recognised us from our previous stay...he (and several other staff) have been at the hotel for 20 years, and I must say his memory for faces blew us away!  If you want to be pampered, stay at the Grand Club section, a quiet separate area to socialise, be on your own, or just watch the birds, koi and ducks in the pond over which it is built.  While the exteriors and service were excellent, the rooms should have been re-done with more forethought: a few issues with the ""design for females"" with no electric plugs near mirrors for using her own hair dryer, dark orange-colored lights over the bathroom vanity, a…"

The activities in the hotel like the water aerobics, yoga makes it entertaining and a huge sprawling breakfast with freshly baked  croissants,pain au chocolat with freshly brewed tea and coffee. The pool bar is awesome and they give you nuts at the bar with ,I've music. I had seafood and pizza both were good but expensive.room service was great too, this lady from staff came and helped me pack my suitcase as I was unwell.

5,"Just spent two nights in Bali.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Grand Hyatt.  Stayed in a Grand Club Room which was spacious and really comfortable.  Took advantage of the Grand Club enjoying breakfast, mid-day snacks and happy hour.  The staff were friendly, gracious, professional and made me feel welcome.  The Grand Club setting is beautiful.  The property is huge and folks that like the smaller, boutique hotel experience will not like the Grand Hyatt.  There are four separate villages and numerous restaurants.  There is a nice beach fronting the hotel.  There were no jet skis or parasailing at the beach, so it was quiet and relaxing.  You can walk down the beach for all those activities.  The Bali Collection Shopping Center is next door with shopping, restaurants and massage places. …"
5,"We had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt Bali, the hotel grounds are simply stunning with lovely wildlife which my daughter loved (fish, birds, squirrels & lizards!). I was surprised to find on check in that we had been upgraded... To a suite!! The room was HUGE and it was extremely thoughtful of the hotel to include not only a baby cot, but a baby bath and a tub full of baby toiletries which we made full use of (bubble bath, shampoo, talc, flannel etc) it was thoughtful and practical. We were pretty overwhelmed by this gesture and was definitely a highlight of our holiday. The hotel grounds are huge but it was lovely to explore. The pools were beautiful and we found a favourite spot to sunbathe with perfect shade for our daughter too. The hotel guest relations desk were…"
5,"we stayed there for 4 nights. 6 adults and 6 children travelling together.. the rooms are big for families ,, the best we got in the whole trip, the swimming pools are multiple in numbers and have water slides for children which we all enjoyed.,the beach is beautiful resort itself is huge, we could not explore even half of it..  staff is really friendly. i just forgot my travel bag in taxi while travelling to discovery mall so was really worried,but when i called the hotel , they assured me that the bag would return to them in an hour time as they have all details of the taxi and the driver in which we travelled. and they did the same, room service is little slow as they are far from the rooms . the breakfast has hardly anything for vegetarians except salad(cucumber tomato and…"
5,"This is one of the most beautiful and luxurious hotels I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. The grounds were beautiful, the staff kind, patient and gracious and the accommodation wonderful.  We stayed here on honeymoon and despite getting the dreaded Bali belly would jump at the chance to return (I'd recommend avoiding the seafood though)  I highly rate the sunrises and sun sets, as well as the massages from the spa.

5,"For several years we have spent 10 to 14 days in The Grand Club at the Grand Hyatt at Nusa Dua. Without fail we have been made very welcome, had personalised service, and been pampered well. For us we come here to rest and relax, rather than for an adventure holiday.   The Grand Club staff have been able to arrange the best tables for us at restaurants such as La Luciola and Tapping Shoes, organise trips, transport, flights, tours and give great local advice. They are a friendly and efficient  team.  We tend to relax around the Club pool which is restricted to members so never more than ten people around the pool with 30 lounges from which to choose. Often we were alone, except for the attentive staff who would bring drinks and food, and the squirrels who played in the mature…"
5,We have just spent two wonderful weeks as a guest of the Grand Hyatt Bali. This is our second visit - last year we split our two weeks between another Nusa Dua hotel and the Grand Hyatt. We knew when we left the Hyatt last year we would return this year and are already planning our next Hyatt stay for 2015.  We enjoyed Grand Club privileges again this year and highly recommend this option - well worth the extra cost. We loved our lunches at the Pool Bar and evening meals at both Nampu and Salsa Verde.  The beach is beautiful and the pools and gardens are picture perfect.  The standout for us was the hospitality of all Staff - we loved our daily interactions with many employees across the resort - so many smiling faces.  Have started the countdown to next year's holiday.  Terima…
5,"Just arrived back in Melbourne after 2 memorable weeks at the Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua. (Stayed 13-27 June). I cannot talk highly enough of the staff and the way we were teated, we honestly fealt like long lost friends and truly valued guests. We had a lovely Oceanview room clean and quiet. We enjoyed meals at Nampu (Japanese ) and Salsa Verde (Mediterranean ) and many a tasty lunch by the Pool bar. Met many other Guests during our stay and all had similar experiences.Anybody considering a stay at Nusa Dua should seriously consider this property as you won't be disappointed. Already planning next years trip."
3,"It could be a very nice hotel if rooms were renovated and the access to all rooms was nice!  When we went to the room escorted by a front desk agent, we felt like going to the service area. As a matter of fact, we passed in front and were only 2 rooms away from it + part of the way was pretty dark.i have made a video about it. The room is big enough and quiet but needs renovation as it looks old now. The garden is really nice, certainly with the swimming pools 2 of the strongest assets of the hotel. There are few venues for the breakfast and i highly recommend to have your breakfast next to the beach. Nice way to start the day. Breakfast offer is good enough and the team is friendly once they know you.  The beach is good and the sand pleasant to walk on. Do some rooms renovation…"

But hotel need a lot of renovation now  The room was full of insects, ants, also had lizard in the room...!! The room was very stinky had foul smell of the washroom when lying down on the bed.

Room was lovely but I could have been anywhere In the world and air con arctic! I know why there are slippers to wear in the room, As the floor was like ice at times! Limited dining choices and you cannot walk down the street as you can elsewhere In the evenings. The Grand Club lounge was nice but you got the feeling that the expectation from the business guests is you dress up for breakfast! Our attire was neat and tidy and clean, for goodness sake we were on vacation! "

Our room was very spacious and had everything we needed including a well stocked bar, we ate at most of the restaurants which were very good, not too keen on the Japanese themed restaurant, I think that was just our personal choice and nothing to do with the food or service.  Pool heavenly, enjoyed lunch and drinks every day at the pool, not too busy.  Came home feeling totally rested"

4,"I'll get straight to the point:  Pros: - Service was indeed impeccable - We received a free upgrade to a bigger suite overlooking the ocean - Our flights back home were really late at night - we asked if we could extend our check out time - they had no hesitatation with that and we ended up checking out at 6pm! - We suggest every couple to get a spa package from Kraya Spa especially around sunset - nighttime - it was intimate, private and perfect  Cons: - Breakfast buffet was not included - for the amount we paid overall, you'd think we would get more bang for our buck  - The resort was beautiful - but to be honest we found it way too big and lacked the intimacy we were after (but thats just us)  Overall, it was a sound experience, but i think this place suits families more than…"

I think is better if children can take bicycle or scooter to play around the hotel, beach....is very beautiful and clean."
5,"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali with my family (including 2 kids aged 12 and 8) from June 18-23 and the resort exceeded our already high expectations based on experiences we have had at other Grand Hyatt properties.  Our youngest child has multiple severe food allergies (egg, dairy, nuts) which can make traveling difficult to say the least.  The Grand Hyatt Bali worked tirelessly to ensure that our son was always well-fed with food cooked to his dietary specifications.  Special recognition goes to Himawan Wasito, the Assistant Director of Food & Beverage at the resort.  Hima met us as soon as we arrived at check-in and proceeded to give us a guided tour of the property, including taking us to all the restaurants to meet the staff/chefs and explaining that the resort would be…"

Despite of that, worry no more when you have kids or to bring a nanny for your kids cause the room is provided with a kind of corner bed for extra person. About public area, this hotel i would say the best for what you looking for in Nusa Dua. The soft sandy beach, long integrated pool, even toddlers' pool, garden, ponds, chess field, jogging track, and Bali Collection is just steps away. The property is big but you won't feel it's too big because the surrounding is nice to walk by. I have to say it is a smart move to divide guests to have breakfast in some restaurants they have, so that it's not too crowded.  We stayed 2 nights on the weekend and when we arrived there was…"

The Lagoon Pool and River Pool were really nice, suitable for adults and kids alike.  A quieter pool, for those who want to have the pool to themselves, head for the pool next to the fitness gym.    The gym itself was more than adequate, with the right amount of equipment for holiday fitness workouts.  It was good enough for my daughter to keep up her exercises as a competitive swimmer.

Its grandeur adds to the experience. Its in Nusa Dua and right across the road is the ""Bali Collection"" - an open air shopping area with a nice art market to buy souvenirs, brand stores and a variety of restaurants. The only problem was that the wifi didn't work properly despite calling the service provider to fix the problem.  My personal fav was the breakfast by the beach. Highly recommended."
